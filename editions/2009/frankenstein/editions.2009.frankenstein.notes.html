               <li class="item" id="d30e219"><span class="term">a black and comfortless sky</span> 
                  <p>After the allusions to hell in these paragraphs the absence of any conventional sign
                     of heaven is starkly telling. So "hellish" has Victor's psychological state become
                     that the universe seems to have changed to reflect it. Even as one posits moral or
                     theological implications to this language, however, one must be conscious that the
                     megalomania that allowed Victor to presume to usurp God's prerogatives in the first
                     place might just as easily issue in changing the universe to suit the mood of his
                     mind. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e226"><span class="term">an absent child</span> 
                  <p>Victor is at this point twenty-three years old.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e233"><span class="term">my long absent son</span> 
                  <p>Victor is at this point twenty-three years old.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e240"><span class="term">a foreign accent</span> 
                  <p>Victor's native tongue is French, which, the reader will recall, is a language Walton
                     cannot speak (I:L2:02 and note).</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e247"><span class="term">acquirement of the knowledge which I sought</span> 
                  <p>By the time Mary Shelley made these revisions, Goethe's Faust, Part I, had become
                     a European classic. She knew the work well, not only because Percy Bysshe Shelley
                     had translated parts of it during his last months, but because she had twice prepared
                     the text of these—a partial version the first time, in The Liberal, the shortlived
                     periodical the Shelleys, Byron, and Leigh Hunt had projected—and then in full in her
                     1824 publication of Posthumous Poems of Percy Bysshe Shelley. The Faustian desire
                     for knowledge, of course, was also deeply implicated in the 1818 edition. Mary Shelley
                     was introduced to it shortly after she began work on her novel when Matthew (Monk)
                     Lewis, visiting Byron during the 1816 summer at Geneva, translated parts of it to
                     the assembled company. Faust also had a profound effect on Byron's dramatic poem Manfred,
                     begun shortly thereafter.</p> 
                  <p>The extent to which Walton here throws all caution to the winds will be balanced late
                     in the novel by Victor Frankenstein's adoption of the same kind of rhetoric in appealing
                     to the sailors on Walton's vessel to risk everything for the mission's success (See
                     III:WC:14). It is at that point that Walton's prudence and essential humanity return,
                     perhaps as a secondary effect of his having, in the meantime, by this outburst elicited
                     Victor's sobering account of the cost to him and to those he loved of his passion
                     for knowledge. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e256"><span class="term">a design which she never found reason to repent</span> 
                  <p>The first-time reader of this sentence would see no reason to pause and ponder its
                     import, but for one returning to the text and tracing its linguistic and thematic
                     linkages, it would hard to understand how Victor could speak in such bland terms about
                     circumstances his mother could not foresee but through which he has suffered inordinately.
                     Moreover, not only does he have strong personal reason to repent this "design," but
                     its fulfillment, as he bitterly knows, will result directly in the death of his father
                     (III:6:16).</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e263"><span class="term">advancement in his profession</span> 
                  <p>This, the first substantive change in the 1831 edition, speaks volumes on the shifts
                     in consciousness that have taken place during the thirteen years separating the two
                     editions. A separate middle-class identity and sense of upward mobility have become
                     endemic in British cultural attitudes, bringing heroic concepts like glory firmly
                     to earth.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e270"><span class="term">well advanced on my voyage</span> 
                  <p>The supposition is that Walton has met with a ship above Finland at the end of the
                     common sea-route out of the Russian port of Archangelsk. Here, at the top of Scandinavia,
                     as Walton continues his northern voyage, the other ship prepares to curve in a southerly
                     direction toward England. With its departure Walton loses his last contact with his
                     domestic circle: from now on he must prepare himself to be in isolation.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e277"><span class="term">a friend</span> 
                  <p>Slowly, if we compare this statement with the initial voicing of this theme in I:L2:2,
                     it begins to take on secondary associations. Here, the primary value of friendship
                     is to provide sympathy, which is here glossed not as mere compassion or genial fellow-feeling,
                     but as a mirror for the self that will be conducive to personal growth.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e284"><span class="term">again and again testify</span> 
                  <p>Only in retrospect will the conclusion of this letter take on additional meaning from
                     the remarkably heightened rhetoric indulged in by Walton here at its end. For Walton
                     so to "testify" is to "bear witness" before the world to a dependence upon and need
                     for his sister. In a narrative in which solitude and obsessiveness will come to seem
                     a threat to all normative human relationships, this prior assertion of the primacy
                     of human affection bears an ideological import. Students of English Romantic poetry
                     may even be reminded of the highly emotional faith with which Wordsworth turns to
                     his sister Dorothy in "Lines Written a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey", a poem that
                     will be quoted by Victor Frankenstein in an encomium to his friend Henry Clerval at
                     a point of structural balance with this passage, at the beginning of Volume 3 of the
                     novel (III:1:21).</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e291"><span class="term">These reflections have dispelled the agitation</span> 
                  <p>We are thus invited to return at this point to the beginning of Walton's letter (and
                     the novel), perhaps to reflect on the fact that the first noun we encounter in the
                     novel is "disaster" (I:L1:1). Clearly, however he may publicly suppress their effects,
                     Walton, to some extent at least, shares the "evil forebodings" of his sister he recalls
                     in that initial sentence. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e299"><span class="term">agony</span> 
                  <p>Several critics have noted the extent to which Mary Shelley goes out of her way, as
                     Victor brings his creation to life, to transpose the physical pains of childbirth
                     into an equivalent psychological state. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e306"><span class="term">Cornelius Agrippa</span> 
                  <p>Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim, 1486-1535, German mystic and alchemist.</p> 
                  <p>Agrippa of Nettesheim was born of a once-noble family near Cologne, and studied both
                     medicine and law there, apparently without taking a degree. In 1503, he assumed the
                     name Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim, adopting the von to suggest a noble background;
                     three years later, he established a secret society in Paris devoted to astrology,
                     magic, and Kabbalah.</p> 
                  <p>His career is diverse: secret agent, soldier, physician, orator, and law professor,
                     in Cologne, Paris, Dôle, London, Italy, Pavia, and Metz. In 1509, he set up a laboratory
                     in Dôle in the hopes of synthesizing gold, and for the next decade or so traveled
                     Europe, making a living as an alchemist, and conversing with such important early
                     humanist scholars as Colet and Reuchlin. In 1520, he set up a medical practice in
                     Geneva, and in 1524 became personal physician to the queen mother at the court of
                     King Francis I in Lyons. When the queen mother abandoned him, he began practicing
                     medicine in Antwerp, but was later banned for practicing without a license, and became
                     historiographer at the court of Charles V. After several stays in prison, variously
                     for debt and criminal offenses, he died in 1535.</p> 
                  <p>Agrippa's wrote on a great many topics, including marriage and military engineering,
                     but his most important work is the three-volume De occulta philosophiae (written c.
                     1510, published 1531), a defense of "hidden philosophy" or magic, which draws on diverse
                     mystical traditions -- alchemy, astrology, Kabbalah. A later work, De incertitudine
                     et vanitate scientiarum (Of the Uncertainty and Vanity of the Sciences), attacks contemporary
                     scientific theory and practice.</p> 
                  <p>Many of his opinions were controversial. His early lectures on theology angered the
                     Church, and his defense of a woman accused of witchcraft in 1520 led to his being
                     hounded out of Cologne Cologne by the Inquisition. In his own day, Agrippa was widely
                     attacked as a charlatan. After his death, legends about him were plentiful. Some believed
                     him to be not only an alchemist but a demonic magician, even a vampire. In one account,
                     he traveled to the New World.</p> 
                  <p>In 1799, Robert Southey published an amusing ballad on this man, suggestive of his
                     later reputation as a master of black magic, as well as of his susceptibility to gothic
                     trappings. Percy Bysshe Shelley listed Agrippa and Paracelsus among his favorite writers
                     in a discussion with Godwin in 1812. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e324"><span class="term">experiments on an air-pump</span> 
                  <p>The air-pump—what a later age would call a vacuum-chamber—was an important part of
                     any eighteenth-century chemical laboratory. Darwin, for instance, notes an experiment
                     with an air-pump in the fifth of the Additional Notes to his Temple of Nature. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e331"><span class="term">Albertus Magnus</span> 
                  <p>Albertus Magnus (1193 or 1206-1280), German monk and alchemist, known as "Doctor Universalis."</p> 
                  <p>Born to a noble family in Bavaria, Albertus (Albert von Bollstüdt) became an adherent
                     to the newly formed Dominican Order while he was a student at Padua in 1223. After
                     being ordained in Germany, he traveled to Paris and in 1245 became master of theology
                     at the University there. His most famous student was Thomas Aquinas. Albertus had
                     a lifelong interest in the natural sciences (at a time when alchemy had not yet been
                     sharply distinguished from more legitimate sciences such as chemistry), and was an
                     important scholar of Aristotle, whose influence pervaded both his scientific and his
                     religious writings.</p> 
                  <p>From 1260 to 1262, Albertus was the bishop of Regensburg, the nearest principal medieval
                     city on the Danube to the north of Ingolstadt. He died in Cologne in 1280. Not long
                     after his death, a number of writings on magic circulated under his name, although
                     the validity of these attributions is questionable.</p> 
                  <p>Albertus was beatified in 1622. In 1931, Pope Pius XI declared him a saint and a Doctor
                     of the Church; in 1941, Pope Pius XII named him the patron saint of those who study
                     the natural sciences. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e344"><span class="term">a league</span> 
                  <p>This is how the Oxford English Dictionary represents this obsolete measure:</p> 
                  <p>LEAGUE</p> 
                  <p>league lig, sb.1 Forms: 4-5 leghe, 4-6 lege, leuge, (4 lewge, 5 lewke, leuke, leeke),
                     5-6 leege, 6 legge, le(a)que, Sc. lig, 6-7 leag(e, 6- league. Late ME. leuge, lege,
                     leghe, etc., ad. late L. leuga, leuca (= late Gr. leu'gh, leu'kh), according to Hesychius
                     and Jordanes a Gaulish word; hence OFr. liue, liwe (mod.Fr. lieue), Pr. lega, legua,
                     Cat. llegua, Sp. legua, Pg. legoa, Ital. lega. </p> 
                  <p>An itinerary measure of distance, varying in different countries, but usually estimated
                     roughly at about 3 miles; app. never in regular use in England, but often occurring
                     in poetical or rhetorical statements of distance.</p> 
                  <p>Thus, a league outside Geneva. would be, perhaps, an hour's easy walk from the town.
                     </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e360"><span class="term">the creature . . . might still be there, alive</span> 
                  <p>It is clear, to invoke the customary alternatives, that to Victor at this point "dead"
                     would be far preferable to "alive." The ugliness of the morality behind his ruminations
                     here seems not to occur to him.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e367"><span class="term">all at once become so extremely wicked</span> 
                  <p>The doltishness with which Ernest speaks cannot obscure the moral question implicit
                     here. The reliance on simplistic moral absolutes will extend outward from Ernest to
                     involve his father (I:6:37), who has been established from the beginnings of Victor's
                     narrative as a citizen of consequence, and he will then in the next chapter be joined
                     by other men of consequence in Geneva, from the Church to the magistracy, in a miscarriage
                     of justice. Victor's intuition of the murderer, as well as his own intellectual research
                     beyond conventional limitations, isolates him from the other male upholders of establishment
                     values. This does give Victor a certain moral authority not apparent before, but it
                     is heavily shadowed by his silence as the travesty of Justine's trial unfolds. Only
                     Elizabeth, like Justine a woman and without effectual power, is able through sheer
                     human sympathy to "judge" aright in this case.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e374"><span class="term">all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer, than that one guilty should
                     escape</span> 
                  <p>Victor's bitterness over the law may reflect Godwin's teachings about its arbitrary
                     nature and conformist tendencies, as well as Percy Bysshe Shelley's own legal problems
                     with his father during Mary's first years living with him. We see similar sentiments
                     in Elizabeth's aversion to the law as a profession for Ernest, which is expressed
                     in a passage in the first edition (I:5:2 and note).</p>

                  <p>This word, which as a noun entered the novel with Walton rhapsodizing over his passion
                     for discovery (I:L4:20), is now picked up by Victor as if deliberately to echo and
                     admonish the mariner. It will toll repetitively—and resonantly—through the remainder
                     of this chapter. It seems clear that Mary Shelley, capitalizing on her strategy in
                     1818, is here emphasizing the word in all its ambiguity. The complex of associations
                     in its definition can be tracked here. </p>

                  <p>Mary Shelley's journal notes indicate that she was sporadically reading in Robert
                     Southey's translation of Amadis of Gaul, a Spanish chivalric romance by Garcia de
                     Montalvo, during the early months of 1817. At this time she was also actively working
                     on Frankenstein.</p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e395"><span class="term">science of anatomy</span> 
                  <p>The University of Ingolstadt medical faculty and particularly the anatomy theater
                     would have offered Victor unparalleled resources for pursuit of this new phase of
                     his studies.</p> 
                  <p>The medical school, which today houses the German Museum of the History of Medicine,
                     was known as the Anatomie upon its completion in 1736. That designation is still recalled
                     in the street name on which the edifice stands. </p>

                  <p>Frankenstein is a novel that centers on a transgressive birth; it is replete with
                     orphans and both women and men who, cut off in their youth, die without creating children
                     of their own. In contrast to the actual terms of the work, Victor begins his narrative
                     by emphasizing normative and extended family structures.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e412"><span class="term">the Angel of Destruction</span> 
                  <p>Mary Shelley's emendations of 1831 once again link early statements in Victor's narrative
                     with his condition when he is rescued by Walton's crew, a frantic and paranoid specter
                     whose otherworldly mystifications, as expressed in the late chapters of Volume 3,
                     are a driving force in his obsessive pursuit of the Creature. It is interesting to
                     note that even this late in her work on the novel Mary Shelley is recalling the machinery
                     with which Percy Bysshe Shelley invested his poem centering on the uncompromising
                     pursuit of a love object, "Alastor; or, the Spirit of Solitiude," published in March
                     of 1816, shortly before the two left for Switzerland.</p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e419"><span class="term">Coleridge's "Ancient Mariner"</span> 
                  <p>Coleridge's "Ancient Mariner" (1798), lines 451-56—with "who" substituted for "that"
                     in line 451. (In the 1817 revision, the passage occupies lines 445-450.) The second
                     direct allusion to this poem in the novel: the first occurs in Walton's second letter
                     to Mrs. Saville (I:L2:6).</p> 
                  <p>"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner," is frequently also the subject of subtle allusion
                     (see, for instance, I.2.7 and note, or III.1.8 and note) casts a long shadow over
                     its conceptions.</p> 
                  <p>There is nothing odd about this, for Coleridge bore an unusual weight in the house
                     in which Mary Godwin was raised. William Godwin, although separated from Coleridge
                     on key matters of philosophy and theology, was deeply attached to him, calling him
                     one of his four "oral instructors." Accordingly, Coleridge was a frequent guest in
                     the Godwin household. Mary Shelley never forgot the experience of hearing Coleridge
                     recite his "Rime" as she hid behind the sofa. Given Coleridge's brilliance in conversation,
                     she may have imbibed more from her youthful encounters with him than a later time
                     can ever know. Certainly, the implicit tribute accompanying her frequent allusions
                     to him in the course of Frankenstein suggests a deep and personalized admiration.

                  <p>Although as a novel Frankenstein is highly ingenious in its interweaving of omens,
                     it also casts those who believe in them in a sharply reflexive light. In particular,
                     Victor's account of his life as buffeted by a continual sway of destiny tends to exculpate
                     him from responsibility for his choices and his actions.</p>
               </li>

                  <p>Walton is anxious not just because his way is barred but because the icefield, in
                     expanding, could easily crush the hull of his ship. That process, called "nipping,"
                     was a major danger to wooden-hulled boats in arctic regions.</p>

                  <p>There have been veiled if persistent questions raised thus far about Victor's mental
                     stability. These will slowly increase over the course of the novel, to such an extent,
                     indeed, that near its end (III:WC:26), Walton has every reason to think he is himself
                     listening to "the ravings of insanity." Questions of conventional expectations and
                     of documentary evidence are present on all levels of this novel, in issues ranging
                     from verisimilitude in writing to justice in society.</p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e451"><span class="term">a plain and simple explanation of the facts</span> 
                  <p>Justine discounts how much eloquence counts in her world, and in this novel (see,
                     for instance, I:L4:24and note). But if a plain, unvarnished recital of facts cannot
                     exonerate one, the novel asks, in what does truth exist? Compare Mary Wollstonecraft's
                     disavowal of eloquence at multiple points in A Vindication.</p>

                  <p>This phrase, which is the first written in reflexive thought about the Creature, immediately
                     establishes a threat to presumptions of scientific facticity, as the presence of this
                     alien existence casts its shadow over all facile assumptions and assurances, leaving
                     uncertainty in its wake. Such indeterminacy will increasingly come to dominate the
                     narrative of events in Frankenstein. The fact that the Creature and Victor are traveling
                     not over solid land but upon the fragile surface of ice is exactly emblematic of the
                     problematic nature of reality that Mary Shelley introduces to the novel here.</p>

                     this geographical reference to echoes in the previous paragraph of the language of
                     the fallen Archangel Satan would seem playfully intentional. </p>

                     I:3:1 and note; also the definition), is at last recognized here as an energy exceeding

                  <p>Angelica is the heroine of Ariosto's epic romance Orlando Furioso (1516-32). In the
                     first edition this is one of the works from which Henry Clerval wrote plays for himself,
                     Elizabeth, and Victor to act (see I:1:11 and note). Thus, this would be a natural
                     reference for Elizabeth to make, suggestive of her long intimacy with the two young
                     men her letter implicitly addresses.</p>

                  <p>Waldman points to a distinctive feature of scientific discourse of the later eighteenth
                     and early nineteenth century. From Carolus Linnaeus (1707-1778), who in the study
                     of botany established the terms for the classification of plants, to John Dalton (1766-1844)
                     who in chemistry determined the universal table of atomic weights, late Enlightenment
                     science was extensively engaged in taxonomic classification.</p>

                  <p>Astronomy was another science, like chemistry, undergoing marked advances in England
                     during Mary Shelley's day. The major force behind this was Sir William Herschel, assisted

                  <p>We will later discover (III:WC:4) that it was not "nearly" enough for Victor, who
                     proceeds to rewrite Walton's narrative. But, then again, it could very well be his
                     own narrative that he so conscientiously revises. Whatever the particular case is
                     immaterial: what matters is the fact of emendation. Mary Shelley's deliberate accentuation
                     of the unreliability of her text will recur at crucial points throughout the novel.</p>

                  <p>The uncertainty that enveloped the Creature in the early paragraphs of this letter
                     now surrounds Victor as well. He and Walton do not, at least at this point, perceive
                     the same reality.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e631"><span class="term">astonishment of the students</span> 
                  <p>The condescension Victor so easily adopts toward Professor Krempe here seems to extend
                     as well to his peers among the students. Within another chapter we will witness yet
                     a further example of how Victor's sense of superiority combines with an almost instinctive
                     aversion to those he considers in some sense inferior to him. His observation here
                     may thus be intended by Mary Shelley to help prepare us for his sudden rejection of
                     the Creature to whom he gives life. Yet it might also be designed to bear a double
                     reading: not just that Victor's fellow-students are in awe of his commitment, but
                     that they are aware of something neurotic in its intensity.</p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e638"><span class="term">a strange tale</span> 
                  <p>When Walton resumes his narrative in Volume 3 (III:WC:1) his words will echo Victor's
                     here, as he calls the narrative a "strange and terrific story" and acknowledges that
                     the "tale is connected, and told with the appearance of the simplest truth," phrases
                     suggestive of how broadly the judging of truth is an issue in the novel.</p> 
                  <p>This phrasing also introduces the complicating factor of the novel's deliberately
                     involuted structure. To adapt Walton's language, Victor's account of the strange tale
                     occurs within his own strange tale, which has already conveyed the narrative of William's
                     death provided by his father (as well as, in the chapter before, Elizabeth's account
                     of local doings). This tale will be told twice more, in the courtroom (I:7:6) and
                     in the Creature's autobiographical summation (II:8:33). If, in the end, readers can
                     assume that they are able to sift the truth from its excessive narrative elaboration,
                     the fact remains that in the official account Justine Moritz will be known as the
                     murderer, and no one in Victor's family—including Ernest, who will presumably inherit
                     a substantial fortune and the position that goes with it and his family's reputation
                     in Geneva—will ever be any the wiser. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e648"><span class="term">at one time for five, and at another for nearly two years</span> 
                  <p>Justine, we remember from Elizabeth's letter to Victor (I:5:4), had come to imitate
                     the expression and demeanor of Caroline Frankenstein. Thus, having lived with the
                     Frankenstein family for seven years, which is the age at which William was murdered,
                     she has in some sense become a surrogate for his mother who died when William was
                     yet an infant. Further in the paragraph, Elizabeth explicitly compares her treatment
                     of William as "like [that of] a most affectionate mother."</p> 
                  <p>This detail, which has no effect on anyone outside the family circle, would seem intended
                     by Mary Shelley to insinuate a class bias into the court proceedings. Although Elizabeth
                     speaks of her almost as a member of the family, she is not so seen by the judges or
                     the populace of Geneva. Whatever the circumstance that separates her from an equality
                     with other family members, the important issue is the very principle of separation
                     by which she can be socially cast as a scapegoat. </p>

                     nursing Victor Frankenstein back from a state of near-death to Caroline Beaufort's
                     attendance on her despondent father in his decline. Such nurturing is a continual

                     are accorded a privileged value in this novel, though by no means in the world that
                     encompasses its fiction. Justine Moritz's attendance on Victor's mother in her final
                     illness earns for her no particular credence from her judges (I:7:10), and his mother,
                     contracting scarlet fever from nursing Elizabeth, dies as a result of her good offices

                  <p>Readers have nothing at this point from which objectively to compare Walton's surmises.
                     From Victor's own narration, however, it will be clear, that he is not particularly
                     drawn to the natural world the way his friend Clerval is portrayed as being (I:5:17);
                     indeed, while engaged in his scientific pursuits, he confesses himself wholly oblivious
                     to the attractions of the natural world (I:3:10). Rather than sense a narrative disjuncture
                     from this evidence, however, we might consider it a deliberate attempt on Mary Shelley's
                     part to distance herself and her readers from Walton's increasingly inflated language.
                     The figure Victor will cut in his own narration is very much darker than the one to
                     whom we are being introduced through Walton's eyes. The underlying problem of how
                     perspective shapes reality is thus being subtly reinforced.</p>

                     Professor Krempe (I:2:12). Now it operates to overpower any sense of shared humanity
                     with the Creature. In respect to the master categories of eighteenth-century aesthetics,
                     the Creature is exactly the opposite of the Beautiful: he is the embodiment of the
                     Sublime, at once awesome and terrifying. If most of our experience with sublimity
                     is mediated through art and literature, the Creature in all his encounters forces
                     it with stunning immediacy into normative human life, always with disastrous consequences</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e728"><span class="term">been destroyed</span> 
                  <p>Victor suddenly shows a political consciousness that has not been active up to this
                     point. The context suggests that the enclosed world of the domestic affections, governed
                     by a feminine sensibility, is threatened—and through history actually destroyed—by
                     the masculinist drive for power. This is a sentiment with which both her father William
                     Godwin and her husband Percy Bysshe Shelley would have agreed. In the shadow of the
                     Napoleonic Wars and the reinstitution of reactionary monarchies across Europe, it
                     is a sentiment not in accord with the prevailing state of political opinion in England.</p> 
                  <p>It could be argued that Victor simply serves momentarily as mouthpiece for the author's
                     pointedly liberal views to surface. What would complicate that supposition is the
                     fact that this series of political failures is identical with those the Creature derives
                     from the oral reading of Volney's Ruins of Empire by Felix De Lacey (see II:5:14).
                     If we focus on that identity retrospectively, we are suddenly confronted with the
                     amazing fact that Victor, whether he registered it or not, will actually learn something
                     concrete from the Creature's narration in the second volume of the novel. </p>

                     later in Walton's letter (I:L4:13), twice referring to him as a "man," whereupon Victor
                     automatically renames him as "daemon."</p>

                     affording a picturesque view of Geneva and the mountains beyond it. That the Frankenstein
                     family possesses a country house testifies to their comparative wealth and social
                     standing in the community, an issue that will be of some moment to the trial recounted
                     in I:7:1. After its painful conclusion the family will seek tranquillity in a return

                  <p>Bellerive is where the fifteen-year-old Victor witnessed the violent thunderstorm
                     (I:1:22) that started his obsession with the powers of electricity: thus, it is particularly
                     appropriate that the "most violent storm" occurs in this area. </p>

                  <p>The repetition of the adjective "benevolent" three times in as many paragraphs indicates
                     the stress Mary Shelley places on this as a fundamental attribute of human virtue.
                     However it may be stressed in Victor's memory, the frequency with which such benevolence
                     is actually encountered as a motivating force will be tested when the Creature flees
                     Victor's apartment and attempts to make his way in the world.</p>

                  <p>Victor's stress on the term marks it as of particular importance to him and indicates
                     that it is also of concern to the novel. With some pathos, Victor will begin the second
                     volume by recalling that he had himself "begun life with benevolent intentions" (II:1:1).
                     At this point we cannot know how far from disinterested benevolence Victor has strayed.
                     In retrospect, however, the novel's readers can easily comprehend why fervent emotions
                     would be generated in him by a return to civilized human standards and ethical conduct.</p>

                     and women (I:L1:1 and note), so this initial paragraph of the first chapter accentuates
                     the concern of the patriarchy with replicating itself. Alphonse Frankenstein's sense
                     of public purpose is to reproduce himself for the good of the state. By suppressing
                     the role of the female in this process, he paradoxically voices what will become his
                     son's obsession with creating a new man without the intervention of woman. With that
                     creation in mind, however, it does not require of the reader an undue stretching of
                     the sense to regard the distinctive tone of this language, so abstracted and clinical,
                     as being more characteristic of Victor than of his father.</p>

                     Victor Frankenstein's discovery is related to that fundamental aim of alchemy and
                     thus is the culmination of the fascination with the occult sciences that has been

                  <p>This would appear to be an in-joke among the writing friends, since Lord Byron's name,
                     in Geneva, would have been pronounced in the same French manner as this young friend
                     of Elizabeth's would be, bee-ROHN. Byron intended to give Allegra, the illegitimate
                     daughter Claire Clairmont bore in January 1817, the name of Biron.</p>

                  <p>The same noun is employed by Alphonse Frankenstein in the previous chapter (I:6:37).
                     The word conveys a sense of obligation and therefore of class difference. Again and
                     again it is emphasized that Justine has been raised above her rank in life by the
                     active interest of the Frankenstein household in her welfare. But has she really altered
                     her condition? Not just the family but the whole of Geneva society condescend to her
                     as having less than full rights to her supposedly respectable condition. The ease
                     with which her claims to equity are abrogated implicitly places her on a par with
                     Victor's Creature, named a wretch and denied the claim of human sympathy.</p>

                  <p>What is odd about this statement is not the sense of guilt embedded in it—Victor,
                     we will learn, has much to acknowledge on that score—but how unpenitent is the language
                     that expresses it. Victor's "not . . . altogether" phrase so strongly hedges the confession
                     that it calls attention to his rhetoric as self-serving, less than candid, and perhaps
                     not to be wholly trusted. </p>

                  <p>Although Mary Shelley surely exaggerates the time it took her to begin her novel as
                     well as the anxious writer's block that inhibited her starting forth, there is a more
                     serious aspect to this account than her personal uncertainties. Questions concerning
                     the circumstances of and responsibility for creativity, the attitude with which intellectual
                     ambition approaches the unknown, and the moral neutrality of the human imagination,
                     are deeply inlaid within the structure of Frankenstein. There is thus a sense in which
                     this personal account in her Introduction seems intended to focus attention on such
                     larger, more public concerns with which the reader will soon be asked to grapple.</p>

                  <p>That the power that Victor will use to create life is initially associated with destruction
                     is significant for the symbolic course of the novel. The Creature thus empowered will
                     ultimately be responsible for three murders.</p> 
                  <p>Erasmus Darwin explains the destructive force of lightning as resulting from the emission
                     of light and heat through the admixture of what he calls the vitreous and resinous
                     ethers, in modern terms essentially positive and negative electrical charges (though
                     he is arguing against Benjamin Franklin's mechanical model of electricity). See Note
                     XII, sections 2.7, 8.1, and 11.2 of the Additional Notes to his Temple of Nature.
                     </p> 
                  <p>That the forces of nature are equally devoted to creation and destruction is an issue
                     whose dynamics are central to Byron's conception in Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, Canto
                     3, and one, likewise, that Percy Bysshe Shelley will later explore in such poems as
                     "The Cloud" and the "Ode to the West Wind," poems dating from 1819. In those latter
                     poems one can sense the influence of Indian sacred texts like the Bhagvat-Gita. It
                     is by no means far-fetched to suggest their applicability to Mary Shelley's large
                     framing conception of this novel. </p>

                  <p>The difference in the Genesis account of human creation could not be more pronounced:</p> 
                  <p>1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them
                     have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the
                     cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the
                     earth.</p> 
                  <p>1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male
                     and female created he them.</p> 
                  <p>1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and
                     replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and
                     over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</p> Victor's adjective "breathless" may be intended by Mary Shelley to resonate ironically
                  against the moment in Genesis in which Adam is actually brought to life: 2:7 And the
                  LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the
                  breath of life; and man became a living soul.</li>

                     perpetually snow-covered, white ("Blanc"), thus "bright." Walking southwest toward

                  <p>Walton is referring obliquely to the wide-spread practice of flogging to keep discipline
                     aboard ship. It had been a serious issue in Great Britain during the Napoleonic Wars,
                     a spur to the mutinies that took place in the British navy at Spithead and the Nore
                     in the spring of 1797. The Shelleys' friend Leigh Hunt wrote several attacks on the
                     practice in his weekly newspaper The Examiner. The ship's master would have the responsibility
                     for maintaining order, and what most attracts Walton to this veteran mariner is his
                     capacity to do so without violence.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e896"><span class="term">Buffon</span> 
                  <p>Georges Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, 1707-1788, French naturalist.</p> 
                  <p>Buffon spelled out his views in his monumental Natural History (Histoire naturelle,
                     générale et particulière), an attempt to present systematically all the known facts
                     of natural science, of which the first volumes appeared in 1749 and the final volumes
                     in 1804.</p> 
                  <p>Buffon rejected Linnaeus's method of classifying species, insisting instead on smooth
                     gradations between not only species but individual organisms. Although he was willing
                     to use anatomical structures to make working distinctions between species, he believed
                     any division into orders, classes, genera, and species misrepresented the variety
                     of nature.</p> 
                  <p>His own experiments, however, caused him to think seriously about the idea of the
                     species. Buffon discovered that animals of different species could be crossbred, but
                     the offspring were infertile: he therefore defined a species as a group of animals
                     that could produce fertile offspring.</p> 
                  <p>Buffon did believe in the idea of the mutation of species, and was the first to suggest
                     the possibility that all animals might have descended or evolved ultimately from a
                     single breeding pair. He rejected the notion of evolution, however, favoring instead
                     a devolutionary theory: animals over time fell off by degrees from their originally
                     perfect state. The broad range of his scientific interest includes subjects of direct
                     import for Frankenstein: comparative geography, the diversification of types within
                     a species, the sexual origin of species, and monsters. </p> 
                  <p>Buffon's most important work in physical anthropology appeared in The Varieties of
                     the Human Species (1749), in which he described the physical and cultural differences
                     between groups of humans. He attributed these differences to the races' accommodation
                     to different environmental conditions.</p> 
                  <p>This well-known theory is alluded to in a letter that Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote his
                     long-time friend Thomas Love Peacock during the Geneva summer of 1816. That citation,
                     in turn, was included in the last letter appended to Mary Shelley's History of a Six
                     Weeks' Tour. </p>

                     Walton here becomes carried away by his enthusiasm. In terming what impels him a "burning
                     ardour," he utters what is almost a code word in the novel, designating a feature
                     shared by the male protagonists whose value, like the other shared attribute of curiosity,
                     is complexly ambiguous. He has already declared himself overly ardent (I:L1:2). Soon,

                     a single horse, a small vehicle for a trip of 500 miles. Since Victor mentions "horses"
                     in the plural, perhaps Mary Shelley intended to allow him a larger vehicle for his
                     journey than the type she names. In circumstances like this, the traveller would ride

                  <p>Although the extent of Victor's losses must await his own narration, his despairing
                     language here calls attention to itself and introduces several themes that will be
                     developed in the course of the novel. One is psychic death: a person who cannot renew
                     life is, in some profound sense, not truly alive, a condition made famous by Coleridge
                     in the idea of "Life-in-Death" advanced in "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner," line
                     193. Philosophically speaking, Victor's language reflects a deterministic viewpoint.
                     Readers will observe how often he invokes destiny or a like sense of fatality driving
                     the course of his existence. </p>

                     to his publisher John Murray by Percy Bysshe Shelley when the group returned to England
                     in the late summer. Mary Shelley directly quotes from this canto early in the novel

                     perhaps long before that) Victor has only been able to look within. The emphasis clearly
                     invokes the idea of nature in its broad range of signification.</p>

                     from his dreams into a new and alien perspective on his obsession. There is a faint
                     resonance of the "disaster" that Margaret Saville is recorded in the novel's first
                     sentence (I:L1:1) as foreseeing for Walton's expedition. The stark word would have
                     borne another kind of resonance in Mary Shelley's culture: Buffon'sNatural History
                     gave wide currency to a catastrophic theory of creation, and Victor's adolescent delight
                     in that account (at least as it is recounted in the first edition of the novel—see
                     I:1:25) would thus seem to have left an indelible, ironic imprint on him.</p>

                  <p>Mary Shelley's general dismissal of Roman Catholicism in this novel should be placed
                     within the context of centuries of British abuse of the religion from which Henry
                     VIII severed his country's ties. Although such official disfavor would change markedly
                     during the nineteenth century, it is well to understand that Catholic Emancipation

                     theory," gravitation.</p> 
                  <p>That a unified field theorem is a still unrealized ideal of experimental physics,
                     one that has excited the ambitions of major scientific minds in all quarters of the

                     Mary Shelley's novel. Without denigrating those ambitions here, she characteristically
                     reminds us of human limitations in Walton's inability to recognize that in a land
                     of eternal light, as he imagines the pole might be, celestial observations would be

                  <p>Most modern commentators would dispute this statement strongly, taking exception both
                     stylistically and substantively, and tending to see the 1831 edition as truly a reconception
                     of the 1818 edition rather than the tidying-up suggested here. But it is not entirely
                     easy to focus categorically on the differences between the texts. Some political innuendos
                     of moment in 1818, for instance, were no longer relevant to the changed climate in
                     the year before the Great Reform Bill, but that does not mean that others—for instance,
                     the curious intrusion of imperialism into the plot (see I:6:14 and note)—have not
                     taken their place. Mary Shelley did greatly rewrite the first chapter of 1818 breaking
                     it into two separate chapters in 1831. She similarly reworked the opening chapter
                     of Volume 2. Throughout her revision she endeavors to flesh out her characters rather
                     than merely to add descriptive elements to the novel. In this regard, her most extensive
                     elaboration is in making Victor's account of his life from the very beginning subtly
                     reflect the paranoid mental condition to which experience has reduced him.</p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e1010"><span class="term">enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety</span> 
                  <p>This poses a contrast worth contemplating: on the one hand, as earlier in the chapter
                     (I:3:8 and note), enthusiasm here literally suggests the presence of an indwelling
                     deity, or at least Victor's aspiration to play God; on the other hand, anxiety indicates
                     a counterforce within his mind, disrupting his self-assurance, even prompting self-alienation.
                     Since in Milton's myth Satan is created as a counterforce at the precise moment that
                     God announces his plan to create a new race, these contrary poles are essential to
                     the basic creation myth in terms of which Mary Shelley plots her novel.</p>

                  <p>Victor's blasé consent is in sharp contrast with his sense of follow-through, and
                     his truancy from school is indicative of an increasing drift from his father's influence.
                     Perhaps it is meant as well to be ominous, a sign of future laxness in seeing his
                     scientific work through to a successful conclusion. </p>

                  <p>During the latter part of the eighteenth-century the life sciences were undergoing
                     a radical transformation of their conduct, substituting scrupulous taxonomic categorization
                     and rigorous inductive experimentation for the slippery conceptual ordering and deductive
                     animism inherited from medieval and Renaissance paradigms. The exacting science of
                     chemistry influenced these developments and, in turn, was given impetus by the responsiveness
                     of the life sciences to their renewed systemization. When Victor speaks of a "rational
                     theory," he means, at least in part, such a logical ordering of constituent knowledge
                     within the discipline. In the early decades of the nineteenth century, particularly
                     in Great Britain under the guidance of figures like John Dalton and Humphrey Davy,
                     chemistry made enormous advances in basic knowledge, winning for the discipline something
                     of a cachet among educated people. </p>

                     world of childhood is privileged—Wordsworth's "Ode: Intimations of Immortality" is
                     a prime example—still the timbres here are unmistakeably Victorian, another sign of
                     the major shift in British culture during the 1820s. The nostalgic sentimentality,
                     however, rather veils the way in which Victor displaces upon his parents the mode
                     of his future conduct in life. His tacit abdication of responsibility will be repeated
                     in a more overt manner further on in his account. </p>

                  <p>Frankenstein is a novel haunted by the spectre of death. Not yet a quarter of the
                     way through the novel, the reader will encounter in Justine the fifth orphan (after
                     Walton and his sister, Caroline, and Elizabeth). Beyond this repeated pattern, death
                     has touched each chapter of the novel, first as Walton recounts how he inherited a
                     fortune upon the death of an unnamed cousin (I:L1:4and note), the decline of Alphonse
                     Frankenstein's friend Beaufort (I:1:2), the sudden demise of Caroline Frankenstein
                     (I:2:2), Victor's nocturnal visits to vaults and charnel houses (I:3:3), his association
                     of his Creature with mummies and ghouls (I:4:4), and the death of Justine's three
                     siblings and mother in this paragraph. The actual context for this narrative should,
                     of course, not be forgotten, an unexplored reach of the Arctic wilderness where the
                     sight of another human being (I:L4:4) provokes "unqualified wonder."</p>

                  <p>Baseless imaginings. Victor has already acknowledged that the claims of Cornelius

                  <p>Johnson also reminds his readers of the origin of the root: "the poetical chimera,
                     a monster feigned to have the head of a lion, the belly of a goat, and the tail of
                     a dragon." </p>

                  <p>An inordinate interest in chivalry, suggestive of an investment in archaic notions
                     of manners and social hierarchy, constitutes the moral defect of Ferdinando Count
                     Falkland in Godwin's Caleb Williams (1794). Here, in contrast, it seems meant to reveal
                     the inherently poetic imagination of Clerval.</p>

                  <p>Whether Mary Shelley, in framing her revisions, intended to give her novel a geographical
                     symmetry by placing an Italian sojourn in the early part of Victor's narrative to
                     balance that of Safie and her father at its absolute center (1831:II:14:12) can be
                     only a matter of conjecture. It is consistent, however, with the strong structural
                     patterning of the novel. By 1831, of course, she might simply have decided to translate
                     her own experience into the rewriting of the novel, for it was certainly the case
                     that she and Percy Bysshe Shelley sought Italy in 1818, just months after the publication
                     of Frankenstein, ostensibly for reasons of health.</p> 
                  <p>One consequence of the considerable emendation made to this first chapter of Victor's
                     narrative is to emphasize how well off his family is. To see the sights of Italy is
                     one thing; to make a leisurely tour of the country, then extend the excursion to take
                     in France and Germany, requires substantial means as well as leisure. In the 1818
                     text the Frankensteins were respected members of their community; by 1831 they have
                     assumed something of the trappings of aristocracy. </p>

                  <p>Victor has already explained that he was by this time running a low fever as a result
                     of his "ardour [burning] that far exceeded moderation" (I:3:9). From this point on
                     in the novel, Victor is never wholly well.</p>

                  <p>Mary Shelley read this anecdote in Washington Irving's Life and Adventures of Christopher
                     Columbus (1828), Book V, Chapter 7, where it is used to applaud the explorer's "practical
                     sagacity." Her light emphasis here on the achievements of great explorers and the
                     uses to which their knowledge is put might be thought to press issues of considerable
                     importance to the novel she is introducing. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e1101"><span class="term">communication</span> 
                  <p>Walton raises for the first time a major concern of the novel, the aims, uses, and
                     potential limitations of writing. Although he affirms the importance here of a human
                     presence that will guarantee unmediated sympathy, still he does so in the form of
                     a written letter that in the previous sentence names his correspondent ("Margaret")
                     and in the sentence to follow strongly links her to him by a charged term of endearment
                     ("my dear sister"). The logic of this letter, indeed, suggests the actual limitations
                     of the unmediated exchange. Although he admires the officers of his ship, for instance,
                     Walton cannot expect their sympathy in the refined emotions he here transmits to his
                     distant sister.</p> 
                  <p>At the same time, Victor Frankenstein's retreat into obsessive study and his Creature's
                     enforced isolation will show the consequences of trying to fall back upon one's own
                     singular resources. That Mary Shelley regards the communication of emotion as fundamental
                     to human need and experience seems implicit in her choice of an epistolary form in
                     which to frame her novel. </p>

                  <p>It seems never to cross Victor's mind that he might not "employ" his discovery or
                     even that he might collaborate with others in its practical application. As the paragraph
                     goes on, it is also clear that the number of options Victor considers for his discovery
                     is very limited. To invoke the terminology of a later day, rather than publishing
                     his discovery, he decides to author it. </p>

                     piece with her concentration on individual responsibility, but it also stresses the
                     element of social coercion that brings about this miscarriage of justice. That Justine
                     will prevaricate in a situation where Victor cannot bring himself to speak the truth
                     once more underscores how relative is the nature of truth in this novel.</p>

                  <p>Early nineteenth-century English anti-Catholic prejudice stressed the hierarchical
                     conformity of the Roman Church as against the individual self-witnessing or examination
                     of conscience that the growing evangelical movement especially emphasized. Yet if
                     this confessor is manipulative and reminds one of that staple of Gothic fiction, the
                     obdurate inquisitor, he seems to stand in contrast to the earlier confessor, who acted
                     as a kindly mender of family fences to convince her mother after the deaths of her
                     other children to take Justine back into her home (I:5:6). Of course, he could be
                     the same priest, only apparently kind in his offices, but essentially superstitious
                     in interpreting God's will and actively supporting firm social structures to curb
                     errant individual desire.</p>

                     several levels suddenly here move to the center in a stark form. Justine, unlike Victor

                     come into general awareness in her time. We now recognize that a paradigm shift had
                     occured in the previous generation, one forcing the "life sciences" into a disciplinary
                     partnership with the physical sciences. From that point forward all notions of distinct
                     animistic or quasi-magical differences separating them disappear. Furthermore, under
                     this conceptual format nineteenth-century scientific inquiry increasingly reduces
                     the processes of life themselves to merely chemical reactions. </p>

                     a world of never-ending process is held up as far preferable to one of known or dogmatic
                     limitation—in the succinct formulation of Wordsworth, "The budding rose above the
                     rose full blown" (The Prelude, XI.121). Here Mary Shelley quietly signals the dangers

                     emotion. Victor quickly displaces it with a new, contemporary, seemingly spontaneous
                     effusion that, being conventionally patriotic, has the virtue of concealing the all-too

                     echo is to a passage whose dynamics will come to dominate the relationship between
                     Victor Frankenstein and his Creature in the novel, an attachment based more and more
                     on passionate revenge.</p>      What though the field be lost?<br/> All is not lost; the unconquerable will,<br/> And study of revenge, immortal hate,<br/> And courage never to submit or yield:<br/> And what is else not to be overcome?<br/> That glory never shall his wrath or might<br/> Extort from me.<br/> -- I.105-111 Later in Book I Satan's vengeful courage is reinforced by Milton:      his

                  <p>This, the second death in as many paragraphs, almost slips by without notice. But
                     surely Walton might have been left a patrimony by his father and thus need not have
                     been granted freedom from financial constraints by the death of a youth whom we may
                     assume was of an age comparable to his. This unexpected source of his independence,
                     means sufficiently ample to allow him to hire a crew and outfit an ocean-going vessel
                     for a lengthy voyage, testifies to the instability of fortune, the constant threat
                     of mortality, and even to how important are extended families in this narration. It
                     also rather foreshadows later events in the novel, since Victor Frankenstein's cousin
                     Elizabeth will also bear the cost of his success.</p>

                  <p>Many other elements that Victor does not mention might restrain such inquiry, from
                     fear of divine retribution to worry over the possible ethical consequences of scientific
                     intervention. Upon a closer look, the reader may wish to recognize an abiding egotism
                     underlying Victor's exclusive concentration on the efficacy of an individual scientist's
                     endeavor, without regard for its extrinsic contexts or its social impact.</p>

                     conventional attributes of early nineteenth-century notions of femininity. However,
                     the emphasis on her "mind" in the previous paragraph (of 1818, excised in 1831) may
                     suggest the tempering influence of Mary Wollstonecraft. </p>

                  <p>In conventional human terms a child is the offspring of two parents. Victor, in absolute

                     as a "creature," a neutral term, but "it" immediately undergoes a process of construction
                     that will continue in a remarkably exact progression over the next two paragraphs.
                     From the very first the "new species" Victor had promised himself in the previous

                     the account to which he now listens (I:L4:31, and note), Mary Shelley reverts to the
                     notion of curiosity as being, for better or worse, a fundamental human trait that
                     impels the actions of all the major characters in the novel. Often, as here, the interest

                     broached in Walton's Letter (I:L1:2) and continued in the opening chapter of Victor's
                     narrative. Late in the novel Walton's curiosity will also function to establish for
                     the first and only time a momentary bridge between Victor's Creature and humanity
                     (III:WC:38).</p>

                  <p>The initial posing of a highly problematic theme of the novel, the thirst for knowledge
                     as an end in itself. The same theme implicates "Alastor," Percy Bysshe Shelley's major
                     poem written in 1815, and published in March of the next year, four months before
                     Mary Shelley conceived the idea for Frankenstein, as well as William Godwin's first
                     great success in fiction, The Adventures of Caleb Williams (1792): whose fourth paragraph
                     begins, "The spring of action which, perhaps more than any other, characterised the
                     whole train of my life, was curiosity."</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e1292"><span class="term">dæmon</span> 
                  <p>This is the term that, as his narrative proceeds into Volume 3, Victor will increasingly
                     use to denominate his Creature. But to have it thus introduced here without any preparation,
                     and in this peculiar period spelling, is to raise a serious question as to what exactly
                     Victor may intend by the term. Walton's interpolation, "as he called him," emphasizes
                     the importance of perspective in any such definition and may even indicate his own
                     lack of assurance about what is meant by Victor's usage.</p> 
                  <p>Samuel Johnson's Dictionary (1755) is uncharacteristically reductive in its definition:</p> 
                  <p>DEMON, n.s. [dæmon, Latin; daimôn.] A spirit; generally an evil spirit; a devil.</p> 
                  <p>The Oxford English Dictionary, in contrast, exhibits the full range and complexity
                     of the word's history. (The examples are here abridged.)</p>DEMON
                  <p>demon 1. Also 6-9 dæmon. In form, and in sense 1 a, a. L. dæmon (med.L. demon) spirit,
                     evil spirit, a. Gr. dai'mwn divinity, genius, tutelary deity. But in sense 1 b and
                     2, put for L. dæmonium, Gr. daimo'nion, neuter of daimo'nioj adj. '(thing) of divine
                     or dæmonic nature or character', which is used by the LXX, N. Test., and Christian
                     writers, for 'evil spirit'. Cf; Fr. dimon (in Oresme 14th c. dimones); also 13th c.
                     demoygne = Pr. demoni, Ital., Sp. demonio, repr. L. dæmonium, Gr. daimo'nion.</p>1.
                  <p>a. In ancient Greek mythology (= dai'mwn): A supernatural being of a nature intermediate
                     between that of gods and men; an inferior divinity, spirit, genius (including the
                     souls or ghosts of deceased persons, esp. deified heroes). Often written dæmon for
                     distinction from sense 2.</p> 
                  <p>b. Sometimes, particularly, An attendant, ministering, or indwelling spirit; a genius.
                     (Chiefly in references to the so-called 'dæmon of Socrates'; Socrates himself claimed
                     to be guided, not by a dai'mwn or dæmon, but by a daimo'nion, divinum quiddam (Cicero),
                     a certain divine principle or agency, an inward monitor or oracle. It was his accusers
                     who represented this as a personal dæmon, and the same was done by the Christian Fathers
                     (under the influence of sense 2), whence the English use of the word, as in the quotations.
                     See tr. Zeller's Socrates iv. 73; Riddell, Apology of Plato, Appendix A.).</p>2. An evil spirit.
                  <p>a. (Representing daimo'nion of the LXX and N.T. (rarely dai'mwn); in Vulgate dæmonium,
                     dæmon). Applied to the idols or gods of the heathen, and to the 'evil' or 'unclean
                     spirits' by which demoniacs were possessed or actuated. A Jewish application of the
                     Greek word, anterior to Christianity. Daimo'nia is used several times by the LXX to
                     render shedim 'lords, idols', and secirim 'hairy ones' (satyrs or he-goats), the latter
                     also rendered ma'taia 'vain things'. It is also frequent in the Apocrypha (esp. in
                     Tobit), and in the N.T., where in one instance (Matt. viii. 31) dai'monej occurs in
                     same sense. In the Vulgate generally rendered dæmonium, pl. -ia, but once in O.T.
                     (Lev. xvii. 7), and in 10 places in N.T. (8 in St. Matthew) dæmon, pl. -es. These
                     words are indiscriminately translated deofol in the Ags. Gospels, feend or deuil in
                     Wyclif, and in all the 16-17th c. versions devil; the Revisers of 1881-5 substitute
                     demons in Deut. and Psalms, but in the N.T. retain devil, -s, in the text, with the
                     literal translation demon, -s, in the margin. Quite distinct from this is the word
                     properly translated 'Devil', dia'boloj, which is not used in the plural. It is owing
                     to this substitution of devil in the Bible versions, that demon is not found so early
                     in this, as in the popular sense b, which arose out of this identification.</p> 
                  <p>b. In general current use: An evil spirit; a malignant being of superhuman nature;
                     a devil.</p> 
                  <p>c. Applied to a person (animal or agency personified), of malignant, cruel, terrible,
                     or destructive nature, or of hideous appearance. (Cf. devil.)</p> 
                  <p>d. fig. An evil passion or agency personified. spec. an alcoholic drink. Also attrib.</p> 
                  <p>e. Applied to a being of superhuman or 'diabolical' energy, skill, etc. (cf. 3 a spec.);
                     also to an action, etc.</p> 
                  <p>Accordingly, although Victor Frankenstein obviously wishes to "demonize" his Creature
                     as a kind of fiend or devil (as in 2b), in both his actual encounters with him, the
                     Creature acts as a kind of conscience in the sense of 1a (II:2:7, III:3:13), reminding
                     him of his duties as a creator. In later chapters of the novel, where a complex doubling
                     effect occurs, it seems at times as if the Creature were, indeed, an inner genius,
                     as in 1b. The Creature does, of course, have the hideous appearance defined in 2c,
                     and he exhibits the extraordinary energy and skill noted in 2e, aspects that remind
                     us that Victor himself fabricated his Creature to be superhuman. This sense of his
                     own responsibility for the Creature's nature is exactly what is canceled by Victor's
                     calling him a demon. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e1325"><span class="term">dæmon</span> 
                  <p>Against the very mundane cruelty of a miscarriage of human justice, Victor seems to
                     feel obliged to inflate the terms as a means of assuaging his guilt. His rhetoric
                     transcendentalizes his Creature, who can thus be conceived as beyond human suffering,
                     as maliciously sporting with life. With a nice irony, the Creature will use exactly
                     the same terms on Victor when they later meet: see II:2:7 and note.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e1332"><span class="term">Dante</span> 
                  <p>In the lower circles of the Inferno, Dante represents sinners grotesquely transfigured
                     by the nature of their sins, as their physical presence imitates the moral condition
                     of their souls. For Victor to invoke Dante in this manner, however, is to remind us
                     that in his medieval Christian universe no one is born damned, but rather must actively
                     estrange the self from God's merciful love in order to embrace damnation as a principle
                     of one's being. Victor also unwittingly raises the disturbing question that will be
                     underscored in the ensuing paragraph: in a world where man plays God, what is the
                     state of damnation and what constitutes hell?</p>

                  <p>This may be a premonition of Victor's own complicity in William's death, or it can
                     be read as one of several instances where we observe on his part a chronic hesitancy
                     to act. This will return in the third volume as a near-paralysis of the will. It is
                     perhaps a natural reaction of one who has pursued one course of action with compulsive
                     energy (see I:3:9) and then finds himself unable to undo or even cope with the result.</p>

                  <p>The theme of dejection is a significant component of "dark" Romanticism. The most
                     influential exploration of it in the canon of British Romanticism is that found in
                     "Dejection: An Ode" by Coleridge, whose "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" has already
                     figured in the structure of the novel (I:L2:6). Of the major Romantic poets (besides
                     Percy Bysshe Shelley), Coleridge seems to have had the greatest impact on Mary Shelley's
                     writing in Frankenstein.</p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e1353"><span class="term">Dr. Darwin</span> 
                  <p>Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802). The reference is almost certainly to his last work, The
                     Temple of Nature; or, the Origin of Society: A Poem, with Philosophical Notes, published
                     posthumously in 1803.</p> 
                  <p>Its cryptic citation in the opening paragraph of the Preface testifies to the major
                     importance of this work for the conceptual structuring of Frankenstein, particularly
                     in the electromagnetic linkage of the scientific concerns of Victor Frankenstein and
                     Robert Walton, as well as for the conspicuous and strange polar setting of the novel.
                     The relevant note is the twelfth in the appendix.</p> 
                  <p>What exactly Percy Bysshe Shelley is referring to in his glancing citation of The
                     Temple of Nature is harder to discern. That he knew the work intimately can be discerned
                     by how much its form, as well as its science, contribute to the underlying conception
                     of Queen Mab (1813) and its two-book redaction published in the Alastor volume in
                     March 1816, "The Daemon of the World." In respect to Frankenstein, he is probably
                     thinking of Darwin's notion of creation as occuring from the dynamic interaction of
                     polar opposites in Book I.227ff, or its extension in the notion of life and death
                     as interacting forces in Book IV.375ff. Likewise, of relevance (though wholly erroneous
                     in its suppositions) is the first of the Additional Notes in the appendix, on "Spontaneous
                     Vitality of Microscopic Animals." Darwin also has a curious exposition of male reproduction
                     in nature without the intercession of females: see Book II, section III, somewhat
                     elaborated in the eighth of the Additional Notes. </p>

                  <p>Although Mary Shelley publishes this revision of her novel pseudonymously, as by "The
                     Author of The Last Man, Perkin Warbeck, &amp;C. &amp;C.," she writes as though she had signed
                     her full name to the title page, speaking familiarly of her husband toward the end
                     of the Introduction as "Shelley" (see I:Intro:7) and here casting her parents, William
                     Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft, as almost legendary, if historical, figures whom she
                     need not bother to name. Constrained to keep the Shelley name out of the press by
                     the meager allowance Sir Timothy Shelley had reluctantly settled upon his grandson,
                     and thus remaining, as her opening paragraph indicates, "very averse to bringing [her]self
                     forward in print" (see I:Intro:1), Mary Shelley nonetheless goes out of her way here
                     to establish her major credentials as an artist and her strong claim to public notice.
                     An appearance of modesty to cloak an unladylike presumption is a standard ploy of
                     women writers at this time.</p>

                     Satan, here Mary Shelley directly echoes his description:</p> 
                  <p>     his face<br/> Deep scars of thunder had intrencht, and care<br/> Sat on his faded cheek, but under brows<br/> Of dauntless courage, and considerate pride<br/> Waiting revenge.<br/> -- I.600-604</p> 
                  <p>The author's purpose seems not to be one of branding this crew with a diabolic association
                     (though it is true that they will later become united in rebellion against their master),
                     but rather this early on in the novel to plant motifs that will serve as unifying
                     structural and thematic devices as Mary Shelley begins to interweave multiple narrative
                     lines. In this case the association of the heroic and the Satanic will provide a perspective
                     in which the reader will later frame both Victor Frankenstein and his Creature. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e1394"><span class="term">day and night</span> 
                  <p>This intellectual obsessiveness links Walton with Frankenstein as he pursues the secret
                     of life (I:3:3, I:3:9).</p>

                  <p>In his earlier letter (I:L1:3 and note) Walton had also singled-out this faculty of
                     imaginative reverie. As there, the tone here is ambiguously self-critical, suggesting
                     something tenuous and escapist about Walton's flights of fancy.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e1408"><span class="term">day dreams</span> 
                  <p>The customary term for such a faculty in literature of the Romantic period is imagination.
                     Yet, the connotations of Walton's diction do not aspire to such a level of import,
                     a "day dream" implying something less substantial than a reverie, which itself signifies
                     a mental state much less imposing than a vision. This implicit deflation of the power
                     or value of the imagination will become a thematic undertone in the novel. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e1415"><span class="term">days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue</span> 
                  <p>This intermixture of day and night recalls the diction with which the chapter opened
                     (I:3:1) as well as Walton's description of his own educational drive (I:L1:3).</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e1422"><span class="term">death-bed</span> 
                  <p>Although there have been several deaths already confronted in the novel—those of Walton's
                     cousin (I:L1:4), of Caroline's father (I:1:5), and of Elizabeth's mother (I:1:7)—this
                     is the first that is not simply reported, but is enacted before the reader. That Caroline's
                     death is a consequence of selfless nurture suggests that this is an expectation of
                     women that is not without danger. Mary Shelley could not have failed to recognize
                     that, in focusing so sharply on the death of Caroline Frankenstein as being brought
                     on by her stepdaughter, she was in some sense rehearsing the death of her own mother
                     Mary Wollstonecraft following her birth. Critics have likewise traced the novel's
                     twin emphases on responsibility and guilt to this crucial biographical detail.</p>

                  <p>In her revisions Mary Shelley seems intent to plant certain elements crucial to the
                     plot very early in its exposition. In this case Victor Frankenstein's resuscitation
                     in the short term is balanced by an awareness of the underlying debility of his physique.
                     Later on, both in his autobiographical account and, afterwards, when Walton resumes
                     the narrative, he will manifest symptoms that a nineteenth-century reader would identify
                     with consumption—that is to say, tuberculosis.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e1443"><span class="term">dejection</span> 
                  <p>The theme of dejection is a significant component of "dark" Romanticism. The most
                     influential exploration of it in the canon of British Romanticism is that found in
                     "Dejection: An Ode" by Coleridge, whose "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" has already
                     figured in the structure of the novel (I:L2:6). Of the major Romantic poets (besides
                     Percy Bysshe Shelley), Coleridge seems to have had the greatest impact on Mary Shelley's
                     writing in Frankenstein.</p>

                  <p>The monstrous is further mystified, not just as a zombie, who has come by black magic
                     into a false and unnatural vitality, but also as a demon, a supernatural embodiment
                     of evil. The progression is thus from the wretched (alienated) to wretch (marginally
                     human) to monster (inhuman) to demon (antihuman). And howsoever the Creature is named
                     or names himself, as he will richly illustrate in the second volume (especially II:5:17
                     and II:7:7), so he becomes.</p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e1458"><span class="term">its departure . . . </span> 
                  <p>The shift in pronouns here (from "its" to "he") is telling but hardly indicative of
                     a sudden sense of human identification between Victor and his Creature. Instead, to
                     denominate the Creature a man allows Victor immediately to fix moral blame upon him.
                     </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e1465"><span class="term">a depraved wretch</span> 
                  <p>The phrasing suggests not just a vile being, as "wretch" was used in I:4:3 and I:4:6,
                     but now also one who is corrupt, wicked. Victor, who has no discernible religious
                     belief or instruction, has wandered into a treacherous theological morass. The Judeo-Christian
                     God has created humanity, in Milton's words, "just and right,/ Sufficient to have
                     stood, though free to fall" (Paradise Lost, III.98-99). Victor, however, as God's
                     stand-in, has no assurance that his Creature is without flaw. Having constructed him
                     from whatever bodily parts he could lay his hands on (and without any particular nicety
                     that they even be human), Victor presumes a correlation between body and soul, both
                     being corrupt. In theological terms, however, such a vision of God as the creator
                     of evil is fundamentally heretical, for it would hold God directly responsible for
                     human depravity. Victor's chain of thoughts does not extend so far as openly to convict
                     himself of the responsibility for the evil he assigns his Creature. Yet, his sudden
                     sense here of their twin relationship does suggest the glimmer of that terrible truth
                     the novel will slowly unfold.</p> 
                  <p>Johnson's 1755 Dictionary represents the verb to deprave with an uncharacteristic
                     lack of discrimination:</p> To vitiate; to corrupt; to contaminate. 
                  <p>The Oxford English Dictionary, on the other hand, registers historical and theological
                     shifts in usage:</p> 
                  <p>depravity An extension of pravity (ad. L. pravitas) previously used in same sense,
                     after deprave and its derivatives. (No corresponding form in Latin or French.) The
                     quality or condition of being depraved or corrupt.</p> 
                  <p>a. Perverted or corrupted quality. Obs.</p> 
                  <p>b. Perversion of the moral faculties; corruption, viciousness, abandoned wickedness.</p> 
                  <p>c. Theol. The innate corruption of human nature due to original sin. Often total depravity:
                     In common use from the time of Jonathan Edwards: the earlier terms were pravity and
                     depravation.</p> 
                  <p>d. A depraved act or practice.</p> 
                  <p>depraved</p> 
                  <p>1. Rendered bad or worse; perverted, vitiated, debased, corrupt. Now chiefly of taste,
                     appetite, and the like.</p>

                  <p>If we revert to the actual chronology of Frankenstein, we realize that it was only
                     the day before that Victor had told Walton that his "fate [was] nearly fulfilled"
                     (I:L4:32 and note), but left the reasons for that assurance totally unarticulated.
                     In the present narration he will slowly begin to explore the range of determinants
                     of his "destiny," starting a few paragraphs earlier by acknowledging that it ought
                     to have been tied to his patriarchal inheritance as a set of understood family obligations
                     (I:1:1), a duty that is here to be set in opposition to a self-absorbed obsession
                     with scientific discovery, which is the evil "genius" he will now delineate. </p>

                  <p>Once again, as in the previous chapter (I:1:15), Victor suggests that the course of
                     his development is not of his own making, but was necessitated by his professional
                     commitment. His linking of his destiny to scientific knowledge has the effect of transferring
                     the systematic logic of the discipline to the random events of his life, an inductive
                     leap that, however much it may lack a rational base, will bear profound consequences.</p>

                  <p>In her revision Mary Shelley seems conscious of the uncanny freight this word carries
                     from beyond the novel. It is, we recall, the first noun we encounter in the fiction,
                     a word uttered by Margaret Saville before Walton's departure from London and repeated
                     by him in writing her (I:L1:1)</p>

                  <p>The first such disciple of Albertus Magnus was his student Thomas Aquinas, who was
                     the greatest medieval systematizer of knowledge in the Aristotelian mode of division
                     and subdivision and by no means a proselytizer for alchemy. Albertus Magnus, it should
                     be noted, was for a time the bishop of Regensburg, the nearest principal medieval
                     city on the Danube to the north of Ingolstadt, the university city to which Victor
                     travels in the next chapter (I:2:8). Though he attributes the choice of university
                     to his parents (I:2:1), perhaps Victor's sense of discipleship to the bishop contributed
                     to his acquiescence.</p>

                  <p>Here Victor is explicit about his dependence on the anatomical theater of the University
                     of Ingolstadt. Although nowhere in Mary Shelley's writings does she refer to her knowledge
                     of the actual university facilities in Ingolstadt, which in the eighteenth century
                     included a state-of-the art anatomy theater and dissecting table, this detail does
                     appear to indicate an awareness of the exact particulars of the institution.</p>

                  <p>Frankenstein's inclusion of distillation among the "processes of which my favourite
                     authors were utterly ignorant" is surprising, for distillation was central to many
                     alchemical processes. The eighteenth century did, however, see a number of important
                     scientific developments involving both distillation and the use of steam, culminating
                     in Watt's steam engine. </p>

                     privileged in English Romanticism: see I:3:7 and I:3:11. Victor's imagination appears
                     to lack restraint, common morality, and the instinct for self-preservation. It even
                     subverts the essential principles of his education, substituting fantasy for reason.</p>

                  <p>Mary Shelley is insinuating an irony whose burden will not be clear to the reader
                     for several chapters. Although the officers and crew of Walton's ship react with instinctive
                     curiosity and sympathy at the sight of what they suppose is another human being, this
                     particular being has never in his existence been the object of either human identification
                     or sympathy.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e1572"><span class="term">divine wanderer</span> 
                  <p>It is hard for a reader not to think that such inflated phrasing was intended by Mary
                     Shelley to be read ironically. Yet even if these terms do call attention to themselves
                     in that way, their context would appear to be complicated, even ambiguous, and thus
                     not simply productive in the reader's mind of a countering deflation. For Mary Shelley
                     the most immediate resonance would be of a work written during the same summer in
                     which Frankenstein was begun, Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, Canto 3. Stanza
                     70 of that poem contrasts the solitary Romantic impulse with the debilitating contentions
                     of society denounced in its opening lines.</p> 
                  <p>There, in a moment, we may plunge our years<br/> In fatal penitence, and in the blight<br/> Of our own soul turn all our blood to tears,<br/> And colour things to come with hues of Night;<br/> The race of life becomes a hopeless flight<br/> To those that walk in darkness: on the sea,<br/> The boldest steer but where their ports invite,<br/> But there are wanderers o'er Eternity<br/> Whose bark drives on and on, and anchor'd ne'er shall be.</p> 
                  <p>This honoring of infinite mental freedom is of a piece with the thrust of major texts
                     of European Romanticism, from Goethe's Faust to Wordsworth's Prelude, and nowhere
                     moreso than in Byron's celebration of the artist's endeavors throughout his mature
                     verse. Byron, however, is well aware—indeed, fashions Childe Harold's Pilgrimage around
                     the supposition—that the rootless searcher for an infinitely receding ideal has an
                     inverse double, which earlier in Canto III he had specifically demarcated, calling
                     his antihero Harold "The wandering outlaw of his own dark mind" (III.20). </p> 
                  <p>As these terms might suggest and as his knowing quotation of Paradise Lost in Stanza
                     70 indicates, Byron is himself deliberately playing against an archetype he would
                     expect his readers immediately to recognize. It is Satan's cohort Belial who ironically
                     pays fulsome tribute to divine wandering, which is to say, the angelic intellectual
                     inquiry he has unknowingly forfeited with his fall:</p> 
                  <p>     for who would lose,<br/> Though full of pain, this intellectual being,<br/> Those thoughts that wander through eternity,<br/> To perish rather, swallowed up and lost<br/> In the wide womb of uncreated Night,<br/> Devoid of sense and motion?<br/> -- II.146-51.</p> 
                  <p>Throughout the second book of his epic Milton plays upon the idea of wandering, equating
                     it with the lost condition of all the Satanic legions. After Satan leaves Hell to
                     scout out the new world, they are depicted as wholly unsettled in their new home:</p> 
                  <p>     the ranged Powers<br/> Disband; and, wandering, each his several way<br/> Pursues, as inclination or sad choice<br/> Leads him perplexed, where he may likeliest find<br/> Truce to his restless thoughts . . .<br/> -- II.522-26</p> 
                  <p>As one group of fallen angels retires into philosophical discussion, they find their
                     once divine assurance replaced by a fundamental uncertainty, expressed as "wandering
                     mazes" of the mind.</p>

                  <p>In the meantime, their epitome Satan, reaching the gates of hell, confronts his daughter
                     Sin and describes himself as on a "wandering quest" (II.830) across space in search
                     of the newly created earth. Then, breaking out of hell and encountering the surrounding
                     realm of Chaos, he again characterizes himself as "Wandering this darksome desert"
                     (II.973). Satan's self-portrait may thus be seen to complete this series of references
                     that connect the "wanderers o'er Eternity" celebrated by Byron and Belial with the
                     darker Byronic avatar, the essentially Satanic "wandering outlaw of his own dark mind."
                     Knowledgeable readers of Paradise Lost (and Mary Shelley proves herself such through
                     out this novel's engagement with that prior text) might want, however, to recall the
                     terms of its very end, where Adam and Eve depart Paradise "with wandering steps and
                     slow" (XII.648), reminding us of how closely implicated in the idea of a fallen universe
                     is the human condition we share with our mythic forebears.</p> 
                  <p>Of course, Mary Shelley's novel can stand on its own independent of such an elaborate
                     literary cross-referencing. When we finally hear from Victor Frankenstein of the vicissitudes
                     and despondency he has experienced in his arctic wanderings (III:7:21), we will have
                     another, more immediately ironic context against which to view Walton's enthusiastic
                     apostrophe to his new friend. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e1664"><span class="term">domestic affections</span> 
                  <p>This phrase carries rich connotations in Mary Shelley's time. The Domestic Affections,
                     for instance, is the title of the first mature volume of poetry by Felicia Hemans
                     (1812), a volume in which she first laid claim to speak as the central female voice
                     of the nineteenth-century bourgeoisie. The mythos of the enclosed domestic space presided
                     over by the "Angel of the House" had a compelling power for the new order that came
                     into place after the defeat of Napoleon. Quietly, in the first two chapters of this
                     novel, Mary Shelley has inscribed it as a nurturing space for the growth of the Frankenstein
                     children and even for their neighbor Henry Clerval. A similar enclosed circle animated
                     by the "domestic affections" will form the nuclear center of the Creature's narrative
                     in the second volume. Much critical literature has concentrated on these seeming ideals,
                     some seeing a counter to the male Romantic quest, some questioning just how far Mary
                     Shelley actually goes in endorsing them. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e1671"><span class="term">the amiableness of domestic affection</span> 
                  <p>Although no reader of Frankenstein, if asked to list its chief concerns, would be
                     likely to narrow the range to the value of domesticity and virtue, we can discern
                     in this emphasis a veiled attempt to steer potential critics away from an attack on
                     the novel's political or religious implications. At the same time, the domestic affections
                     are certainly of import for the novel, yet like many other themes encountered in its
                     progressive development, their value becomes increasingly ambiguous.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e1678"><span class="term">our domestic circle</span> 
                  <p>The repetition of this phrase (I:1:13 and note) calls attention to what would appear
                     an ideal family: close-knit, affectionate, mutually acculturating. Does it do so to
                     establish such an ideal as a retreat from the sublime terrors of the novel? or to
                     suggest that even such a model family could not be protected from ruination? or, with
                     an underlying sense of irony, to stress that for all his nostalgia Victor never inculcated
                     the values he honors as projected by the family? Similar questions surround the other
                     "ideal" domestic scene of the novel, the De Laceys' cottage (II:3:15).</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e1685"><span class="term">our domestic circle</span> 
                  <p>Here Mary Shelley introduces another theme that will continually surface through the
                     course of the novel, what Percy Bysshe Shelley in his preface to the first edition
                     termed "the amiableness of domestic affection" (I:Pref:3). Later, when Victor must
                     confront how far as a student he strayed from bring content in his family circle,
                     he will inveigh against his folly and even link it politically to the imperialistic
                     exploitation of unoffending innocent peoples (I:3:12). As with a number of elements
                     in this novel, however, the further one pursues the central value of the domestic
                     affections in Frankenstein, the more ambivalent appears their representation. For
                     example, there is no small irony in the fact that what makes Victor Frankenstein and
                     Robert Walton interesting as characters and helps to bond their friendship is their
                     inability to find satisfaction within such narrow limits of endeavor. And the same
                     might be said in 1816 for the unsanctioned alliance of Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin
                     and Percy Bysshe Shelley.</p>

                  <p>A prime example of what Blake, in "London," called "mind-forg'd manacles." Victor's
                     emblem for himself reveals at once his sense of isolation, of being enslaved by his
                     obsession, and of being cut off from the natural world. </p>

                     eighteenth century: cf. Mary Wollstonecraft's Vindication, Chapter 12. The oddity
                     of its being here singled out as Elizabeth's concern is that it was not a component
                     of Mary Shelley's Godwinian education. On the other hand, perhaps we are to understand
                     that this is Victor speaking, not Mary Shelley. This, then, could be another aspect
                     of the inherently sexist categorizing in which he engages.</p>

                     The overwrought language of this paragraph, appropriate as it may be to Victor's hysterical
                     condition, is one of the few times in the novel where Mary Shelley indulges in the
                     stock properties of the Gothic. By its melodramatic indulgence it testifies, if only
                     in contrast, to the general stylistic restraint with which Mary Shelley vests her
                     novel.</p>

                  <p>Emphasized here and twice repeated in the succeeding paragraph, the notion of duty
                     will assume a problematic but highly important position throughout Frankenstein. Its
                     characters are repeatedly cited in terms of the obligations for which they are held
                     responsible, and on occasion they even find themselves confronted with a disturbing
                     conflict when multiple duties interact or appear to contradict one another.</p>

                     be conscious that it is a subordinate one. At the same time, the discipline with which
                     she reacts to this family crisis clearly elicits Victor's respect, and with his follows
                     the reader's.</p>

                     Naples. William Frankenstein's sweetheart bears her first name, and this rich banker
                     her second. To some extent Justine Moritz may be modeled on her.</p>

                  <p>Victor has been laid up by his illness for some five to six months and feels himself
                     reborn by the season. In the meantime, his Creature has been through a similarly confining
                     experience and reacts to the arrival of his first spring with a like elation: see
                     II:4:19.</p>

                  <p>Victor's education to this point reveals him to be a strong but indulgent student,

               </li>

                  <p>Mary Shelley is so insistent on this point that she has Walton repeat it to Victor
                     Frankenstein (I:L4:6), whose formal education, by contrast, is extensive. It could
                     be that she is trying to make a point about the primacy of moral education or the
                     essential importance, in a novelistic tradition one associates with Henry Fielding,
                     of a good heart. But it is more likely that she is establishing a perspective by which
                     to engage larger questions concerning the means and ends of education. Victor Frankenstein's
                     Creature is also self-educated and likewise has his identity strongly molded by what
                     he happens to read.</p>

                  <p>Victor's admission of his arbitrarily foolish decision would be almost comic did it
                     not subsume such tragic consequences. In his very hubris over the "creation of a human
                     being," Victor unthinkingly excludes the being from a humanity that is defined by
                     its dependence on shared characteristics, alienating him in advance through a structural
                     flaw of design. For all his preoccupation with the destiny he thinks controls his
                     own life, Victor seems quite unconscious of how wholly his assumption of the role
                     of God will determine the course of this being's existence. </p>

                     could hardly do otherwise in allowing Victor to overstep the known boundaries of science—in
                     this scene she clearly prepares us to understand that the dynamic secret of life Victor
                     will discover is intimately connected to electricity as a "vital fluid." Her use of
                     the term "spark of being" at the point of the Creature's coming into existence (I:4:1)
                     seems intended to follow through on this conceptualization.</p>

                  <p>In the 1831 edition Elizabeth Lavenza's consanguinity with Victor Frankenstein has
                     been removed: she is no longer his cousin. She is also no longer compared by simile
                     to an insect, a bird, and a pet animal. Yet, Mary Shelley does retain the curiously
                     dehumanizing figuration of the first edition by having Victor now compare her to a
                     chamois.</p>

                     a highly uncommon one. More immediately problematic to the reader, however, is the
                     figurative imagery elaborated in this paragraph, which in its comparisons to an insect,
                     a bird, and a pet animal, implicitly dehumanizes Elizabeth. It is possible, though
                     the textual support is equivocal, that Mary Shelley intends this diction to be less
                     laudatory of Elizabeth than self-referential, in terms of his facile sexism, of Victor's
                     character.</p>

                  <p>Mary Shelley underscores the perfect irony of Victor's growing increasingly death-like
                     as he attempts to impart life to a new being. Similarly, in his attempt to liberate
                     that being from death into the freedom of life, he voluntarily commits himself to
                     a prison of his own making.</p>

                  <p>Victor's diction here reflects experiences to which we as readers have yet to become
                     privy, experiences that have forced upon him a psychological condition that conceives
                     of the world in terms of adversarial struggle. This is an example of the shrewd linguistic
                     forecasting that we find everywhere in the early chapters of Mary Shelley's revised
                     1831 text. In this case we are alerted to how much those experiences have warped Victor's
                     notion of reality into a series of antagonistic states. The "palpable enemy," which
                     is here figured in spiritual terms, will become objectified in the Creature that he
                     unleashes upon the world and who becomes dangerous precisely because he is treated
                     as an enemy. </p>

                     then, for us to recognize that Mary Shelley is deliberately evoking not mere instrumentation
                     but rather what we would now call a dynamo to infuse the creature with what she called
                     at the close of the previous paragraph "vital warmth." Since the first successful
                     electric generators were demonstrated only in the 1860s, Mary Shelley's vagueness
                     ("some") reflects her sense that such an engine is a necessary technological development
                     of current scientific knowledge but has not yet been invented. </p>

                  <p>As in Walton's first letter (I:L1:5 and note) this may seem an innocent enough term,
                     but accentuated through repetition here as the last word of Walton's paragraph and
                     set within the context of the other substantives in this sentence, the echo of Satan's
                     first speech in Paradise Lost is unmistakeable.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e1872"><span class="term">He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger</span> 
                  <p>There is no explanation for why Mary Shelley remakes Henry Clerval in so robust an
                     athletic mode, replacing the dreamy, poetical (and Shelleyan) figure of the first
                     edition. Perhaps it is Victor who renders the substitution, mindful of Walton's commitment
                     to "enterprise," a word that, starting with the first sentence of the novel (1831:I:L1:1),
                     he uses six times in his initial letters to his sister (see also 1831:I:L1:5, 1831:I:L2:1,
                     1831:I:L2:3 twice, and 1831:I:L4:20). (A context in Milton's Paradise Lost is noted
                     in the latter.) Admittedly, it requires some stretching of the imagination and the
                     text to force a Satanic context upon Henry Clerval: it may well be that by 1831 the
                     original contextual referents for Mary Shelley have diminished or have been replaced
                     by new emphases, in this case that of masculine heroism—the ardour so repetitiously
                     invoked by her male protagonists. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e1879"><span class="term">scope for his spirit of enterprise</span> 
                  <p>This addition to the 1831 text is prepared for by a similar ambition stressed in Henry's
                     youth (see 1831:I:2:2 and note) and may be generally accounted for by the importance
                     the intervening decade and a half had attached to the growing eastern empire of Great
                     Britain, not just in India but also in Afghanistan, on the edge of the Ottoman empire.
                     It would have not seemed questionable to the author or her readers in 1831 that Henry
                     Clerval would wish to distinguish himself as an imperialist. Mary Shelley would have
                     been well aware that one of her former husband's closest friends, Thomas Love Peacock,
                     though sharing Victor Frankenstein's privileging of the European classical tradition
                     over "oriental" literature, had carved out a career in the East Indian Office, the
                     bureaucracy that oversaw commerce with the imperial East. </p>

                  <p>The seemingly admirable discipline by which Walton defers fulfillment and prepares
                     himself for the challenge of his expedition may take on less favorable connotations
                     once the reader has witnessed the introversion and compulsive self-denial into which
                     Victor Frankenstein throws himself as he pursues his own ambitious project. Furthermore,
                     the phrase itself, though seemingly innocent of allusive force, in the context provided
                     by the diction of the ensuing paragraph takes on a mythological resonance. In the
                     first book of Paradise Lost Satan, upon discovering himself on the floor of hell,

               <li class="item" id="d30e1909"><span class="term">enthusiasm of success</span> 
                  <p>The coupling of "enthusiasm" and "ardent" in this paragraph seems to indicate an intention
                     on Mary Shelley's part to underscore how associated are the two and how problematic
                     they may be in that association. The two notions have already been mentioned in proximity
                     in the previous letter (I:L1:2) and (I:L1:3). They will once again be linked in contiguous
                     paragraphs by Victor Frankenstein, when he recounts the frenzied rush of discovery
                     that accompanied his search for the secret of life (I:3:6 and I:3:8).</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e1916"><span class="term">enthusiasm</span> 
                  <p>Like "ardent curiosity" in the previous paragraph (I:L1:2), "enthusiasm" bears a double
                     sense, both good and bad, throughout the novel. It will be taken over by Victor Frankenstein,
                     who is gripped as a student by what he calls "an almost supernatural enthusiasm" (I:3:3),
                     which he likens to the force of a hurricane (I:3:8). In the retrospect of years and
                     their incumbent disasters he terms it first an enthusiastic frenzy (III:2:21) and,
                     more starkly in the last moments of his existence, an enthusiastic madness (III:WC:28).</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e1923"><span class="term">enthusiasm</span> 
                  <p>As in Walton's first letter (I:L1:3) enthusiasm is a charged word. In this period
                     it was as often a pejorative as an honorific word: fanatics of whatever stripe were
                     said to be enthusiastic. This was particularly true of religious fanatics and self-proclaimed
                     prophets. Such figures claimed to be directly inspired by God, to feel the presence
                     of God within (which is the root meaning of the word in Greek). In an ironic twist
                     on this meaning Mary Shelley presents Victor as a self-styled Ezekiel, wrought up
                     not by a storm sent by God but in a mental hurricane of his own making as he endeavors
                     to usurp the function of the deity.</p> 
                  <p>Johnson's 1755 Dictionary is highly suggestive in its implicit aversion to the idea
                     of enthusiasm, defining it thus:</p> 
                  <p>1. A vain belief of private revelation; a vain confidence of divine favour or communication.<br/> 2. Heat of imagination; violence of passion; confidence of opinion.<br/> 3. Elevation of fancy; exaltation of ideas.</p> 
                  <p>If anything, Johnson is even more severe on the practitioner than on the concept,
                     defining an enthuasist as:</p> 
                  <p>1. One who vainly imagines a private revelation; one who has a vain confidence of
                     his intercourse with God.<br/> 2. One of a hot imagination, or violent passions.<br/> 3. One of elevated fancy, or exalted ideas.</p> 
                  <p>In, as it were, burying his third definition beneath the others, Johnson implies that
                     such exaltation is spurious, ungrounded in reality. His dismissive "hot imagination"
                     might similarly be taken as a synonymn for the "ardour" so conspicuously shared and
                     honored by the protagonists of the novel. Quite clearly, the repeated use of "vain"
                     and "vainly" is intended by Johnson to remind us of their substantive, which is "vanity."

                  <p>Walton's "romantic" instincts, he realizes, are affecting his judgment. His language
                     recalls his earlier self-analysis (I:L2:2), suggesting that what he would need in
                     a friend like Victor Frankenstein is exactly the ability to curb such flights of fancy.
                     In the next paragraph Victor will decide to perform that function, starting in on
                     the narration of his career as a corrective and an admonition.</p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e1958"><span class="term">LETTER</span> 
                  <p>Frankenstein is written in the mode of the epistolary novel, a form popularized in
                     the eighteenth century by Samuel Richardson in his novels Pamela (1741) and Clarissa
                     (1748) and expanded across class and social demarcations by Tobias Smollett in The
                     Expedition of Humphrey Clinker. By the nineteenth century the epistolary form was
                     something of an antique, its dynamics having largely been subsumed by other first-person
                     narrative modes that allowed their authors greater flexibility. Mary Shelley's novel,
                     which overtly advertises its modernity in a subtitle, is curiously, then, the last
                     major example of the form in English fiction. The epistolary mode inherently stresses
                     communication and process, major thematic concerns of the novel, and it accentuates
                     a reliance on a variety of self-conscious narrators who are not easily subject to
                     interrogation by one another nor the reader. Mary Shelley's stress on individual perspective
                     and on its resulting narrative indeterminacy are conspicuous features of her novel.</p> 
                  <p>It is interesting to contemplate the fact that a principal account of William Parry's
                     Arctic expedition of 1819, Letters Written during the Late Voyage of Discovery in
                     the Western Arctic Sea (1821), is also couched in an epistolary form. This might indicate
                     some of the same thematic associations, structurally speaking, that the form held
                     for Mary Shelley, or, more immediately, it could reveal her sudden and striking influence
                     on subsequent travel narratives into inaccessible reaches of the globe. </p>

                  <p>That the inveterate Roman collector of superstitious lore could be thought by Victor
                     to be as useful for the modern student as the man who, perhaps more than any other,
                     stood as the foremost elaborator of Enlightenment natural science suggests that the
                     level of this youth's scientific conceptions has yet to mature. In the next chapter
                     he will embark upon his advanced education as an enthusiastic greenhorn.</p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e1974"><span class="term">Ernest</span> 
                  <p>In revising her novel Mary Shelley totally changed Ernest's state of health but added
                     nothing that would give him a reason for existing in the novel except to carry on
                     the family name in obscurity. In both texts, however, Ernest serves as a foil to the
                     overly abstract and abstracted mind of his brother Victor. As a farmer (1818) or a
                     mercenary keeper of the peace (1831), Ernest's concern would be with the given order
                     of things rather than with what underlies it conceptually. In both texts (but paradoxically
                     more pronounced in the third edition, many years after Byron provided an immediate
                     context for her writing), Ernest bears a striking similarity to the Chamois Hunter
                     of Manfred, which Byron began after the Shelleys' departure in 1816 and is also set
                     in Switzerland. See Act I, scene ii, and Act II, scene i.</p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e1981"><span class="term">Ernest</span> 
                  <p>On March 18th of the year before Elizabeth noted that Ernest was "now nearly sixteen"
                     (I:5:1). At the time of William's death a year and two months later, presumably he
                     is seventeen.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e1988"><span class="term">Ernest</span> 
                  <p>Ernest is at this juncture in his seventeenth year, the same age that Victor was when
                     he left his home to study in Ingolstadt. Although a young man of simple decency, as
                     the subsequent conversation will indicate, he is lacking both the sophistication and
                     the probing intellect of his older brother.</p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e1995"><span class="term">even now she often reminds me of her</span> 
                  <p>This point is reemphasized two paragraphs on. Given the events subsequent to this
                     chapter, one should stress the significance of this statement. Justine Moritz has
                     been so fond of Victor's mother Caroline that she imitates her tones and gestures
                     and to Elizabeth seems like her embodiment. That Victor can remain silent at her persecution
                     will thus be a signal moral failing.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2002"><span class="term">Excellent friend</span> 
                  <p>We will learn the reason for this rhetorical heightening through the vocative case
                     as we move into the next chapter. This is the last serene moment that Victor will
                     experience in his entire existence, but the address to Clerval in the past tense immediately
                     shadows its expression of joy. In retrospect, the reader may consider Victor's happiness
                     during this year as purchased by a willful blindness to the potential consequences
                     of his actions.</p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e2010"><span class="term">to shelter her, as a fair exotic</span> 
                  <p>An exotic Johnson, in his 1755 Dictionary, defines simply as "A foreign plant." In
                     modern parlance it would designate a tropical, or non-hardy, botanical specimen. As
                     the succeeding sentences suggest, Caroline Frankenstein's fragile health, which will
                     lead to her early death, justifies such care. Today's reader is likely to find such
                     language offensive since intrinsically patronizing, but it was a common occurence
                     in the fiction, and the society, of Mary Shelley's day and would have drawn no particular
                     attention to itself. Yet, since gender roles are of continuing significance in the
                     development of the novel, this early emphasis on the traditional frailty of the female
                     physique is noteworthy.</p>

                  <p>Victor's account of his life, we should recall, begins with the pedigree of the male
                     Frankensteins in the public life of the state (I:1:1). In his youth he was clearly
                     inculcated with his obligation to follow in this family tradition. The issue bears
                     as well for Walton's sense of purpose on his expedition (I:L1:2).</p>

                  <p>This strange intensity of gaze seems to combine the fixated obsessiveness in which
                     Victor has passed the previous two years with an ominous foreshadowing of the destiny
                     that he will come to feel has driven him to his destruction.</p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e2031"><span class="term">my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature</span> 
                  <p>Victor is originally described by Walton as having a powerful feeling for nature (I:L4:28),
                     which is certainly not the case here; nor is it, indeed, at many crucial points in
                     his narrative. Although in this novel turning away from nature may be indicative of
                     a moral lapse, it is true that in the present instance Victor is circumventing nature
                     in his creation of another sentient being. Thus, it might be said that his insensitivity
                     to the natural is perfectly in keeping with his commitment to a creative act independent
                     of its limitations.</p>

                  <p>Walton understandably credits Victor's condition to severe exposure; but Victor tends
                     to react with extreme stress to the Creature's presence and more than once falls into
                     a catatonic state: e.g., after the Creature's original escape (I:4:3), after the destruction
                     of the second creature (III:3:24), and after the death of Clerval (III:4:10). This
                     appears to be a psychosomatic corollary to his constitutional introversion.</p>

                  <p>The diction here is deliberately resonant with the conventions of a highly artificial
                     poetry. The "fair enemy" is the lady to whom these seductive verses would be addressed,
                     an "enemy" in the sense that she resists their appeal to abandon herself to the sensuousness
                     they invite. </p>

                     William Lane of the Minerva Press in London, publisher of numerous fictional pot-boilers,
                     for instance, also brought out two-volume sets of fairy tales in 1788 and 1794. Closer
                     to home, Mary Shelley's father, William Godwin, under his psuedonym of Edward Baldwin,
                     in 1805 published a set of Fables Ancient and Modern for very young children that
                     went through numerous editions; and the Juvenile Library, which he ran with his second
                     wife Mary Jane Clairmont, specialized in children's books with useful morality appended.
                     This series published the first English translation of Johann David Wyss's perennial
                     Swiss Family Robinson in 1814. Mary Shelley was thus as a child uniquely conditioned
                     by contemporary notions of children's literature, and she was also encouraged to become
                     a writer at a very young age. The careful noting of Clerval's age (9) when he wrote
                     his fairy tale indicates that Mary Shelley has in mind her own debut at the age of
                     11, in a satirical parody about an Englishman in France, Mounseer Nongtongpaw, that
                     was published in January 1807.</p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e2059"><span class="term">fangs of remorse</span> 
                  <p>With this phrase Mary Shelley insinuates a theme into her novel that will develop
                     exponentially over its course. We recall that Victor expressed "the greatest remorse"
                     for having kept Henry Clerval from his studies during his long illness (I:4:20): that
                     diction, for all its hyperbole, was utterly conventional. Now, Victor is bitten by
                     remorse as by a poisonous viper, and it will poison his system for the rest of his
                     existence. For the later course of this poison where it results in agony, for instance,
                     see the last sentence of III:5:8. This same poison infects the Creature as well, he
                     bitterly admits to Walton (III:WC:37). The contemporary definition of remorse accentuated
                     so painful a condition.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2066"><span class="term">somewhat fastidious</span> 
                  <p>This may appear a surprising choice of diction on Walton's part. Johnson's Dictionary
                     defines the word pejoratively:</p> 
                  <p>Disdainful; squeamish; delicate to a vice; insolently nice.</p> 
                  <p>The Oxford English Dictionary somewhat refines the range of possible meanings:</p> 
                  <p>1. That creates disgust; disagreeable, distasteful, unpleasant, wearisome. Obs.<br/> 2.<br/>    -- a. That feels or is full of disgust; disgusted.<br/>    -- b. Full of pride; disdainful; scornful. Obs.<br/>    -- c. transf. Of things: 'Proud', magnificent.<br/> 3. Easily disgusted, squeamish, over-nice; difficult to please with regard to matters
                     of taste or propriety.</p> 
                  <p>The connotation of Walton's usage indicates that he is using the word in the third
                     sense here, suggestive of a well-educated and highly refined sense of taste.</p> 
                  <p>What may be most interesting about this sentence is what it says about Mary Shelley's
                     values. A woman who has been "tutored and refined by books" is still an uncommon being
                     in eighteenth-century culture, often referred to contemptuously as a "learned lady."
                     Here, in contrast, Margaret Saville is a paragon of judgment and the conduit through
                     which this entire history, with its multiple internal narratives, flows. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2095"><span class="term">fatal impulse</span> 
                  <p>It is probably no accident that Victor employs diction that could also be used to
                     describe a massive jolt of electric current. His Creature will receive such a "fatal
                     impulse" at the beginning of the fourth chapter (I:4:1), when Victor "infuse[s] a
                     spark of being" into its flesh. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2102"><span class="term">fate</span> 
                  <p>Victor uses the term with a wholly different emphasis from that given to it by Walton
                     in the previous paragraph. Walton's wish to "ameliorate his fate" refers to the despondency
                     to which he thinks Victor has been driven by hard, but as yet undiscriminated, circumstances,
                     a despondency that could be alleviated by time and compassion. Victor, on the other
                     hand, as his narrative will begin to underscore, has come to see himself as a destined
                     victim of these circumstances, one who can neither alter them nor their effect on
                     his own condition. The disparity in usage is actually a window into character. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2110"><span class="term">the words of fate</span> 
                  <p>As Victor underscores his sense of being wholly out of control of his destiny, he
                     also suggests that, at least as a student, he had little knowledge of himself. At
                     Ingolstadt he finds himself transformed before his own eyes, without an understanding
                     of how or why this process should have happened. The lack of knowledge, of which he
                     has just complained to Walton, thus extends far beyond the rudiments of science.</p>

                  <p>As earlier at the trial (I:7:11), Victor's egocentricity impels him to assert his
                     prior claim as sufferer, even as he stands in the presence of the condemned innocent.
                     His grounds seem to be that Justine, although surely a victim of injustice, has the
                     integrity of her innocence to depend upon, whereas he, although powerless to alter
                     the verdict, knows the grounds of its falsehood and stands morally self-perjured and
                     divided.</p>

                  <p>God is the final cause, and Mary Shelley would have been well aware that a great many
                     people in England could purport to speak definitively on a subject from which Victor
                     backs skeptically away. Victor is perhaps remembering that Newton in his last years
                     wrote a two-volume commentary on the Book of Revelation, where the final cause, in
                     the conventional teaching of Christianity, is cryptically revealed. The secondary
                     and tertiary grades of causation would be, for example, the rationale behind the laws
                     of the universe enunciated with such clarity by Isaac Newton. An example closer to
                     the fictional point would be to understand why and how the Grand Unified Field operates,
                     since both Victor Frankenstein and Robert Walton have been engaged in trying to fathom
                     isolated aspects of it. See I:L1:2 and note.</p>

                  <p>Mary Shelley here unobtrusively introduces another key concern of the novel, often
                     invoked as "destiny," that broadly affects the self-conception both of individuals
                     and their surrounding social ambience. The concept often operates as a cover for personal
                     irresponsibility. Thus, wherever the word appears, the reader should be alert to the
                     contexts within which it is embedded and to the moral and ideological implications
                     of its employment. </p>

                  <p>The language of necessity here is curious and seems indicative of Victor's almost
                     instinctive recourse to a sense of destiny to absolve himself of guilt. The theological
                     implications of this phrase are as serious as are those of the preceding paragraph,

                     of Victor Frankenstein, and, like that analogy, suggests that the domestic tranquillity
                     over which women conventionally preside is threatened by the sublime overreaching
                     of male ambition.</p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e2191"><span class="term">An open and capacious forehead</span> 
                  <p>It would appear once more that Victor has read and inculcated the wisdom of one of
                     his most celebrated countrymen in the eighteenth century, Johann Kaspar Lavater (1741-1801),
                     whose Physiognomische Fragmente (1775-1778)—translated into English in 1789-1798 as
                     Essays on Physiognomy— purported to show how character could be inferred from facial
                     features and proportions. Here "open" carries moral connotations, indicative of the
                     "frankness of disposition" with which this sentence ends. See I:3:1 and note for an
                     earlier instance where physiognomy appears to enter into his discourse.</p> 
                  <p>Mary Shelley was aware that her own character had been predicted from her infant physiognomy
                     by her father's close friend, the scientist William Nicholson.</p> 
                  <p>Nicholson (1753-1815), from an initial meeting in 1786, became one of William Godwin's
                     closest friends, a major influence on the conception of his Enquiry concerning Political
                     Justice, and his source during more than a quarter-century for up-to-date knowledge
                     in the sciences. He and his wife were among the most attentive of friends during the
                     fatal illness of Mary Wollstonecraft. On the infant Mary Godwin's nineteenth day,
                     Godwin persuaded Nicholson to write a lengthy prediction of his daughter's character
                     based on her physiognomy, according to the system popularized by Lavater.</p> 
                  <p>Nicholson's most important contribution to chemistry was the discovery of the process
                     of electrolysis of water, using the new advances in electricity developed by Alessandro
                     Volta and others. He discovered that the application of electrical currents to water
                     causes the water to break into its component elements, hydrogen and oxygen — the first
                     chemical reaction produced by electricity.</p> 
                  <p>In addition to being a practicing chemist, Nicholson was instrumental in propagating
                     knowledge in the field. His introduction to Natural Philosophy (1781) was widely known.
                     He founded The Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts in 1797, the
                     first scientific journal not under the aegis of a scientific institution. And in 1809,
                     he published the British Encyclopedia; or, Dictionary of arts and sciences. Comprising
                     an accurate and popular view of the present improved state of human knowledge in six
                     volumes, from which the extracts concerning galvanic experimentation in the first
                     decade of the nineteenth century, a process of which he was among the major exponents,
                     are invaluable. This consolidation of the contemporary scientific scene has long been
                     understood to have been instrumental in making Percy Bysshe Shelley "a Newton among
                     poets." What should be equally clear is that the acquaintance of Mary Shelley with
                     this remarkable man, thus begun in infancy, would have amply provided her with a theoretical
                     understanding of the scientific bases on which her novel purports to rest.</p> 
                  <p>As Nicholson's account emphasizes (C. Kegan Paul, William Godwin: His Friends and
                     Contemporaries (London, 1876), pp. 289-90), she, too, possessed a "capacious forehead."

                  <p>This feminine ideal stands in sharp contrast to the masculine pursuit of glory (I:L1:6,
                     I:1:18), and, as marked here, it will continue to resonate through the course of the
                     novel. In some sense the theme has already been signalled in Walton's attendance on
                     the exhausted Victor Frankenstein (I:L4:10).</p>

                  <p>Candor is an important character trait in the novel, and it is to Walton's credit
                     that he so naturally evinces it. His openness will elicit a similar frankness from
                     Victor Frankenstein, who for the first time in his existence will tell his entire
                     story. But that narration, then, raises a serious problem. Not only are there many
                     signs of instability in it, the major one being Victor's wish to revise it even as
                     it goes along (III:WC:4 and note); but his earlier lack of candor with his family
                     and friends is akin to dishonesty, which, if so common a practice throughout his mature
                     life, must raise serious doubts about the truthfulness of the narration that comprises
                     the bulk of this novel.</p>

               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2231"><span class="term">I have no friend</span> 
                  <p>The first embarkation on a major and, to some critics, puzzling feature of this novel,
                     its all but exclusive emphasis on male bonding.</p> 
                  <p>If we consider novels that are contemporary with Frankenstein and have been accorded
                     a similar canonical reputation, we might expect a woman novelist to emphasize the
                     richness of female relationships (for instance, the sisters of Austen's Sense and
                     Sensibility or Pride and Prejudice) and a man (the classic example might be Walter
                     Scott in Ivanhoe) to concentrate on the representation of male competition and loyalties.</p> 
                  <p>Perhaps, however, we are overly conditioned by stereotypes. On the one hand, there
                     is the fact that Frankenstein was published anonymously and was taken by at least
                     one critic, Walter Scott himself, to be the work of a male author (see his review
                     in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine). From this it could be argued that Mary Shelley
                     might have wished to escape the preoccupation with female experience in contemporary
                     "lady novelists." And on the other hand, from a feminist perspective it could likewise
                     be argued that a women might have a very different take on that male competition and
                     loyalty than a man. Inasmuch as masculine terms might be said to define the boundaries
                     of a woman's existence, Mary Shelley might have thought an exclusionary male experience
                     to be a province to which she had every right to demand access. This would have been
                     particularly the case in 1816, after nearly a quarter century of almost continuous
                     warfare in Europe. </p>

                     Victor's narrative in the warm relationship between Alphonse Frankenstein and his
                     wife's father, M. Beaufort, represented in its second paragraph (I:1:2 and note),

                  <p>This sudden elevation of language should not be merely dismissed as a facile rhetorical
                     heightening for effect. What Mary Shelley seems deliberately to be doing here is evoking
                     a succession of elements and emotional states associated with the Sublime in eighteenth-century
                     aesthetic theory. As the Creature in his coming to life is associated with the Sublime,
                     so he is its avatar wherever he appears in the novel, either living within a sublime
                     landscape (e.g. Mont Blanc or northern Siberia) or terrifying the human beings whom
                     he encounters by his extra-human size and countenance.</p>

                  <p>Over the years in which Mary Shelley's novel was transformed into the stuff of legend,
                     much speculation has centered on where she might have encountered the name of her
                     protagonist. Unfortunately, none of the suggestions has moved beyond the level of
                     speculation.</p> 
                  <p>It is conceivable that she heard the name of a ruined castle on the Rhine during the
                     hurried trip that she, her half-sister Claire Clairmont, and Percy Bysshe Shelley
                     took down that river in returning to England from the 1814 trip she memorialized in
                     A History of a Six Weeks' Tour, a trip also quickly replicated in the third volume
                     of Frankenstein (III:1:16). But this is unlikely, since none of the party spoke German,
                     and Mary represents them as being rather standoffish to their fellow passengers during
                     the trip.</p> 
                  <p>Similarly, there is no documentary evidence of a visit to the Frankenstein Castle
                     near Darmstadt. Indeed, had it happened, one would have expected it to have been noted
                     either by P. B. Shelley in the Preface he wrote to the 1818 edition or by Mary Shelley
                     herself in the retrospective history she penned for the Introduction in 1831. What
                     the speculation has proven, however, is that the Frankenstein name is common enough
                     not to have needed an actual prototype. The only real oddity about the family name,
                     and one never broached in the text, is how so Germanic an appellation became attached
                     to a French-speaking family in Switzerland. </p>

                     the family picture collection. In this instance, its purposes are directly contrary
                     and antisocial, providing Victor a protective distance for his furtive experiments.</p>

                  <p>Galvanism is named after the inventor of the electric cell, Luigi Galvani, professor
                     of medicine at the University of Bologna. It specifically refers to the application
                     of an electrical charge to dead tissue, which was usually demonstrated by making the
                     legs of dead frogs move as if with life. Galvani's nephew, Giovanni Aldini (1762-1834),
                     conducted experiments in London recounted in John Aldini, An Account of the Late Improvements
                     in Galvanism, with a series of curious and interesting experiments . . . [and an]

                     at Newgate (London: Cuthell &amp; Martin and John Murray, 1803). In the first canto of
                     Don Juan, written later in the year in which Frankenstein was published (1818), Byron
                     remarks that "This is the age of oddities let loose" (line 1021), and comments on
                     various scientific advances: </p>

                  <p>This is a characteristic of the city of which Mary Shelley was well aware, commenting
                     on it in a letter she included in A History of a Six Weeks' Tour and dated 1 June
                     1816.</p>

                     commonly being assaulted and otherwise abused in being transferred from a prison or
                     jail to the courts of law. Mary Shelley endeavors here to intensify the isolation

                     commences.</p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e2305"><span class="term">Geneva</span> 
                  <p>A city of about thirty thousand at the time of the novel, Geneva had long held an
                     importance in central Europe incommensurate with its relatively modest size. John
                     Calvin, arriving in this quiet city in 1536, transformed it into a center of the Reformation.
                     In 1559, Calvin and Théodore de Bèze founded the University of Geneva to function
                     as a center of Protestant intellectual inquiry. This orientation made a natural linkage
                     between the University of Geneva and Oxford and Cambridge Universities in England
                     that thrived throughout the later Renaissance.</p> 
                  <p>That early sense of kinship the English felt for the Swiss was reinforced during Mary
                     Shelley's age by two factors. One was the invasion of this neutral, unoffending country
                     by the French in 1798, which became a major focus of government propaganda in England
                     and effectively ended all sympathy for the course of the French Revolution by its
                     intellectual elite. The second, and for Mary Shelley a more immediate factor, was
                     the inveterate hostility to Napoleon practiced by the leading citizen of Geneva's
                     small suburb of Coppet, Germaine de Staël, who there surrounded herself with a significant
                     circle of independent and generally democratic thinkers like A. W. Schlegel and J.
                     C. L. Simonde de Sismondi. The daughter of one of the few untouchable supporters of
                     the early revolution, Jacques Necker, who kept France financially afloat during its
                     turbulent transition from monarchy to jacobin directory, Germaine de Staël was banned
                     from France by Napoleon and through her travels enjoyed a pan-European renown. Byron
                     met her in London in 1813, a year before his publisher John Murray brought out her
                     important work On Germany.</p> 
                  <p>The circle surrounding Madame de Staël could be construed as an extension of the earlier
                     source of independent intellectual energy provided by Geneva's most famous citizen
                     in the eightenth century, Jean-Jacques Rousseau. During the 1816 summer, Byron and
                     Shelley undertook a boat tour of the northern shore of Lake Geneva with the particular
                     aim of visiting locations associated with Rousseau and his writings. Although Mary
                     remained behind, she would have shared their enthusiasm for this last great figure
                     of the French Enlightenment. It could not have been absent from her mind that to begin
                     a first-person narrative account, "I am by birth a Genevese" (I:1:1) would automatically
                     remind readers of Rousseau's Confessions, the fourth paragraph of which begins in
                     a similar manner. Rousseau's spirit, indeed, might be said to hover over the entire
                     novel, from its emphasis on a new "noble savage" to its concern with education, particularly
                     in the formation of the Creature, to its antiestablishment political undertones.</p> 
                  <p>With such pronounced associations of relevance in both its past and recent history,
                     Geneva stands as a perfect match for the other great center of the Enlightenment,
                     St. Petersburg. As Chapter 1 issues, so to speak, from the voice of Victor Frankenstein
                     identifying himself with the Swiss city, Letter 1 (I:L1:1) is dated by Robert Walton
                     from the Russian capital. Together these figures and these cities represent the values
                     of the Enlightenment that will be interrogated over and over in the subsequent pages
                     of Mary Shelley's novel. </p>

                  <p>If we can take this tribute at face value, as an honest assessment of the rehabilitation
                     presided over by Henry Clerval, we must then read a tragic irony into Victor's expression
                     here. He has opened himself up once more to the generous humanity he had experienced
                     in his domestic circle, a humanity that might have enveloped his Creature in far different
                     circumstances from those attending his instant rejection at Victor's hands. As with
                     other sentiments in these last paragraphs of the chapter, sentiments predicated on
                     stable norms and humane values, we are given a last opportunity to pretend, or to
                     hope, that these are universal truths before the ensuing catastrophe brings us to
                     our senses.</p>

                     the astute reader to the fact that the author was a woman. Not that a man could not
                     have thought of such phrasing, but it is simply true that we might look far and wide
                     around contemporary novels before finding a man who actually would employ such a term
                     in like circumstances. The fact that Walton prizes "dauntless courage" (I:L2:1) may
                     look like a stereotyped masculinist attitude, but combining it with an emphasis on
                     gentleness of disposition shifts the accent considerably.</p>

                     de Specres, Revenans, Fantômes. . . . Although it seems clear that the French version
                     was what the party amused themselves with, it was translated into English by Sarah
                     Utterson under the title, Tales of the Dead, in 1813.</p>

                  <p>However consonant with heroic endeavor or with an achievement beyond ordinary standards,
                     glory is still a word with masculinist connotations. It is a major component of the
                     complex that, we are told in the first sentence of the novel, Margaret Saville views
                     with such "evil foreboding." Within two sentences the word will become associated
                     with the actual fountain of evil in western myth. Later, we will discover that Victor
                     Frankenstein is exactly similar to Walton in representing himself as pursuing knowledge
                     not for wealth but for glory (I:1:18).</p>

                     Walton's invocation of glory in his initial letter (I:L1) must thus apply to him as

                     testifies to how seriously agitated is Victor Frankenstein. It is secondarily an action
                     traditionally associated with Milton's Satan (e.g., Paradise Lost, VI.340).</p>

                  <p>In her revisions Mary Shelley somewhat mitigates the picture of institutional injustice
                     so starkly presented in the first edition. In particular, she pulls back sharply from
                     her earlier representation of the Church's place in this inhumane structure. The Justine
                     of 1831 becomes much more conventionally pious and more tranquilly submissive to what
                     she conceives to be the will of heaven.</p> 
                  <p>The reasons for this shift in tone may be many and complicated. One obvious one is
                     that England was on the brink of the passage of the Great Reform Bill when her novel
                     was republished in 1831, and the prelude to that sweeping legislation, the repeal
                     of the Corporation and Test Acts in 1828, had opened an era of religious freedom and
                     toleration in which such attacks would have seemed truly of another age and ungenerous,
                     if not intolerant, in and of themselves. </p>

                  <p>William Godwin, 1756-1836, political philosopher and novelist, husband of Mary Wollstonecraft,
                     and father of Mary Shelley.</p> 
                  <p>Godwin's works, including works of political philosophy (most importantly An Enquiry
                     concerning Political Justice) and several novels (including Caleb Williams and St.
                     Leon), advocate intellectual self-development through the rule of reason, personal
                     freedom bordering on political anarchy, the dismantling of inherited institutions,
                     religious liberalism, and disinterested justice.</p> 
                  <p>Political Justice emphasizes the deleterious impact of all systems of government on
                     the ethical and intellectual development of individual human beings. In this systematically
                     argued critique Godwin posits the ultimate perfectibility of mankind if freed from
                     repressive social structures. In his novels Godwin obliquely underscores these same
                     philosophical and social issues, adding to them a continuing gallery of portraits
                     of male figures whose obsessions and self-regard are supported by the patriarchal
                     institutions of modern civilization. Both his philosophical and fictional concerns
                     are, in turn, strongly reflected in the characterization and the events of Frankenstein.

                     before he is rescued by Walton and his crew. In the last chapter of his narration
                     (III:7:5) he accounts himself under the special protection of guiding spirits who
                     guide his vengeance against the Creature.</p> 
                  <p>Coming as it does at the end of this chapter on his formative influence, this strong
                     commitment to a guiding destiny testifies to a belief system through which Victor
                     filters his entire existence, thus in effect rewriting it. Where a reader might wish
                     to observe in Victor's behavior a normal adolescent lethargy or an understandable
                     lack of assurance about the future course of his preparation for adulthood, Victor
                     sees the hand of Providence. </p>

                  <p>In the last paragraph of the preceding entry (I:L4:23), written eight days earlier,
                     Victor had still been a "stranger." Mary Shelley seems deliberately to be marking
                     an intensification of Walton's affection for Victor Frankenstein. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e2432"><span class="term">my want of a guide</span> 
                  <p>In her revisions Mary Shelley strengthens the similarities between Victor Frankenstein
                     and Robert Walton. In this case, although Victor is about to undergo a systematic
                     education, the 1831 text leaves him virtually as lacking in discipline as Walton represented
                     himself to be in writing to his sister (1831:I:L1:2 and note). In the context provided
                     by the terms of Walton's letter, where he remarks how much he needs a friend to help
                     regulate his mind, Victor's lack of a close associate in these early weeks spent almost
                     in solitude is ominous.</p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e2439"><span class="term">I was so guided by a silken cord</span> 
                  <p>Mary Shelley, though an only child, did not grow up like one, since there were four
                     different parental configurations for the five children of the Godwin household. Yet,
                     the venerated memory of her father's approach to her education is surely implicit
                     in this "silken cord" by which Victor, led insensibly on for his own betterment, comes
                     to enjoy his education. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2446"><span class="term">had taken an irresistable hold of my imagination</span> 
                  <p>Once again, Victor yields his will to his passion. But the terms he uses seem to invoke
                     something beyond the question of free will and determinism. Victor at this point recognizes
                     that his imagination, the creative power of fantasy, is driving his pursuit of the
                     unknown, which tends to implicate a faculty ordinarily privileged in British Romanticism.
                     Something of the same order happened four paragraphs earlier, when the imagination
                     was likewise cited (I:3:7).</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2453"><span class="term">but half made up</span> 
                  <p>Given the erudition of her father and her husband, Mary Shelley would have known of
                     Aristophanes' account, in Plato's Symposium, of the origin of love occuring when primitive
                     man was split in two: thereafter one half was always yearning for the completion of
                     the self in the other. (P. B. Shelley was to translate the Symposium in the spring
                     of 1818.) Here she plays against the myth ironically, for, as we will see in the sequel,
                     Victor Frankenstein and his Creature will pursue a course of adversarial antagonism
                     that is as passionately intense as love. It is frequently figured in the imagery of
                     doubling and mirroring.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2460"><span class="term">heart and soul</span> 
                  <p>This is the second time (see also I:3:10) that Victor uses this phrase in the chapter
                     to indicate the totality of his commitment to his program of research.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2467"><span class="term">heartless laughter</span> 
                  <p>Like so much of the diction in this chapter the phrase can be read in two senses:
                     first, as laughter without cause, as though Victor's heart is not in it; second, as
                     a cold, self-obsessed, or unfeeling discharge of nervous energy. Although the first
                     meaning is the natural way to construe the diction, the second remains behind, like
                     a sour aftertaste, to affect our later judgments. It is allied to the intimation of
                     madness expressed by the wildness of Victor's eyes.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2475"><span class="term">heart-rending eloquence</span> 
                  <p>Both Elizabeth and Victor, endeavoring to alter the verdict through a rhetoric that
                     would move the judges' hearts, completely fail in their attempt. Once again, eloquence
                     is placed at the center of the discourse and in a highly problematic light. Why it
                     is so problematic might best be gauged by comparing this work to the major poem that
                     Percy Bysshe Shelley was writing simultaneously with it, The Revolt of Islam. There
                     the heroine Cythna so moves the hearts of her auditors through her eloquent appeals
                     to their common humanity as to foment a radical revolution that overthrows the tyranny
                     that has oppressed them. Although it is a conspicuous feature of Cythna's presence,
                     Canto 8 of that poem is exemplary since it is entirely devoted to this process.</p> 
                  <p>In the Shelleys' household, then, eloquence holds a privileged place as a tool of
                     non-violent political reform. Where it fails so grievously as here, the consequences
                     may be very great. That Mary Shelley is herself aware of this dimension may be inferred
                     from her letter of June 1 1816 where she calmly notes of the French "liberation" of
                     Switzerland in 1798 that all "the magistrates . . . were shot by the populace during
                     that revolution." It may give the reader pause to realize that one of those actual
                     magistrates, were he still himself among the living, would have been Alphonse Frankenstein.

                  <p>As with other of his comments in this passage, readers may sense that what Walton
                     signifies is conceptually broader than what he actually realizes he is saying: thus
                     the value of his comment is more in alerting us to a problematic issue than in giving
                     us a thumbnail sketch that will define Victor Frankenstein forever in our minds. Where
                     Walton sees a praiseworthy self-containment in his friend's comportment, indeed, many
                     critics remark the dangers of Romantic solipsism. In Victor's own account his introversion
                     and obsessiveness will be stressed as character traits that were factors contributing
                     to his downfall.</p>

                     Victor's words make a direct allusion to one of Milton's most famous passages in Paradise
                     Lost, where Satan comes face to face with the responsibility for his own damnation:</p> 
                  <p>Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand?<br/> Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse,<br/> But Heaven's free love dealt equally to all?<br/> Be then his love accursed, since love or hate,<br/> To me alike, it deals eternal woe.<br/> Nay, cursed be thou; since against his thy will<br/> Chose freely what it now so justly rues.<br/> Me miserable! which way shall I fly<br/> Infinite wrath, and infinite despair?<br/> Which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hell. . . . <br/> -- IV.66-75</p>

                     is at least partly drawn as a portrait of an idealized Shelley.</p>

                  <p>Although Victor's jumping to conclusions about the guilt of his Creature indicates
                     how widespread is the temptation to judge without evidence, the fact that Justine
                     has been convicted in the popular mind before her trial even starts introduces a sinister
                     element to the social dimensions of the novel. The class issues that will arise in
                     the trial are highly complicated. The small detail of how the Frankenstein family
                     was circumvented by its own servants, who were the ones to appeal to the magistrates
                     (see I:6:34), is telling in its representation of how widespread has been the process
                     of scapegoating that has eventuated in Justine's arrest. This detail may also suggest
                     that the Frankenstein family has itself attempted to keep faith with Justine and thus,
                     in some sense, may serve to mitigate the reader's own temptation to rush to judgment
                     over the family's complicity in an exercise of injustice.</p>

                     among critics with a biographical orientation, both because of the death of her mother
                     Mary Wollstonecraft after giving birth and because of her adversion to her step-mother

                  <p>Mary Shelley has already used the word "hideous" four times in the Introduction to
                     refer to both the being who was endowed with life in the novel and her own conception,
                     "so very hideous an idea" (I:Intro:1). Here they are explicitly conflated. As this
                     novel of horror is revised, so the Creature that inhabits and terrorizes it is reanimated.</p>

                  <p>However much Mary Shelley may have known about Ingolstadt, she never visited the town
                     and thus probably surmised from her general travels in Switzerland and Germany (or
                     perhaps from her travels down the Rhine two years before in 1814) that it would have
                     had such a steeple. The various towered constructions of Ingolstadt, however, are
                     all built in brick. There is a wooden steeple-like construction atop the Hoheschule
                     (University), but it would not have been visible from afar as a landmark.</p>

                     had been earlier (see I:3:7 and note; I:4:18 and note). But, in fact, the shadow has
                     simply been postponed to the next chapter, where it looms with devastating effect,
                     dispelling all this happiness as being as insubstantial as dreams.</p>

                  <p>The pronoun is pointed, an attempt to shield Mary Shelley from an attack on her as
                     a female novelist. Attenuating this strategy, Percy Bysshe Shelley himself undertook
                     all negotiations for the publication of the novel. The subterfuge worked at least
                     to some extent. Walter Scott, reviewing the novel in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine
                     identified Shelley as the author. Closer to the local scene, the Quarterly, inimical
                     to Godwin, savaged the novel as the production of his daughter. Perhaps, this was
                     exactly why the subterfuge was undertaken in the first place.</p>

                     in the first chapter (I:1:15-I:1:16) here is extended to a neighboring father's shortsighted
                     thwarting of all his son's ambitions. Given Victor's portrayal of Clerval as a poet,
                     it is impossible not to feel the impress of Percy Bysshe Shelley's strained relations
                     with his father in this account.</p>

                     they register such major themes of the novel as the value of domestic affections and
                     of sympathy. Whether they do so to underscore the consolation they offer when all
                     else fails or their inadequacy to assuage a fundamental injustice is the question
                     Mary Shelley carefully leaves up in the air.</p>

                  <p>Human benevolence, or natural goodness (the quality stressed in the revised language

                     Shelley. At the same time, it cannot simply be assumed as a given in Frankenstein,
                     for it is severely tested by the chain of events driving this novel. Even people who
                     are nominally benevolent (Victor is the obvious example), act with questionable ethics.
                     And those who are most committed to the notion of a natural benevolence (Elizabeth,
                     for instance) would be hard pressed to show any evidence for it.</p>

                     Erasmus Darwin, has generally been thought to specify his Temple of Nature, Victor
                     Frankenstein's scientific concern with animal structures might suggest the relevance
                     to the novel as well of Darwin's Zoonomia; or, the Laws of Organic Life, published
                     in two volumes in 1794 and 1796. The first volume, in particular, broadly considers
                     the function of structure throughout the faunal species.</p>

                     Her husband read the manuscript with careful attention, here and there suggesting
                     variations in phrasing that Mary Shelley incorporated into the final form of the novel.
                     As the editor of the facsimile edition concludes, "A reading of the evidence in these
                     Frankenstein Notebooks should make clear that PBS's contributions to Frankenstein
                     were no more than what most publishers' editors have provided new (or old) authors

                  <p>Here in an essential form is the crux of the similarity being subtly drawn between
                     the conditions of Justine and the Creature. Not only has society cast her off as "guilty,"
                     but it has reinforced its verdict by classifying her as alien, beyond a human pale:
                     thus, a "monster." Yet, since individual identity is itself so deeply subject to social
                     construction, to find oneself termed alien is to undergo an immediate process of self-alienation.
                     We will witness the same process as the driving force in the Creature's education
                     as the next volume unfolds. </p>

                  <p>The double entendre falls heavily, since from this point on until the end of his life
                     Victor will be tied to his Creature with unbreakable bonds</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2671"><span class="term">I ardently desired</span> 
                  <p>The desire encapsulated in this phrase will be borne out linguistically when Victor
                     begins his course of instruction in the next chapter. At that point various cognates
                     of "ardor" will echo through the text (I:3:1) and note, also I:3:6). At this early
                     point, however, it is sufficient for the reader to recognize that the very language
                     Victor uses echoes Walton's in his review of the course of his self-education (I:L1:2).</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2678"><span class="term">I began</span> 
                  <p>There are 29 first-person singular pronouns in this paragraph; similarly, there are
                     another 29 first-person pronouns (26 singular) in I:3:3, as well as 25 in I:3:6 (where
                     Victor dissolves his egocentrism in pontificatory admonishment of Walton's ambition),
                     and a full 40 such pronouns in I:3:9. Mary Shelley thus dexterously underscores Victor's
                     total self-involvement in his scientific pursuit.</p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e2686"><span class="term">I confessed, that I might obtain absolution</span> 
                  <p>Justine has confessed in order to procure last rites and entry into heaven after death.
                     Yet, as a false confession cannot truly absolve a sinner, either Mary Shelley's protestant
                     prejudice is showing, revealing a bias against or actual ignorance of Roman Catholic
                     theology, or, more probably, she is quietly deepening her social critique to implicate
                     the immorality of those who, entrusted with the spiritual lives of humanity, sell
                     them out to the advantage of their own authority or of state power. It is also possible
                     that she emphasizes the Catholicism of the Moritz household to mark a subtle prejudice
                     against Justine in the minds of the Frankensteins, who seem to reflect the austere
                     moralistic Protestantism for which Geneva was noted.</p>

                  <p>If Mary Shelley's account of her childhood writing suggests affinities with her characterization
                     of Clerval, the depiction of the Scottish idyll of her adolescence similarly encompasses
                     her portrait of the young Elizabeth Lavenza, particularly her fondness for the "aërial
                     creations of the poets" (see both 1818 (I:1:10) and 1831 (I:2:1) texts, and note).</p>

                  <p>This reticence about the Creature will come to have a self-perpetuating momentum that
                     will cause widespread harm. In the case of Clerval, it would have been as easy for
                     Victor to narrate his story as, later, it is with Walton. His holding-back is obviously
                     an important plot device, but within the fiction itself it appears to reveal a deep,
                     if unarticulated, sense of guilt on his part.</p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e2707"><span class="term">I fear, my friend</span> 
                  <p>Victor's interruption of his story reminds us of its fictive nature and reintroduces
                     the problem of belief that will in numerous ways dominate the final pages of this
                     first volume. It also quietly prepares us for a major shift in the plot. In terms
                     of the novel's characterization, however, it might be read as Victor's way of reasserting
                     an urbane control over a narration (as well as a narrator) evidencing signs of dangerous
                     instability.</p>

                  <p>We have already witnessed this physical manifestation of deep psychological conflict
                     in the cabin of Walton's ship, when Victor is first recovering from exposure to the
                     arctic elements (I:L4:10). A grieving Victor gnashes his teeth at the mere thought
                     of the Creature in II:1:6. When we next observe the phenomenon, it will be the Creature
                     who gnashes his teeth in response to the frustration of all his hopes (III:3:13 and
                     note). The prototype for this act is the Satan of Paradise Lost: compare VI.340.</p>

                  <p>Even at this remove from the trial Victor unthinkingly puts his own claims to the
                     fore, reminding us of his skill as a story-teller at the expense of Justine's claims
                     as a victim of injustice. We cannnot forget that her very lack of eloquence has contributed
                     to her victimization.</p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e2735"><span class="term">I lived principally in the country as a girl</span> 
                  <p>For whatever reason of self-presentation or nostalgia, Mary Shelley here magnifies
                     her love of and accessibility to an untrammelled natural environment. Her Scottish
                     experiences occupied less than two years of her early adolescence. Prior to that time
                     she was brought up in Somers Town, in that day located on the edge of the London metropolis,
                     where she could divide her interests between the countryside to the north, upon which
                     her father's house looked out, and the attractions of the city. Godwin's house itself
                     was anything but rural, maintaining an intensely urban and intellectually sophisticated
                     ambience throughout Mary Shelley's youth. There, as a child, she came into contact
                     with dozens of the principal luminaries of British culture at the beginning of the
                     nineteenth century. One of these was Samuel Taylor, whom she heard recite "The Rime
                     of the Ancient Mariner," a poem of particular resonance for Frankenstein, where it
                     is quoted twice—(see I:L2:6 and I:4:7)—and frequently functions allusively.</p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e2742"><span class="term">I loved with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds</span> 
                  <p>This reticence is exactly what friendship is intended to transcend, if we take Walton's
                     notion of its value as a benchmark. He looks to an ideal friend "to regulate [his]
                     mind" (I:L2:2). Even Victor, in the revised text, conceives the value of a friend
                     as being "to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures" (I:L4:23). Victor's reserve,
                     however, negates this function of friendship, suggesting a limit to how far it is
                     able to surmount the barriers of what a later time might call ego-defences.</p>

                  <p>As in I:4:15 and note, Victor's imagination produces not a visionary paradise, but

               <li class="item" id="d30e2756"><span class="term">a succession of imaginary incidents</span> 
                  <p>Mary Shelley's language here is resonant with the terms by which she describes the
                     educational milieu within the Frankenstein circle. Thus, it cannot be accidental that
                     she draws an implicit comparison between her own youthful career as a writer and that
                     of her most imaginative character, Henry Clerval, who is described as smitten with
                     a world of romance in both the 1818 (I:1:11) and 1831 (I:2:2) editions of the novel.</p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e2764"><span class="term">My imagination, unbidden, possessed and guided me</span> 
                  <p>With an uncanny artistry that must be considered deliberate, in this and the next
                     paragraph Mary Shelley internalizes within her own writing the imaginative process
                     by which Victor Frankenstein is first swept along by his scientific advances ("my
                     imagination was too much exalted," I:3:7 and note), then becomes concerned by their
                     obsessiveness ("[it] had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination," I:3:11 and
                     note), and finally finds himself haunted by his own terrifying creation ("I imagined
                     that the monster seized me," I:4:15). Throughout the novel, although the power of
                     the human imagination is universally underscored, its uses or effects are as much
                     deeply questioned as they are celebrated.</p> 
                  <p>In her introduction Mary Shelley appears to be purposefully collapsing the customary
                     distinction between the curiosity of the scientist and the creative afflatus of the
                     writer, a design we see carried out as well in the novel itself. Following these introductory
                     materials, we will turn immediately, as yet a third example of the same elemental
                     process, to the imaginative enthusiasm with which Robert Walton foresees his polar
                     explorations (I:L1:2). </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e2773"><span class="term">a point of view to the imagination</span> 
                  <p>This diction, like the subtitle and the epigraph, is meant to drape Frankenstein with
                     a seriousness of purpose not customary among popular gothic novels. To students of
                     British Romanticism, it is language that is characteristic of Percy Bysshe Shelley's
                     own practices in the prefatory matter to his poems. He frequently accentuates his
                     attempt to transcend through imaginative means the normative, or "ordinary," thoughts
                     and passions of humanity. See, for example, the first paragraph of the Preface to
                     "Alastor" (published in March 1816) or his explanation of the use of dramatic imagery
                     in the Preface to The Cenci (1820). The reader will discover that the uses of the
                     imagination are likewise to become a recurring theme in the novel.</p>

                  <p>Beaufort's introverted withdrawal is of a type similar to further and more conspicuous
                     examples we will encounter later in the text. It may well be that Victor Frankenstein
                     is himself too implicated in this sort of response to notice the parallels, but the
                     more objective reader is here being alerted to another of the thematic concerns the
                     novel will develop.</p>

                  <p>Mary Shelley's point seems to be that, whatever Victor's enthusiasm for the sciences,
                     at this point in his adolescent education he knows nothing of the modern state of
                     chemistry and has little motivation on his own to learn more.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2794"><span class="term">increase of misery</span> 
                  <p>Although the discussion may seem to have moved far from the structural center of the
                     novel, the resonance of this phrase reminds us of the glorious ambitions driving both
                     Walton and Victor Frankenstein and of how Victor's aspiration that "many happy and
                     excellent natures would owe their being to" him (I:3:8) has been disastrously subverted
                     into a murder and miscarriage of justice implicating both his Creature and himself.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2801"><span class="term">indeed every human being</span> 
                  <p>Victor here openly deprives the Creature of a human essence and thus of the requirements
                     of human sympathy. In other words, even as he upholds Justine's innocence against
                     a legal system that indicts her on circumstantial evidence, he himself embodies the
                     fundamental principles of a dehumanized injustice against which he will inveigh.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2808"><span class="term">inexorable fate</span> 
                  <p>As at other key points in the revision of the novel, Victor's inflation of rhetoric
                     as he invokes fate calls attention at once to his self-pity and his sense that he
                     lacked any options that could have altered his destiny. As we turn to the second of
                     the three parts of Frankenstein, that conclusion will be seriously interrogated.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2815"><span class="term">Ingolstadt</span> 
                  <p>Ingolstadt, Germany, lies on the Danube and Schutter Rivers, 45 miles north of Munich
                     and 30 miles south of Regensburg.</p> 
                  <p>Records of this cultural and commercial center of Bavaria go back to the beginning
                     of the 9th century C.E. The city is surrounded by fourteenth-century walls, and is
                     distinguished by a ducal castle (1420), the Cathedral of Our Lady (1425-1500), the
                     Church of Maria de Victoria (1732-36). For centuries it was the seat of the Dukes
                     of Bavaria, who transferred to Munich only in 1800, leaving Ingolstadt a relatively
                     small provincial city (current population c. 90,000). The brief account in the 4th
                     edition of the Encyclopaedia Brittanica (1797), written before this event and roughly
                     contemporary with the timeframe of the novel, gives no hint of the town's impending
                     displacement.</p> 
                  <p>A university was founded there in 1472, although it was moved to Landshut in 1800
                     and then to Munich in 1826. At the height of its importance in the Renaissance the
                     city and the university were a stronghold of Counter-Reformation orthodoxy.</p> 
                  <p>In the eighteenth century an intellectual fervor of an opposite sort was centered
                     there, when a secret society, an offspin of the Masons self-styled the Illuminati,
                     was formed in Ingolstadt to consider the means to a revolutionary reconstruction of
                     European society. Although their actual effect was small, they constituted an easy
                     target for reactionary agitators who traced the debacle of the French Revolution to
                     this improbable source. The main purveyors of this reactionary propaganda were John
                     Playfair's Proofs of a Conspiracy Against All the Religions and Governments of Europe
                     (1797) and the Abbé Augustin Barruel's Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire du Jacobinisme
                     (1797). The latter volume was read by both Mary and Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1814-1815.</p> 
                  <p>These and other similar works were the basis for a novel, with a long episode set
                     in Bavaria and drawing upon the secret society of Illuminati, written by Thomas Jefferson
                     Hogg, Shelley's roommate at Oxford, Memoirs of Prince Alexy Haimatoff (1813). Shelley
                     wrote the notice of the novel that appeared in the Critical Review in December 1814.
                     It is thus impossible for Mary not to have been well aware of the political contexts
                     in which she inserts her youthful protagonist.</p>

                  <p>To disobey such an injunction, with its almost institutionalized cultural sanction,

                     his blind father—on other narrative levels of the novel, as well as other, much greater
                     transgressions for the sake of knowledge. The fact that Walton is orphaned at a young
                     age introduces yet another common theme of the novel.</p>

                     theme among the first generation of English Romantic poets (particularly Coleridge
                     and Wordsworth) and has been much discussed by critics (see, for example, M. H. Abrams,
                     "The Correspondent Breeze: A Romantic Metaphor"). Closer to home, the same correspondence
                     will become the motivating force in Percy Bysshe Shelley's "Ode to the West Wind"
                     in 1819. </p>

                  <p>This phrase is inserted in so unobtrusive a manner as to pass almost without a reader's
                     comprehension of its drift. The unmistakeable suggestion, however, is that the course
                     of Victor's and his family's lives might have been altered if he and Clerval had been
                     candid about the depth and cause of his illness. Yet, Clerval is at no fault, since
                     he, too, is kept in the dark. Only Victor at this point could alter the narrative
                     logic he has set in motion: among its other aspects, his illness constitutes a deep
                     refuge from both reality and his responsibility for its nature.</p>

                  <p>As with many of her interpolations in 1831, Mary Shelley here seems intent on an early
                     establishment of a pattern that will reappear and become more intense in its significance
                     as the novel progresses. Such psychological turmoil will produce a state of nightmare
                     and half-sleep on the night after the Creature is created (I:5:3) and will reveal
                     itself in Volumes 2 and 3 by a chronic and, in the end, debilitating fever.</p>

                  <p>This is the second close male friendship in as many lines (see the note to "friend").
                     Since friendships reflect character in this novel, the intimacy Alphonse Frankenstein
                     feels for Beaufort (I:1:2) and the elder Clerval (I:2:5), both of whom share a sternness
                     of resolve and a narrow preoccupation with business success, may suggest a comparable
                     rigidity, or at least a stiffness and lack of flexibility, in Victor's father. Victor
                     will himself shortly note these traits in respect to how his father oversees his development
                     (I:1:16). </p>

                  <p>Beginning here, Victor portrays himself as having an instinctive interest in science
                     that will drive his entire existence, particularly once he arrives within a university
                     setting and can devote himself to scientific investigation (I:3:1). </p>

                  <p>Simple etiquette might dictate Victor's withdrawal, so as not to intrude his relatively
                     unfamiliar presence on Justine's heart-felt conversation with her friend Elizabeth.
                     Still, his active attempt to distance himself seems as characteristic of his personality
                     as is the egotism that enfuses his private meditation. </p>

                  <p>Victor's highly conscious sense of the effect of his narrative, from now on, will
                     become a continuing motif (see also, for instance, I:3:13). That he is self-conscious
                     as an artist may be thought a normal attribute of Romantic texts. But Mary Shelley
                     may have a more specific object in mind that that of fitting smoothly into her culture's
                     expectations. Victor's conscious manipulation of his reader (Walton and, beyond Walton,
                     us) continually intrudes on the supposition of its truth. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2909"><span class="term">I see them still</span> 
                  <p>What is it Mary Shelley sees? The plural suggests that the antecedent is "realities."
                     But the realities she remarks are those of Victor's bedchamber as well as her own.
                     Like hers it is described as barely illuminated "by the dim and yellow light of the
                     moon, as it forced its way through the window-shutters" (see I:4:3). As in the previous
                     paragraph, the novelist seems deliberately to conflate her experiences with those
                     of her fictional protagonist. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2916"><span class="term">an Italian gentleman</span> 
                  <p>The shadowy presence of Italy behind this narrative has not been explained. It may
                     reflect discussions about moving there that Mary and Percy Shelley were having while
                     she was writing the novel: shortly after its publication they did, indeed, emigrate
                     to Italy. On a less personal note, however, the presence of Italy does extend the
                     geographical bounds of the pan-European setting to the south, just as the opening
                     in Russia extends them far to the north. Safie, it should be noted, also travels north
                     from Italy (Leghorn-Livorno), to the De Lacey's cottage in Germany, but without male
                     protection (II:6:19). </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e2923"><span class="term">It was on a dreary night of November</span> 
                  <p>This was the first line Mary Shelley wrote in the composition of the novel, according
                     to the account she gave of its gestation in the preface of 1831 (I:Intro:13). Everything
                     earlier in its exposition was added later. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2931"><span class="term">It was on a dreary night in November</span> 
                  <p>This is the opening of the fourth chapter (I:4:1) in the original edition, which lends
                     weight to one's sense that what Mary Shelley describes as her "waking dream" bridges
                     the room in which she conceived her horror story with the bedroom in which Victor
                     encounters his living Creature in terror. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2938"><span class="term">I was a wretch</span> 
                  <p>The connotations of wretchedness for Victor are markedly different than they are for
                     Justine, who has similarly called herself a wretch five paragraphs earlier (I:7:29).
                     </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2945"><span class="term">I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay, and forced</span> 
                  <p>Victor's choice of language—passive verbs—suggests once again that he believes (or
                     hopes to convince Walton) that some force other than his own volition guides his investigation.
                     </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2952"><span class="term">I was now alone</span> 
                  <p>A sentence with an ominous sound, resonating throughout the novel, back to Walton's
                     sense of isolation in Archangel, (I:L2:2), his ice-bound ship (I:L4:2), the discovery
                     of Victor marooned on an ice-floe (I:L4:6 and note) and to the enforced isolation
                     in which his Creature is forced to pass his entire existence (II:3:1 and II:8:4).
                     Of particular weight in this diction is its reflection of famous lines in Coleridge's
                     "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" to which Walton has already referred suggestively. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2959"><span class="term">I wept like a child</span> 
                  <p>Victor's account of himself in these paragraphs testifies to a person on the brink
                     of becoming unhinged—almost paralyzed, needing two days at Lausanne to recover a sense
                     of purpose, invoking his native landscape in effusive tears. Such immature behavior
                     could be a sign of the fears he has repressed for a year and a half, and certainly
                     for the reader their emotional heightening portends some new disaster about to reveal
                     itself. At the same time, if we wish to assume that this is a novel with pretensions
                     to being realistic, and not merely gothic in its representation, we might wish here
                     to turn our attention from the ominous to the psychological. These are all symptoms
                     of a personality that has barely survived its breakdown. The year of convalesence
                     has offered tranquillity, but does not appear to have altered the essential trauma
                     Victor has suffered in the Creature's birth. Throughout the rest of the novel, Mary
                     Shelley adroitly poises her protagonist on the edge of madness, and the readers of
                     his behavior (a class that should include Walton as well as us) can never be quite
                     sure on what side of the line he stands. </p>

                  <p>In the courtroom (I:7:7) Justine had surmised that she had no enemies on earth. After
                     a verdict that is untrue to her character and her actions, she sees nothing but enemies
                     around her. The norms of her world are now wholly upended. The diction accentuates
                     the extent to which the social constructions upon which we depend for our well-being
                     are arbitrary and at the same time fragile. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e2973"><span class="term">through his interest he might become a judge</span> 
                  <p>This inconspicuous detail seems carefully planted by Mary Shelley to reveal how closely
                     tied-in Alphonse Frankenstein is to what will soon reveal itself to be a corrupt system
                     of justice in Geneva. It also subtly suggests how the governing elite in the patriarchal
                     Genevan society protects itself, a situation already alluded to at the beginning (I:1:1)
                     of Victor's narrative. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2980"><span class="term">June</span> 
                  <p>The summer months will allow Walton to proceed north with expedition under the midnight
                     sun and with less fear of obstruction by ice masses than might be the case at an earlier
                     point in the year. As we are soon aware, however, if Walton in his romantic enthusiasm
                     hopes for easy passage he has radically miscalculated the treacherous conditions of
                     the Arctic. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2987"><span class="term">a sense of justice</span> 
                  <p>We are to recall that the Frankenstein family tradition has been to enter into public
                     service, most particularly acting in the capacity of syndics, or magistrates (I:1:1).
                     Thus Alphonse Frankenstein's sense of rectitude may be advanced here as a standard
                     whereby to measure that of his son, also that of his society. At the same time, as
                     a man who is so completely bound by the system he has served that he cannot conceive
                     that it might act wrongly, or who is so unprepared to recognize injustice as a potential
                     outcome of the weighing of purely circumstantial evidence, Alphonse Frankenstein,
                     the representative citizen of Geneva, may have so narrow a perspective on truth that,
                     even were it to appear self-evident, it might still never be wholly just. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e2994"><span class="term">the justice of our judges</span> 
                  <p>Alphonse Frankenstein's complacency stems from his sense of a professional brotherhood
                     with these men, for, it must be remembered from the beginning (I:1:1) of Victor's
                     narrative, that Alphonse too has sat in the syndic's chair, as had his ancestors before
                     him. Mary Shelley stresses not only the tight-knit patriarchy of Genevan society,
                     but also, more narrowly, the ease with which the system can implicate all its members
                     in an act of injustice, even when, as is the case with the Frankenstein family, they
                     are convinced of the innocence of the accused. </p>

                  <p>As Caroline Frankenstein contracted scarlet fever from tending Elizabeth, so it would
                     appear that Justine contracted it from her but because of her youth survived. The
                     selflessless of feminine minstration is quietly underscored. So is the general vulnerablity
                     of human beings, which should remind the reader that it is this susceptibility to
                     disease and dissolution that Victor had sought through his researches to ameliorate.

                     in the novel. That it should contain a scene of feminine sympathy is understandable,
                     but that it should be a record of death would seem to underscore the haunted character

                  <p>In explicitly linking in the same sentence the idea of knowledge with a serpent's
                     venom, Mary Shelley seems to be continuing her allusion to Milton's Paradise Lost
                     evident in the preceding paragraph. This intertextuality reminds the reader that knowledge
                     can have psychological and spiritual consequences as well as technical ones, also
                     that human beings are required to assume responsibility for the results of their intellectual
                     labors. Both of these are issues of major import for Frankenstein. </p>

                     model of pedagogy (I:1:21, and note), Krempe relies on authoritarian methods that
                     alienate a student rather accustomed to being indulged. </p>

                  <p>Percy Bysshe Shelley, feigning the author's being abroad, handled the negotiations
                     for a contract to publish Frankenstein, thus preserving Mary Shelley's anonymity.
                     That he first sought out John Murray, Byron's publisher, may indicate that Byron himself
                     suggested such an avenue to the Shelleys. Whatever the case, Murray declined the manuscript,
                     upon whose refusal Shelley reverted to his own publisher Charles Ollier. When Ollier,
                     too, declined to accept the book, the Shelleys were in something of a quandary. They
                     resolved it by turning to a publishing house—Lackington's—that had a large inventory
                     and specialized somewhat in sensational materials. In the two-page advertisement sheet
                     accompanying the novel when it was published in 1818 are representative works that
                     the Lackington firm apparently thought might interest the reader of the novel: these
                     include Francis Barrett, The Magus; or Celestial Intelligences; a complete System
                     of Occult Philosophy, being a Summary of all the best Writers on the subjects of Magic,
                     Alchymy, Magnetism, the Cabala &amp;c. (1801); Francis Barrett, Lives of the Alchemystical

                     Taylor, Apparitions; or, the Mystery of Ghosts, Hobgoblins, and Haunted House (1814);
                     John Toland, A Critical History of the Celtic Religion and Learning; containing an
                     account of the Druids (1815); and—though officially published by another house, White,

                     served as pretext for the ghost-story contest from which Frankenstein eventually came

                  <p>Today, Switzerland and Italy share access to Lake Como as they do to the larger Lago
                     Maggiore somewhat to its west. The Shelleys and Claire Clairmont stopped at Lake Como
                     in the spring of 1818 and, they claimed, would have settled there had they been able
                     to find suitable lodgings. In the event, their fortunes led them further south, and
                     Mary Shelley herself was not to return to the fabled beauty of these surroundings
                     until well after the revised edition of Frankenstein was published. She obviously
                     returned there frequently in her imagination. It is on Lake Como that the small remnant
                     of survivors for a time is able to reestablish a human community in The Last Man,
                     her novel of 1826. Years later, her lengthy sojourn in the vicinity of Lake Como during
                     the summer of 1840 is lovingly recorded in her Rambles in Germany and Italy published
                     in 1844. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e3087"><span class="term">acquainted with more languages</span> 
                  <p>Walton's inability to speak other languages would presumably magnify his sense of
                     isolation after almost four months in Russia. Generally speaking, in this pan-European
                     novel Mary Shelley conveniently allows her characters, wherever they come from or
                     are educated, to communicate freely across national borders. The exception is the
                     Arab Safie, who must be taught by the De Laceys to speak their language. Since the
                     book chosen for that end is Volney's Les Ruines, ou meditations sur les revolutions
                     des empires (II:5:14), she and the Creature who secretly participates in her lessons
                     are educated in French. French is likewise the language of the Frankenstein household,
                     but Victor, in I:1:12, recounts his education in Latin, Greek, English and German:
                     he receives his scientific education in German, in the heart of Bavaria at Ingolstadt,
                     and is adept enough in English to negotiate his way around Scotland and the Orkney
                     Islands. While in prison there his delirious ravings revert to French, which only
                     Mr. Kirwin the magistrate is able to understand (III:4:11). When he hails Walton,
                     the mariner will tell his sister in I:L4:7, Victor does so in English "although with
                     a foreign accent." By the time the Creature and Walton meet one another, however,
                     Mary Shelley finesses her otherwise careful observation of linguistic difference in
                     favor of an unimpeded confrontation; yet Victor's concern that his narration be faithfully
                     recorded (III:WC:4) and his warning that the Creature's eloquence should be distrusted
                     (III:7:25) emphasize radical instability and the problematic of translation as inherent
                     in language. </p>

                  <p>As she does with chemistry, Mary Shelley focuses on an arena of major intellectual
                     development in her age. At the time she was writing, the rudiments of linguistic understanding
                     of what we call the Indo-European language group were coming into place but had yet
                     not been fully recognized and proclaimed as such. Thus, in his area of interest Henry,
                     the poet, should be recognized to be as intellectually ambitious as Victor, the scientist.

                     were denied such access to Latin. We recall that French is the operating language
                     of the Frankenstein household (as it is of Geneva). Obviously, English is here singled
                     out in order to justify Victor's narration as being conducted wholly in English. At
                     what point the German in which he is taught at Ingolstadt enters his educational program
                     is left unmentioned, but by the age of seventeen he will be fluent in it (I:1:26).
                     No note is made of whether Elizabeth retained a residual Italian from having spent
                     her early years in that environment. </p>

                     the exception of German, by this time in her life so could Mary Shelley. Within the
                     fictional ambience itself, the reader can imagine how rekindled, in listening to this
                     account, would have been Walton's retrospective guilt over his undereducated, undirected

                     of discovering the root laws of life. As the complicated mix of his character begins
                     to take shape, Mary Shelley stresses from the outset that Victor Frankenstein is motivated
                     not by greed but by a pure impulse of scientific discovery. </p>

                     Vaud canton and an ancient cultural center to rival Geneva, located some fifty miles
                     away. Built on the Jorat hills, the city offers a prospect of the entire Lake, as
                     well as of the Alps to the south beyond it.</p> 
                  <p>It was conquered by the Protestant Reformers the Bernese in the sixteenth century.
                     In 1798, however, Lausanne fell to Napoleon, who made the city the capital of the
                     Vaud canton of the new Helvetic Republic in 1803. Its pre-Napoleonic political structure
                     is described in the 4th edition of the Encyclopaedia Brittanica (1797). For a time
                     in the eighteenth century, Lausanne was home to Voltaire, Rousseau, and Edward Gibbon
                     (who wrote most of his Decline and Fall there).</p> 
                  <p>Percy Bysshe Shelley recounts the associations of Lausanne with Gibbon in the third

                     mind," in I:3:12. Here, one senses that the emphasis is less on social or antisocial
                     behavior than on what an individual human being has the right to do: "devices" implies
                     a means by which actions are performed. </p>

                  <p>Walton's polar exploration, with its concern for the secret of magnetism (I:L1:2),
                     and Victor's experiments with electricity (I:1:23) as vital fluid intersect with one
                     of the most exciting scientific breakthroughs of the later eighteenth and early nineteenth
                     centuries. Although Erasmus Darwin's scientific take on the linkage—that it is somehow
                     to be explained by basic chemistry rather than the mechanics of physics—is wrong,
                     what impels it is not. Indeed, though it is pedestrian in manner, the lengthy twelfth
                     note to The Temple of Nature is nothing short of visionary. There Darwin first extensively
                     expounds the dynamics of electricity, then turns to the similar processes of magnetism,
                     bifurcated figuratively between arctic and antarctic poles, and in the end links the
                     two with a rudimentary conception of atomic physics (only to be expounded by John
                     Dalton in the decade after Darwin's death), and with the third component of the Grand
                     Unified Field Theory, gravitation. That Mary Shelley is aware of this conjunction
                     can be deduced from Walton's hope that his discoveries will help astronomers "regulate
                     a thousand celestial observations."</p>

                     his monologue is telling the reader a great deal about him that he does not seem to
                     realize. Since this is a technique by which fictional characterization is traditionally
                     accomplished, perhaps the reader will want to hold him as a character fully responsible
                     for his own sentiments. The Preface, we will remember, went out of its way to separate

                  <p>Leaving Victor's perspective to the side, we may, as readers, surely honor the affectionate

                     until later events can confirm that it profits her as much as it does those she so

                     on how hard the young Victor pushed himself, would have required the better part of
                     a week. In May 1816 it took the Shelley party six days to make their excursion from
                     Paris to Geneva, a roughly comparable distance. </p>

                     sea of ice" (II:9:18) and again in the final phrase of the novel where he will be

                     the operations of a destiny in which he is a mere pawn. Moreover, this force, however
                     much it may be involved in creation, is on a personal level destructive. As Victor
                     nears success in his endeavor to create life, it is as if the process directly saps
                     his own vitality.</p> 
                  <p>Perhaps, however, there is an alternate, less dire, way of reading this condition,
                     as reflecting Mary Shelley's own experience with motherhood. On some preconscious
                     mental level, Victor is shown to be replicating the experience of the expectant mother
                     whose physical being is strongly affected by the second being gestating in her womb.

                  <p>The reader cannot help noticing how insistently this theme returns to the surface
                     of the text. In the abstract it is almost an epitome of the way in which Mary Shelley
                     creates the structure of her novel as a nest of Chinese boxes (or Russian dolls).
                     Here, Victor Frankenstein begins a narrative about his life by emphasizing his father's
                     profound affection for another man, an account he gives to a young explorer whose
                     deepest emotional need is for such a friendship. Walton, in turn, feels he has found
                     the fulfillment of this need in Victor, and Victor himself tells this narrative out
                     of a sense of duty to that friendship. Duty likewise drove his father in his attempt
                     to discover and rescue Beaufort. At the periphery of this replicated order is the
                     central location in which the narrative unfolds, a ship isolated in treacherous northern
                     waters where the all-male crew stands on its duty on behalf of one another. In the
                     end harsh circumstances will force Walton to respond against his will to his own duty
                     to those men. </p>

                     his solicitude for the stranger's welfare clearly changes the dynamics of his shipboard
                     routine. Nothing will be reported as occuring aboard this ship for almost a month
                     while Victor through the narration of his life becomes himself a troubling aspect
                     of Walton's own existence. </p>

                     suspicion on Walton's part. The reader should take the doubt that is planted here
                     seriously, since questions concerning Victor Frankenstein's sanity will intensify
                     as the novel continues, becoming pronounced late in his narrative—which is to say,
                     in the novel's chronology, only weeks before his rescue. </p>

                  <p>A major hazard of navigation in polar regions was a wholesale distortion of magnetic
                     instruments caused by the proximity of the pure magnetic impulse. Walton seems to
                     expect that once the actual pole is reached, one could learn the principles by which
                     to adjust for such distortion. In 1831 Sir John Ross for the first time located the
                     magnetic pole, which is distinct from the actual geographical pole, in the far northern
                     reaches of Canadian territory. His account of his supposed discovery bears an enthusiasm
                     and rhetorical inflation little different from the tone Walton adopts here. From the
                     evidence gathered in the Parry and Ross expeditions of 1827 and 1829-31, respectively,
                     Michael Faraday was, indeed, to do just that, as promulgated in what became known
                     as Faraday's Law. A different desire seems to be drawing the novel's second searcher
                     for the north pole, and the one who will presumably discover its exact site a full
                     century before Commodore Parry, Victor Frankenstein's Creature. In Walton's fourth
                     letter to his sister (I:L4:3) he innocently recounts being passed by this figure on
                     his way to the pole. See also "wondrous power" above. </p>

                  <p>The aspirations to happiness of all the major characters of the novel take very different
                     paths. Although less effectual than the principal male characters in bringing their
                     dreams to reality, it might be said that the women characters are all more directly
                     engaged in increasing the actual store of happiness in the world, whereas the men
                     in general attach themselves to a theoretical concept that rules their destiny with
                     often destructive results. Justine's emphasis on a practical ethics may also go beyond
                     conventional gender roles, reflecting the down-to-earth necessities of a servant who
                     has no choice but to work for and with others to increase human comfort. </p>

                     noblest endowments of humanity" (I:L2:4), perhaps naturally thinks of the Creature
                     within a conventional human framework, twice referring to him as a "man." This nomenclature
                     will change radically as Victor seizes the discourse and begins to define its categories.

                     rigid gender demarcation. That Mary Shelley so conspicuously calls attention to Victor's
                     gender stereotyping here allows the reader to be sensitive to it elsewhere in his
                     discourse without feeling that the text is being stretched to support a feminist interpretation

                     a belief in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects" (I:L2:6). In the context
                     in which Mary Shelley was writing, an apt synonym for the word would be "romantic."

                     was dismasted in a gale on 14 June 1829. An engraving of this appears opposite page

                  <p>The stress on mathematics seems curious, given Victor's interests in occult and magical
                     lore. Still, Albertus Magnus was best known as a mathematician, and his disciple could
                     be expected to follow the master's bent. Perhaps Mary Shelley also wishes to direct
                     our attention to an underlying inclination to abstraction in Victor that will account
                     for his tendency to isolate himself from family obligations. </p>

                     that the young Victor Frankenstein is on the path to a mature respect for a scientific
                     discipline and those who practice it. On closer examination, however, this seemingly
                     innocent remark begins to build a foundation for a vexing issue in the novel: the
                     extent to which Victor's attempt to condition his rhetoric to the interests of his
                     listener is merely manipulative and thus, whatever its appearance, not wholly to be
                     trusted. As the novel progresses, this narrative indeterminacy will touch most of

                     wholly male crew of the ship will, later in the first volume, be replicated in the
                     exclusively male ambience of the University of Ingolstadt and the more narrow and
                     even sinister magistracy of Geneva. By the second volume the novel's main characters
                     have committed themselves and the novel to a homosocial bonding of enormous force.

                     Frankenstein from the tradition of popular gothic fiction to which, in his own adolescence,
                     he had contributed two outlandish examples, Zastrozzi and St. Irvyne, both published

                     the first third, of her novel to a close with her central characters in something
                     approaching complete despair over the efficacy of political and social systems. </p>

                     only through quotation marks, allowing the knowing reader to make the connection between
                     Coleridge's sublime tale of moral transgression and the events to unfold in the novel.
                     No effort is made to affect the time frame of the novel. In the 1831 text (I:L2:6),
                     on the other hand, Walton self-consciously attributes his own thirst for adventure
                     partly to the influence of this poem, presumably encountered among the volumes of
                     poetry he read after exhausting Uncle Thomas's library of discovery. This forces an
                     impossible chronology on the novel, since Coleridge's poem was published, as Walton

                  <p>Why Mary Shelley should begin the chapter by deliberately obliterating all suspense
                     is a good question not easily answered. Certainly, Victor's remark asks us to scrutinize
                     how this court conducts itself as a social institution and as a microcosm of the polity
                     of Geneva. Since Geneva's republican government (I:1:1 and note) and its softening
                     of class hierarchies (I:5:3 and note) have already been admiringly stressed, we might
                     expect from Mary Shelley's political allegiances to witness a trial conducted in ideal
                     circumstances. But that is far from being the case. Instead of a jury of peers, a
                     panel of male magistrates decides Justine's lot, and to exonerate a verdict reached
                     by only circumstantial evidence they employ the coercive power of the church to extort
                     a false confession. Victor's private denunciation of these proceedings does not indict
                     his own society or consider the extent to which his own family, that long line of
                     syndics, is complicit in an injustice that is all but institutionalized. It will be
                     left for his Creature, who is likewise victimized, to articulate the more radical
                     implications of such a society (see II:5:15). </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e3393"><span class="term">this monster</span> 
                  <p>As in the initial paragraphs of this chapter (I:4:3), Victor immediately renames the
                     "creature" of the preceding sentence as a "monster." On this occasion, however, the
                     succession of his namings will end by adding a new, more sinister dimension to Victor's
                     relation with the being he created. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e3400"><span class="term">the moral relations of things</span> 
                  <p>In distinguishing so sharply between scientific and moral arenas of thought, or between
                     metaphysics and ethics as branches of philosophy, Victor unconsciously begins to raise
                     what is perhaps the major issue of the novel, a human being's responsibility for knowledge.
                     His abstract nouns are themselves revealing: he is engaged by the "substance" or the
                     "spirit," whereas what impels Clerval are the "relations" of things. Clerval implicitly
                     looks at the universe in terms of communities, which is to say, in the largest sense,
                     as political relations; Victor concentrates on individual matters in isolation. In
                     respect to this dialectic it is interesting to contemplate how intrinsically committed
                     to both its sides is Walton. That dual commitment will in the end become contradictory,
                     leaving Walton on the horns of a dilemma, having to choose between pure science and
                     moral obligation. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e3407"><span class="term">more creditable to cultivate the earth</span> 
                  <p>Mary Shelley emphasizes the extent to which Elizabeth Lavenza not only has her feet
                     on the ground, but with her keen eyes surveys its opportunities as well. If her horizons,
                     in comparison with Victor's (or Walton's), seem limited by her expectations as a woman,
                     the drift of this sentence would suggest that they are also insistently humane. On
                     a biographical level the passage may reveal Mary Shelley's independent distrust of
                     the legal profession brought on by the problems Percy encountered from his father's
                     attorney as he attempted to secure the annuity promised him. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e3414"><span class="term">most interesting part of my tale</span> 
                  <p>Victor suddenly reminds us that this is a first-person narrative that may inscribe
                     a personal agenda. It is obviously of some value for Mary Shelley to keep her tale
                     "interesting," but Victor's recurrent concern with its impact raises questions about
                     his disinterestedness and his reliability as a narrator. </p>
               </li>

                  <p>Mary Shelley comments on such a play of lightning on Mt. Jura in her letter of 1 June
                     1816. In his own response to the powerful thunder storms experienced that summer,
                     Percy Bysshe Shelley characterized the summit of Mont Blanc as the "home" of the "voiceless
                     lightning": "Mont Blanc," lines 136-37. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e3428"><span class="term">The murderer discovered</span> 
                  <p>It is impossible to know for certain what tone—whether it is shock or relief—that
                     Mary Shelley intends to be conveyed by this exclamation of Victor's. In both the 1818
                     and 1831 texts he almost gives himself away, then recovers before his younger brother's
                     incomprehension and his father's subsequent imperious self-assurance and, rather than
                     be open with his family members in their crisis, closes off his knowledge and himself
                     from their confidence. </p>

                  <p>There is something irresistibly amusing and at the same time grotesque in this image
                     of an eight-foot baby muttering nonsense syllables and sweetly smiling. That our first
                     image of the Creature is with a grin on his face, however, is highly suggestive philosophically
                     and politically. The "pursuit of happiness" is a moral and political premise to the
                     late eighteenth-century world into which the Creature comes as new-born.</p> 
                  <p>As for the Creature's first interaction with a human being, a reader may well wonder
                     whether it registers upon Victor—or upon Mary Shelley—that this initial close encounter
                     comes via the German word for the mother he lacks, Mutter. </p>

                  <p>Although this novel is written very strongly from a male perspective, the accentuation
                     of female bonding here is an importance balance to that established between Walton
                     and Victor, between Victor and Clerval, between Victor and his Creature. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e3459"><span class="term">my childhood's companion and friend</span> 
                  <p>Isabel Baxter became Mary's close friend almost by accident. Mary's early adolescence
                     had been troubled, particularly fractious where her stepmother was involved; and Godwin
                     decided that some distance would have a salutary effect on her rebelliousness. He
                     contacted a radical acquaintance from the 1790s, Richard Baxter, a Scotsman who was
                     a good friend of his own friend David Booth, who agreed to accept Mary into his family
                     in Dundee. There at the age of fourteen she took up a happy residence that, as this
                     account indicates, combined a closeness to nature with a warm affection for the Baxters'
                     middle daughter Isabel. With this family she resided from June to November 1812, and
                     from June 1813 to March 1814. Her elopement with the married Percy Bysshe Shelley
                     not long after her return from this second residence ruptured her friendship, since
                     David Booth, who had married Isabel in the meantime, refused to allow his wife to
                     continue her intimacy with a woman who had so abandoned customary propriety. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e3466"><span class="term">my enemy</span> 
                  <p>Here Victor has not only demonized his Creature but has cast him in an adversarial
                     role, not acknowledging at this point that hatred can be as powerful a passion as
                     love and that antagonism can define a relationship with as enduring bonds as those
                     produced through affection. That this most distant of objectified namings coincides
                     with an almost hysterical sense of relief, indeed of liberation, for Victor suggests
                     the subtlety of Mary Shelley's psychological understanding. This is a moment of major
                     moral significance for the development of the novel. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e3473"><span class="term">My father wished her not to go</span> 
                  <p>Alphonse Frankenstein in the last sentence of the previous chapter admonished the
                     members of his household to rely on the court's impartiality (see I:6:44). Now that
                     the court has decided against Justine, he acquiesces in its pronouncement of her guilt
                     and sees the family suffering as brought to its term. It is hard not to see such a
                     compartmentalizing of human behavior as having some effect on Victor's habitual distancing
                     of himself from his emotional obligations and his duties to his Creature. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e3480"><span class="term">my first thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends</span> 
                  <p>Victor's language, after so many months of silence, is transparently insincere. Since
                     Clerval does not seem to notice, perhaps Victor does not either. Victor, however,
                     has himself already expressed the terms of his own indictment for such neglect of
                     his loved ones: see I:3:10. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e3487"><span class="term">my friend</span> 
                  <p>That Victor is capable of responding to Walton's open desire for his friendship by
                     reciprocating it implicitly suggests that there is a measure of free will still possible
                     in the universe, even in that small portion of it that constitutes his own ruined
                     existence. His recognition of the value of Walton's sympathy also underscores the
                     significance this emotion will assume throughout the novel </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e3494"><span class="term">my imagination was too exalted</span> 
                  <p>The word "imagination" is similarly exalted by Percy Bysshe Shelley in the first paragraph
                     of the Preface (I:Pref:1) he wrote for the first edition and, even moreso, by Mary
                     Shelley in her Introduction (see 1831:I:Intro:3 and 1831:I:Intro:11) to the third
                     edition. Yet, clearly the "doubt" that in these sentences is twice juxtaposed against
                     this power is meant to deflate its pretensions to be an absolute good. As the novel
                     proceeds, its questioning of the imagination will intensify. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e3501"><span class="term">My mother was dead</span> 
                  <p>The directness of this statement, which though cast in Victor Frankenstein's voice
                     was certainly written in Mary Shelley's hand, must carry at least a measure of personal
                     weight for an author whose mother died from complications of childbirth. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e3508"><span class="term">my tale conveys in its series internal evidence</span> 
                  <p>Victor credits his account with being logically consistent, but in twice terming it
                     a "tale" he raises the question of the truth value of any narrative. This joins with
                     the disparity detected in the previous paragraph between Walton's understanding of
                     Victor's virtues and Victor's own concentration on what we might think of as his vices
                     to reinforce how deeply perspective can infuse the "tale." This will become a major
                     subtext of this novel, touching all its main events. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e3515"><span class="term">My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement</span> 
                  <p>This significant emendation enlarges the connotations of the "ardour" expressed not
                     just by Victor at the beginning of Chapter II (I:2:1) of the 1831 edition, but by
                     Walton and the Creature as well. Victor here exonerates himself of any evil consequences
                     from this trait before we have sufficient information to corroborate his view or,
                     alternatively, to question how well his potentiality for violence has been displaced
                     into other pursuits. As he speaks, after all, he is still on a mission whose sole
                     purpose is the destruction of the Creature whom he brought to life and who has known
                     from him only rejection or rage. Walton, at this point, has solely Victor's word for
                     his guiltlessness. </p>

                  <p>What we now loosely call science—meaning the physical sciences—was until the mid-nineteenth
                     century referred to under the rubric of "natural philosophy." The long-lived journal
                     of the Royal Society, begun under Charles II in 1660 and still the principal avenue
                     for publishing scientific discoveries in English during Mary Shelley's day, was called
                     Philosophical Transactions. Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein in the heyday of British
                     chemistry, and it is this branch of natural philosophy that is most implicated in
                     Victor's education and obsessiveness. </p>

                     in using the term "natural view." But just exactly what he does mean is debatable.
                     Johnson's 1755 Dictionary gives eleven definitions of the word, none of which conforms
                     to our idea of nature as merely an external, visual phenomenon. </p>

                  </ul> 
                  <p>Given this spectrum of meanings, we might suppose that the first application, from
                     Victor Frankenstein's perspective, would be to the last connotation. He is, after
                     all, a scientist speaking to another engaged in research and suggesting to him that
                     the known boundaries of the discipline are inadequate to the realities he has uncovered.
                     And yet the fact that these earlier definitions of nature touch so pointedly on what
                     we might ordinarily think of as extraneous categories—moral or theological—should
                     prepare us for such an elaboration in Victor's narrative as well. The second and third
                     definitions, for instance, pertain as much to what Victor as creator imparted to his
                     Creature's mind as to his body, and the fourth might raise the question of his essential
                     morality. The seventh might revert to Victor's own psychological shortcomings, or,
                     depending on one's perspective, those of his Creature. That "power" is associated
                     in Victor's mind with his idea of nature allows us, as well, to cross the one spectrum
                     of meanings with another distinctive to that term itself. Again, Victor might think
                     of it in a strictly scientific sense, as a producer of essential energy, an aspect
                     of the electricity that is understood as a dynamic force by both him and Walton. And
                     yet, as we will eventually learn, his existence has in its recent history turned almost
                     wholly on an axis of personal power politics as he has struggled with his Creature
                     for dominance. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e3559"><span class="term">nature</span> 
                  <p>In 1818 Victor had used the ambiguous term "view of nature." In her revision Mary
                     Shelley makes clear that he is speaking not of a "natural view," but rather of the
                     range of possibility offered in the universe. This is compatible with contemporary
                     usage. Johnson's Dictionary (1755) gives eleven definitions of the word, none of which
                     conforms to our idea of nature as merely an external, visual phenomenon:</p>

                  <p>Given this spectrum of meanings, we might suppose that the first application, from
                     Victor Frankenstein's perspective, would be to the last connotation. He is, after
                     all, a scientist speaking to another engaged in research and suggesting to him that
                     the known boundaries of the discipline are inadequate to the realities he has uncovered.
                     And yet the fact that these earlier definitions of nature touch so pointedly on what
                     we might ordinarily think of as extraneous categories—moral or theological—should
                     prepare us for such an elaboration in Victor's narrative as well. The second and third
                     definitions, for instance, pertain as much to what Victor as creator imparted to his
                     Creature's mind as to his body, and the fourth might raise the question of his essential
                     morality. The seventh might revert to Victor's own psychological shortcomings, or,
                     depending on one's perspective, those of his Creature. That "power" is associated
                     in Victor's mind with his idea of nature allows us, as well, to cross the one spectrum
                     of meanings with another distinctive to that term. Again, Victor might think of it
                     in a strictly scientific sense, as a producer of essential energy, an aspect of the
                     electricity that is understood as a dynamic force force by both him and Walton. And
                     yet, as we will eventually learn, his existence has in its recent history turned almost
                     wholly on an axis of personal power politics as he has struggled with his Creature
                     for dominance. </p>

                  <p>Mary Shelley makes the intimacy with Lord Byron sound almost accidental. In fact,
                     it was all carefully arranged by Claire Clairmont, Mary's step-sister, who in a bizarre
                     case of oneupmanship that trumped Mary's affair with Percy Bysshe Shelley, had managed
                     to seduce Byron two days before he departed England in April 1816. By the time the
                     Shelley party reached Switzerland, Claire realized that she was pregnant from this
                     liaison. Although the relationship continued in Geneva, Byron soon tired of Claire
                     and came to dislike her, so much so that in subsequent years he would see the Shelleys
                     only on condition of her absence. </p>

                  <p>Again, as earlier (I:1:12) in this first chapter, Mary Shelley lays emphasis on a
                     non-competitive educational environment and the kind of non-coercive pedagogy employed
                     by her father. </p>

                  <p>This was the exact term Victor used two chapters earlier to describe his long illness:
                     see I:4:17 and note. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e3623"><span class="term">nervous fever, which confined me for several months</span> 
                  <p>The major symptom of a nervous fever in the eighteenth century is a total want of
                     strength. Thus, Victor's confinement to his bed in an invalid state for months would
                     not necessarily have seemed extreme to a contemporary reader. Still, by any measure
                     his appears to be no ordinary illness. Since medical terminology has changed radically
                     since the novel was written, it is not easy to transpose Victor's disorder into a
                     modern equivalent. Certainly, it would seem to originate in what is now called a nervous
                     breakdown: Victor's past record of constant fevers and what appear to be anorexic
                     symptoms suggest a systemic collapse of some magnitude. </p>

                     labourers of learning; but different abilities must find different tasks. To hew stone,
                     would have been unworthy of Palladio; and to have rambled in search of shells and
                     flowers, had but ill-suited with the capacity of Newton.</p>

                  <p>In I:L4:21, Walton also connects Victor with this attribute: "He must have been a
                     noble creature in his better days." Nobility would appear to include a capacity for
                     self-abnegation and thus to be incompatible with the burning force of vengeance that
                     drives so much of the action of this novel. </p>

                  <p>It is probably too early in the novel for the intonation of this phrase to resonate
                     fully, but by the time Victor has finished recounting his experiences and Walton repeats
                     these same sentiments (I:L2:4 and note), the reader will be ready to identify the
                     prototype standing behind this characterization as being that of Satan in Milton's
                     Paradise Lost. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e3668"><span class="term">This noble war in the sky</span> 
                  <p>This seemingly offhand sentimentalism is in actuality an exceedingly subtle move on
                     Mary Shelley's part, suggestive of how dangerous unexamined metaphors can be, especially
                     those that stem from our day-to-day existence and common practices. Victor Frankenstein,
                     deeply aware from his scientific experiments that electricity achieves its dynamic
                     energy from the interplay of polarities, here sees in the heavens an example of that
                     polarity writ large and, as it were, iconically—as elemental warfare. He will almost
                     immediately transfer that icon into an earthly counterpart, a permanent struggle between
                     positive and negative poles, by which he respectively denominates himself and his
                     Creature as good and evil, as figures of God and Satan. Thus, almost unconsciously
                     adopting a quasi-divine sign, Victor reinforces the animosity that allowed him conveniently
                     to categorize, externalize, and thus alienate as Other the Creature whom he brought
                     to life and then left to his own devices (see I:4:3 and note). </p>
               </li>

                  <p>Victor's unassuming choice of language, on a second reading, immediately brings to
                     mind his treatment of his own "creature." </p>

                  <p>This is, indeed, the case, and this fact deeply complicates the novel. The Creature
                     incriminates Justine not because he knows, as with William, of a connection to the
                     Frankenstein household, but because she is a person whose ordinary sympathies, he
                     presumes, would be blocked in his presence. Without thinking, he too victimizes Justine,
                     and he does it on the grounds, since sympathy is more readily expected of women, of
                     her gender. For his explanation, see II:8:35. </p>

                  <p>The trip home, as Victor testified in the preceding chapter (I:2:8), would doubtless
                     be long and arduous, but his passing two years without concern for his family indicates
                     the obsessiveness of his scientific pursuits and a concomitant retreat from normative

                  <p>Mary Shelley characteristically complicates the moral lines here. Even as Justine
                     is called a "monster," she resorts to her own habitual modes of religious instruction
                     to categorize the behavior of the murderer. That she happens to use the same terminology
                     as Victor does is a nice irony. But if we then seriously accept his own claim of ultimate
                     responsibility for this debacle, Justine's invocation of the devil is tantamount to
                     an ironic accusation against Victor, implicitly inverting his earlier (I:3:8) moral
                     exoneration of himself as a godlike creator. </p>

                  <p>In contrast to the shared grief and affection of Elizabeth and Justine, Victor has
                     immured himself in a barricaded isolation, unable to attract sympathy and, through
                     his lack of candor, unable also truly to offer it. That "misery" is the last noun
                     of Volume I, as "disaster" was the first (I:L1:1), brings the reader full circle within
                     that sense of perilous enclosure. </p>

                  <p>The terms have grown increasingly self-centered, until here Victor casts himself in
                     an absolute posture, anticipating a never-ending gratitude by the very function of
                     his bestowing animation on his creation. As usual, Paradise Lost presents the complementary,
                     though ironic text, in Satan's desire to escape what he considers a necessitated,
                     automatic response to God's genesis of spiritual and corporeal being: </p>      lifted up so high<br/> I sdeined subjection, and thought one step higher<br/> Would set me highest, and in a moment quit<br/> The debt immense of endless gratitude,<br/> So burdensome still paying, still to owe. . . .<br/> --IV.49-53</li>

                     Even that description, however, might be too bland for the usage of Mary Shelley's
                     day. Johnson's 1755 Dictionary defines "emulation" in a surprisingly harsh manner:

                  <p>Neither the Creature nor members of the De Lacey family hunt for food (II:4:5). Similarly,
                     for the most part, the Shelley household existed on a vegetarian regimen. It is unlikely
                     that such a pronounced abstinence from a meat diet can be discerned in any other major
                     novel in English.</p> 
                  <p>In 1812, three years before the summer in which Frankenstein was conceived, Percy
                     Bysshe Shelley published the first of this couple's reinterpretations of the Prometheus
                     myth, suggesting that the significance of the titan's carrying fire to earth was as
                     a means of introducing flesh-eating to humanity. From that point on the pristine human
                     civilization was ravaged by disease. This seventeenth of the sometimes very long endnotes
                     to his "philosophical poem" Queen Mab (a note to VIII.211) was republished as a pamphlet
                     called A Vindication of Natural Diet in 1813. </p>

                     Victor's mother Caroline has come to her death from the act of nursing Elizabeth (I:2:2),
                     and Victor himself has already been the subject of Walton's concerned ministrations

                  <p>Victor here unconsciously slides between the terms "subject" and "object," that is,
                     between what would possess a substantive being and what is merely a thing upon which
                     an action is committed. The odd inversion of the question, with its verb placed at
                     the end, likewise contributes to an effect of syntactical estrangement. This brief
                     moment of panic is thus highly illuminating, employing a linguistic shorthand to reveal
                     how Victor's thought processes characteristically distance and demonize his Creature.

                     "sledge [was] drawn by dogs" (I:L4:3), suggesting that he was able to cope with the
                     conditions of ice-travel without danger to himself or his team of dogs. The fact that
                     Victor says nothing whatsoever about his lost dogs is a subtly pointed, if silent,
                     comment on his self-absorption. That he has only one dog remaining would have made
                     his continuation across the ice, even if it had remained stable, almost impossible.

                  <p>The doppelgänger or double is a feature of gothic tales throughout the eighteenth
                     and nineteenth century. As a literary type, however, the double can have more than
                     sensational uses. Within a year of Frankenstein's publication, for instance, Percy
                     Bysshe Shelley incorporated the figure within the first act of Prometheus Unbound,
                     where the Earth tells Prometheus of a second realm of potentiality that shadows the
                     actual world: </p> 
                  <p>     Ere Babylon was dust,<br/> The Magus Zoroaster, my dead child,<br/> Met his own image walking in the garden.<br/> That apparition, sole of men, he saw.<br/> -- I.191-95</p> 
                  <p>Mary Shelley, too, is concerned with potentiality, both its development and its thwarting,
                     which she pursues on a number of different levels in this novel, projecting the doubling
                     on moral and psychological, but also on mythic and theological, grounds. Up to this
                     point in the novel the theme of doubling has been only hinted at in the intensities
                     of male friendship we have encountered. Here, in directly introducing doubling as
                     a psychological condition, her basic stress is on the self-division and resulting
                     self-destructiveness that, we may now begin to realize, is the driving force behind
                     the arctic pursuit that initiates Victor's narrative. </p>

                  <p>Paracelsus, pseudonym of Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, 1493-1541, physician,
                     alchemist, and mystic.</p> 
                  <p>Little is known of Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, who took the name Paracelsus
                     for himself. He was the son to a physician, and at the age of sixteen entered Basel
                     University where he studied alchemy. He later worked in the mines at Tirol, where
                     he gained first-hand knowledge of the properties of metals.</p> 
                  <p>By his early thirties he had become famous as a physician in Basel, where he gave
                     lectures on medicine. His disputes with the authorities in 1528 were symptomatic of
                     his abrasive and arrogant disputing style, and led to his expulsion from Basel. In
                     the last year of his life he settled in Salzburg.</p> 
                  <p>He argued that human life could be created through alchemy, and believed in the long-sought-after
                     elixir vitae as a means of infinitely prolonging life free from disease. His lasting
                     contribution to science is the rejection of Galen's humoral theory of illness.</p> 
                  <p>Percy Bysshe Shelley listed Paracelsus (along with Agrippa) among his favorite writers
                     in a discussion with Godwin in 1812. </p>

                  <p>The Northwest Passage, and (to a lesser extent because less practicable) the Northeast
                     Passage, were major objects of exploration in the later eighteenth century, renewed
                     after peace returned to Europe in 1815 with the strong backing of the British government
                     as seemingly being crucial to Britain's domination of the seas and to the commerce
                     that held together the Empire. As with other scientific aspects of Mary Shelley's
                     novel, this ambition of Walton's has a large cultural and political resonance.</p> 
                  <p>Before the creation of the Suez Canal (completed in 1869) and the Panama Canal (begun
                     1882, completed 1914), navigation between the hemispheres was a complicated process,
                     involving lengthy trips around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa or the Cape of
                     Horn in South America, both notoriously difficult to navigate. Explorers turned their
                     attention to the north, in the hopes of finding a means of sailing from the Atlantic
                     to the Pacific. Two major paths, a Northeast Passage and a Northwest Passage, were
                     sought for centuries, with minimal success. Northeast Passage The searches for a Northeast
                     Passage -- one from the north of Scandinavia, into the Arctic Basin, and along the
                     north coast of Asia -- began in the late sixteenth century. In 1596, fifteen Dutch
                     sailors, led by Jacob van Heemskerck and Willem Barents, tried to complete the Northeast
                     Passage, only to be trapped in June near the northcape of Novaya Zemlya. The sailors
                     were trapped there for months in an ad-hoc dwelling built from driftwood they called
                     Het Behouden Huys (the Saved House; the site was discovered in 1871). Their ordeal
                     was described in print by one of the sailors, Gerrit de Veer, in 1598.</p> 
                  <p>Most of the searches for a Northeast Passage, though, were carried out by Russia,
                     which hoped to increase the profitability of its fur trade by finding a more direct
                     route from the Atlantic to the Pacific. By the end of the 16th century the Russians
                     had established a commercial route via the Arctic to the fur-trading centre of Mangazeya
                     on the Taz River in western Siberia. But a polar passage was still greatly desired.
                     Several archaelogical digs in Taymyr in the 1940s provide evidence of an unsuccessful
                     Russian mission to sail the Northeast Passage in or shortly after 1619.</p> 
                  <p>By 1645, Russian trading vessels were routinely sailing between the Kolyma and Lena
                     Rivers along the Arctic coast. In 1648, Semyon Dezhnyov, a Cossack, was the first
                     European to sail what is now called the Bering Strait. He sailed east from the Kolyma
                     toward the Anadyr basin, believed to be rich in furs. Although several of his ships
                     were destroyed, Dezhnyov reached Cape Olyutorsky, from which he traveled overland
                     to the north to the Anadyr.</p> 
                  <p>Dezhnyov's voyage aroused interest in exploration in Russia. In the 1720s, Peter the
                     Great authorized a number of voyages to the area he had first sailed. It was Vitus
                     Bering, an officer of Danish birth who served in the Russian navy, who made the most
                     important discoveries. In 1728 he discovered St. Lawrence Island and sailed through
                     the Bering Strait (named for him) and well into the Arctic Ocean, although, because
                     he did not see Alaska, he did not realize how far he had in fact sailed. Four years
                     later, two Russians, Ivan Fyodorov and Mikhail Gvozdev, were the first Europeans to
                     see Alaska.</p> 
                  <p>The discovery of a passage to the Pacific led to the greatest operation in the history
                     of polar exploration, the Great Northern Expedition, which began in 1733 and continued
                     through 1743. Vitus Bering led the expeditions, carried out by nearly a thousand men,
                     many of whom died from cold, scurvy, or other accidents. Such setbacks caused the
                     Russian government to withdraw its support, but the mission was successful in producing
                     sixty-two maps of the Arctic coast from Archangelsk to Cape Bolshoy Baranov. The only
                     other Russian expedition in the next few decades was carried out by Nikita Shalaurov,
                     a trader without government support, whose party was killed by the cold in 1764.</p> 
                  <p>After Captain James Cook sailed from the Pacific north through the Bering Strait as
                     far as Cape North (now Cape Shmidt), Catherine the Great renewed Russian interest
                     in polar expeditions. Catherine hired Joseph Billings, a member of Cook's crew, to
                     travel overland from St. Lawrence Bay to Nizhnekolymsk in the search for a gap between
                     Chaun Bay and the Bering Strait. The gap was not discovered, however, until 1823,
                     when Lieutenant Ferdinand Petrovich Wrangel successfully navigated and surveyed Kolyuchin
                     Bay. Northwest Passage Only five years after Columbus discovered the Americas, England's
                     Henry VII sent John Cabot in search of a northwest route from Europe to the Orient.
                     Jacques Cartier and Gaspar and Miguel Corte-Real similarly explored Canada in hopes
                     of discovering such a passage.</p> 
                  <p>Navigators began searching in earnest for a water route from the Atlantic to the Pacific
                     in the sixteenth century with Sir Martin Frobisher (1535-1594); subsequent explorers
                     included John Davis, Henry Hudson (who in 1609 explored the New York river and Canadian
                     bay that now bear his name), and William Baffin. In 1768, Samuel Hearne set out on
                     a two-year walking expedition, which took him as far as the shore of the Arctic Ocean,
                     but he found no passage.</p> 
                  <p>With the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, England, in an attempt to secure its
                     naval superiority and the enormous commercial advantage that came with it, began what
                     eventually became a decades-long endeavor to discover the Northwest passage. The Passage
                     eluded explorers through Mary Shelley's lifetime; as late as 1845, Sir John Franklin
                     set out on an expedition that ended in the loss of the entire expedition of 129 men.
                     The Passage was discovered only in the 1850s by Sir Robert McClure, who led one of
                     the forty search parties that sought information on Franklin's expedition. McClure's
                     expedition was icebound for nearly two years, and was rescued by Captain Henry Kellett;
                     Kellett's ship was in turn icebound for another year.</p> 
                  <p>The Passage itself runs through the Arctic Islands of Canada some 500 miles north
                     of the Arctic Circle, only 1,200 miles from the North Pole. The 900-mile east-west
                     water route runs from Baffin Island to the Beaufort Sea through a field of thousands
                     of icebergs, and thence into the Pacific through the Bering Strait, which separates
                     Siberia from Alaska.</p> 
                  <p>Even after the Passage was discovered, it took another half century for a single ship
                     to sail through it: the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen made the passage between
                     1903 and 1906. Although the centuries-long search for the route was inspired by the
                     desire for a more efficient trading route, the first successful commercial navigation
                     came only in 1969, after the discovery of oil in Alaska. </p>

                     practised in Alphonse Frankenstein's household (see I:1:12 and I:1:26), a tribute
                     to her own education under the guidance of her father William Godwin. As she rethinks
                     the structure of the novel, it seems apparent that she wishes to shift that emphasis
                     from Victor's family (whose educational program she deletes) to Waldman as the professor
                     who guides Victor's mature scientific studies from a similar pedagogical principle.

                     second novel, St. Leon (1799) is given both the stone and the elixir by an old man
                     whom he saves from the Inquisition, and they effectively ruin his life. (Godwin's
                     preface to the novel suggests his larger purposes here.) Mary Shelley, who, we recall,
                     dedicated this novel to Godwin, in its pages thus frequently nods approvingly in his
                     direction. The connection to the alchemical theme of St. Leon was commented on with

                     between psychological attributes and physical features of the head, face, and body.
                     Victor has every reason to use the term, since his medieval mentor Albertus Magnus
                     wrote extensively about physiognomy and the mixture of humors in the body and mind.
                     As Mary Shelley would have been well aware, this discipline was resurrected in the
                     later eighteenth century by a countryman of Victor Frankenstein's, Johann Kaspar Lavater
                     (11 November 1741 - 2 January 1801), a resident of Zurich. His Essays on Physiognomy
                     (1775-1778; translated into English in 1789-1798) made him world-famous, inspiring
                     many a quack psychologist of his day, and many further days across the ensuing century.
                     More seriously relevant for the context of Frankenstein might be the title of an earlier
                     work of Lavater's, Geheimes Tagebuch von einem Beobachter seiner selbst (1772-73),
                     which was translated into English in 1795 under the title Secret Journal of a Self-Observer.</p>

                  <p>The vagueness of this reference, in contrast to the pointed citation of Erasmus Darwin,
                     perhaps suggests that Percy Bysshe Shelley, who at this point had only rudimentary
                     German, is operating here from report rather than personal experience.</p> 
                  <p>The chief figure among relevant German scientists would appear to be Johann Wilhelm
                     Ritter (1776-1810), who conducted extensive experiments in galvanism. Other commentators
                     have at various times suggested J. F. Blumenbach, Friedrich Tiedemann, Goethe, Schelling,
                     and Lorenz Oken. </p>

                  <p>Elizabeth's conformity to her female lot, staying in Geneva rather than traveling
                     to Ingolstadt to care for Victor, spreading contentment around her, being content
                     herself with "trifling occupations," has been a source of irritation to many critics
                     who, from this and similar evidence, see the novel as enforcing a mindless domesticity
                     as the only alternative to the overreaching of the male protagonists. Yet, to take
                     this passage at face value as the expression not of Elizabeth but of Mary Shelley,
                     is not really defensible as a critical reading. Elizabeth's blandness is an aspect
                     of her character. Her satisfaction with, broadly speaking, the beautiful is certainly
                     an aspect of the female role in this period, but in no way does her author resemble
                     her in this narrow predeliction. Nor does the novel unquestionably reinforce it. After
                     all, the first direct view we as readers have had of this serene landscape was as
                     a violent thunderstorm burst from over the Jura mountains (I:1:22). When in the second
                     volume Victor enters into, instead of gazing upon, this world of "snow-clad mountains,"
                     it will be to confront the sublime directly. </p>

                  <p>A statue of Rousseau stands in the square. During the Geneva Revolution of 1792-1795,
                     Geneva's syndics were killed in an uprising in Plainpalais. Mary Shelley recounts
                     this incident in A History of a Six Weeks' Tour, Letter II:</p>To the south of the town is the promenade of the Genevese, a grassy plain planted
                  with a few trees, and called Plainpalais. Here a small obelisk is erected to the glory
                  of Rousseau, and here (such is the mutability of human life) the magistrates, the
                  successors of those who exiled him from his native country, were shot by the populace
                  during that revolution, which his writings mainly contributed to mature, and which,
                  notwithstanding the temporary bloodshed and injustice with which it was polluted,
                  has produced enduring benefits to mankind, which all the chicanery of statesmen, nor
                  even the great conspiracy of kings, can entirely render vain. From respect to the
                  memory of their predecessors, none of the present magistrates ever walk in Plainpalais.</li>

                  <p>Caius Plinius Secundus, CE 23-79, Roman naturalist.</p> 
                  <p>Pliny the Elder was the author of Historia naturalis, the principal compendium of
                     scientific knowledge for the original Augustan age, a work to which Percy Bysshe Shelley
                     was introduced at Eton. He claimed there to have, for the most part, translated the
                     encyclopedic work on metallurgy, pharmacology, zoology, anthropology, and psychology
                     into English.</p> 
                  <p>The Natural History is the only one of Pliny's seven writings to survive antiquity
                     entire. That work in thirty-seven books was an attempt to survey all natural knowledge
                     systematically in an unadorned style, and his methodical approach and careful regard
                     for citation make it a model of ancient scientific research, in spite of Pliny's superstitious
                     beliefs in magic. Book 1 is an introduction to the entire work. Book 2 addresses cosmology
                     and astronomy; books 3 through 6 are on geography. The next thirteen books treat biology:
                     zoology in books 7 through 11, botany in books 12 through 19. Books 20 through 22
                     address medicine; books 23 through 37 are concerned with metals, minerals, and precious
                     stones.</p> 
                  <p>Pliny's authority was comparable to Aristotle's throughout the Middle Ages; only in
                     1492 did he come under attack in Niccolò Leoniceno's catalogue of his errors. From
                     then on its influence waned by degrees, and few regarded it seriously as science after
                     the end of the seventeenth century.</p> 
                  <p>Pliny died in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in CE 79, famously described in letters
                     by his nephew. </p>

                  <p>Mary Shelley deliberately joins the obsessiveness of artistic creation to that of
                     scientific pursuit. Although some commentators have assumed an implicit critique of
                     Percy Bysshe Shelley, he follows a similar path in "Alastor" (published in 1816).

                  <p>John William Polidori (7 September 1795-24 August 1821) was the son of Gaetano Polidori,
                     a Tuscan man of letters and at one point secretary to the dramatist Vittorio Alfieri,
                     who had emigrated to England where he married a Miss Pierce and settled in London
                     as a teacher of Italian. John was educated at Ampleforth, Yorkshire -- a Roman Catholic
                     school -- and subsequently matriculated at the University of Edinburgh, where he studied
                     medicine, writing a dissertation -- Dissertatio medica inauguralis, quaedam de morbo,
                     oneirodynia dicto, complectens ...  -- on the highly romantic subject of sleep-walking
                     and receiving his medical degree at the remarkably young age of 19. The next year,
                     still not yet legally an adult, he accompanied Lord Byron on his excursion to Geneva.
                     That Byron quickly tired of his protege's immaturity is well known, but Polidori was,
                     indeed, quite young and inexperienced to be in such company.</p> 
                  <p>Polidori left Switzerland for Italy in September 1816, where he traveled for nearly
                     a year, returning to England the following spring, at which point he sought to practice
                     medicine in Norwich. But he was unhappy in his profession and thought, instead, of
                     turning to law. In the meantime, perhaps as his own response to the heady literary
                     summer he had passed on the continent, he began a short, but productive literary career.
                     His first work was an extension of his interest in psychology, An essay on the source
                     of positive pleasure (1818). The following year came a volume of poems -- Ximenes,
                     the wreath: and other poems -- the novel Ernestus Berchtold, and the short story,
                     "The Vampyre," which, unfortunately, was passed off as the production of Lord Byron
                     when it was published in the New Monthly Magazine. When he found the work being published
                     under a separate imprint, Polidori went to some lengths to claim the work as his own,
                     but the scandal of imposture dogged him thereafter. His final work, Sketches Illustrative
                     of the Manners and Costumes of France, Switzerland, and Italy, was published in 1821
                     under the pseudonym of Richard Bridgens. That August, purportedly as the result of
                     contracting a gambling debt he could not honor, he committed suicide by drinking prussic
                     acid. He was 25 years old. </p>

                     Bysshe Shelley attended for less than a year and where a porter would lock the gates
                     during the night, barring access to the college until morning. Ingolstadt seems not
                     to have had such elaborately protective accommodations for its students. </p>

                     will unfold in the sequel. To some extent Mary Shelley is playing to a sentimental
                     conception of elective affinity in this portrayal, and certainly she is attempting
                     from the start to strengthen the romantic attachment Victor feels for Elizabeth. At
                     the same time, the extreme possessiveness of Victor's attitude is a characteristic
                     from which, in her personal life, she would have recoiled; and it is therefore no
                     unusual stretching of the rhetoric that would lead a reader to see in Victor's sense
                     of duty an implicitly demeaning condescension that reinforces an inherently masculinist
                     notion of power. </p>

                     and finished work on the novel. Over the next several months the fair-copy was read
                     by Godwin and several publishers; then in late August terms were struck for a contract
                     with Lackington, Allen &amp; Co. At that point a new preface of just four paragraphs in
                     length was written by Percy Bysshe Shelley, as if in Mary's hand. In the end, this
                     was the Preface that appeared with the novel. Mary Shelley's original remarks from
                     May 1817 have apparently not survived. </p>

                  <p>Victor's holding us in suspense constitutes more than a novelist's manipulation of
                     her readers. Frankenstein, unlike much of the gothic fiction of the previous half
                     century, is a novel without much interest in the sensational per se, rigorously subsuming
                     its dynamic effects to a larger narrative logic. Such a train of logical premises
                     is here invoked by Victor, as Mary Shelley emphasizes that a major structural division
                     in the narrative is about to occur. </p>

                     self-deprecation by Victor, without being conscious of the title of the first dramatic
                     redaction of her novel, Richard Brinsley Peake's Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein,
                     which she saw with her father upon her return to London in 1823. The word is never
                     uttered in the play, but the title clearly established a context in which Victor Frankenstein's
                     researches were from then on to be conceived; and Mary Shelley herself responds by
                     subsuming it within the third edition. </p>

                     has become clear that Victor is isolated from all the those to whom he is related,
                     either by blood or by intellectual affinity, whether they be family members, friends,
                     or teachers. The true object of his affinity, and passionate aversion, psychologically
                     speaking, has already been set. This will be the Creature whom he creates in the next

                  <p>Prometheus, in one strand of the myth, created human beings from clay, animating them
                     with fire stolen from Zeus. In another strand he stole fire in order to free humanity
                     from dependence upon the gods and was punished by Zeus by being chained to a peak
                     in the Caucasus mountains; there as an emblem of human frustration an eagle daily
                     tore at his liver, which was restored by night. Mary Shelley's father, William Godwin,
                     to whom she dedicated her first novel, stressed the second of these strands in the
                     section on Prometheus he wrote for his children's book, The Pantheon, or, Ancient
                     History of the Gods of Greece and Rome, which he published under the pseudonymn Edward
                     Baldwin in 1806. Mary Shelley's novel unifies all strands of the myth in a complex,
                     multifaceted form. Its "modernity" for the second decade of the nineteenth century
                     may apply broadly to revolutionary developments in political and scientific arenas
                     over the previous generation that transformed the intellectual landscape of Europe.
                     Although in the years intervening since the initial publication of Frankenstein, those
                     terms may be thought to have changed radically, the novel's modernity seems to have
                     remained curiously unaffected by such shifts in its local application. </p> 
                  <p>Mary Shelley's husband Percy Bysshe Shelley began his own modernization of the Prometheus
                     legend barely nine months after the publication of Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus.

                  <p>Victor unwittingly emphasizes the strong social conscience and sense of duty of his
                     father and other members of his family. Within a few chapters, in contrast, we will
                     witness his own abnegation of both qualities as he is seized by an obsession with
                     scientific pursuits that impels a withdrawal from all his social obligations. </p>

                  <p>Henry Colburn and Richard Bentley began the Standard Novels series as a way to restore
                     to the public popular works of fiction that were either out of print or only available
                     in expensive multi-volume formats. A crucial aspect of their editorial procedure was,
                     where possible, to have the author revise the novel sufficiently so that a fresh copyright
                     could be drawn upon the new publication. Given the opportunity, Mary Shelley was happy
                     to have the chance to polish and, in some cases, expand upon her earlier production.
                     Unwittingly, however, in assigning the copyright of her work to the Standard Novels
                     series, she forestalled the novel's reappearance for a generation, with the consequence
                     that Frankenstein was not republished in England until the 1860s. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e4244"><span class="term">pursued it for its own sake</span> 
                  <p>As admirable as this observation may seem at first glance, it carries an obverse side
                     that will soon be borne out to an extreme condition. By the end of this chapter Victor
                     will begin to ignore everything extrinsic to his scientific inquiry, spurning the
                     world outside his laboratory and devoting himself to his research there with an abandon
                     tantamount to a neurotic compulsion. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e4251"><span class="term">pursuit of knowledge</span> 
                  <p>Although this appears a sensible maxim, on extended examination it tends to favor
                     a low level of ambition and to inhibit most attempts to reach beyond a status quo.
                     The "tranquillity" attained in this way, seeming to forestall the pursuit of excellence
                     in a particular field of endeavor, or a concentrated exertion to achieve a particular
                     goal, or, indeed, any real application of genius, rather assumes the appearance of
                     passivity or inertia. Although certainly, Victor's remark questions the activities
                     not just of himself but of his auditor, Walton, as well, and thus fits into the overall
                     moral rationale for his narration, this blanket reversal of both of their strongest
                     impulses is likely to create a counterthrust of ambiguity in the reader's reaction
                     to the statement.</p> 
                  <p>Behind the statement and our reaction to it lies the cosmic ambiguity of Milton's
                     Paradise Lost, which exerts a continuing pressure on Mary Shelley's novel. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e4260"><span class="term">raising of ghosts or devils</span> 
                  <p>During the summer of 1816, M. G. Lewis, famous in the 1790s as a Gothic dramatist
                     and novelist, arrived in Geneva from travels in Germany to visit Byron. He brought
                     with him a copy of the first part of Goethe's Faust, which opens with perhaps the
                     most famous instance of raising the devil in modern literature. Undoubtedly, Mary
                     Shelley had the alchemist Johannes Faust in mind in recording the obsessions of Victor
                     Frankenstein. She probably also had heard from Percy Bysshe Shelley of his own youthful
                     fantasies toward this end. One example dates from his adolescent years at Eton College:
                     </p> 
                  <p>One day Mr. Bethell, suspecting from strange noises overhead that his pupil was engaged
                     in nefarious scientific pursuits, suddenly appeared in Shelley's rooms; to his consternation
                     he found the culprit apparently half enveloped in a blue flame. "What on earth are
                     you doing, Shelley?" "Please sir," came the answer in the quietest tone, "I am raising
                     the devil." <br/> <br/> -- Edward Dowden, The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley (London: Kegan, Paul, Trench &amp;
                     Co, 1886), I, 30.</p> 
                  <p>The poet is at once more circumspect and self-dramatizing in the account of his brushes
                     with the supernatural in the "Hymn to Intellectual Beauty," stanza 5, written contemporaneously
                     with Frankenstein. </p>

                  <p>The language, tinged with eroticism, is suggestive of the narcissistic dimensions
                     of Victor's preoccupation with his knowledge and the power that might stem from it.
                     Johnson, in his 1755 Dictionary, becomes loquacious in his definition of the word,
                     suggesting shadings with implications for the novel's thematic texture: </p> Ecstasy; transport; violence of any pleasing passion; enthusiasm; uncommon heat of
                  imagination.</li>

                  <p>Once again, as in the previous chapter (see I:6:25), the question is raised of how
                     one can objectively measure sanity in circumstances that are themselves beyond the
                     ordinary. Insofar as the earlier occasion also reminded us of the precariousness of
                     Victor's own mental state, this iteration continues to keep that issue before our
                     eyes. </p>

                  <p>This diction may appear strange to modern ears, implying a notion of education as
                     constriction. Probably, however, it would not have touched a contemporary in such
                     a way. In Mary Shelley's day such regulation would have been construed as an adherence
                     to a disciplined, systematic method of education. Still, regulation must be a means
                     to a perceived end. In this respect, we may take the contrasting image of Victor Frankenstein—"Natural
                     philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate (I:1:15)—as quietly but insistently
                     ironic. </p>

                  <p>Surely, the reader wonders that Victor's remorse should be at this point so limited
                     in its focus. Mary Shelley's exposing of his naivete seems intended to plant anticipations
                     of a dramatic irony, with a concomitant enlargement of the field of Victor's guilt,
                     yet to be revealed. </p>

                  <p>Despite his conversion to the study of modern chemistry, Victor never relinguishes
                     the agenda of ancient alchemy with which he began his scientific education. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e4319"><span class="term">republican institutions</span> 
                  <p>As at the beginning of the first chapter (I:1:1), the democratic institutions of Switzerland
                     serve Mary Shelley as a foil to those of her own country. Especially at this time,
                     under the reactionary rule of its Tory government, "republican" was a pejorative term.
                     Mary Shelley shrewdly mitigates her affront to the current critical climate at home
                     by tying the term to the respectable context of Switzerland. Still, in its quiet way,
                     the word is an affront. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e4326"><span class="term">republic</span> 
                  <p>Switzerland was the single self-governing democracy in Europe in the later eighteenth
                     century. Although England sported liberal political ideals as a factor distinguishing
                     the nation from the rest of Europe, in practice its long battle against the French
                     and Napoleon had fostered a conservative reaction in which "republican" and "jacobin"
                     were virtually synonymous terms of opprobrium. This was particularly the case in the
                     years after Waterloo when, without an external enemy by which to rally the nation
                     and, experiencing a severe recession as a result of its rapid and radical demobilization,
                     the government was fearful of any expression of political dissent and began to prosecute
                     broadly to suppress it. Although Victor's emphasis on his family distinction seems
                     a gesture toward the familiar hierarchical structures of English society, the fact
                     that the first sentence of the novel as it presents itself ends with so defiant, if
                     understated, an assertion of liberal political values indicates the presence of a
                     submerged political viewpoint that observant readers will be able to detect throughout
                     the novel. That its contemporary readers would have recognized this aspect of the
                     novel is indicated by how strongly politics influenced its reviews, particularly the
                     one that appeared in the conservative Quarterly Review. </p>

                  <p>As with "courage," the martial virtue to which Mary Shelley here yokes "resolution,"
                     this word also evokes the characteristic diction of Milton's Satan. In arising to
                     call his forces to assemble, he marks his agenda: </p> 
                  <p>     how we may henceforth most offend<br/> Our enemy, our own loss how repair,<br/> How overcome this dire calamity,<br/> What reinforcement we may gain from hope,<br/> If not what resolution from despair.<br/> -- I.187-191</p> 
                  <p>When Satan ends the assembly by having his fallen legions endorse his plans to corrupt
                     the garden of Eden, Milton's language emphasizes the force of his resolution.</p> 
                  <p>          Thus saying, rose<br/> The Monarch, and prevented all reply;<br/> Prudent, lest from his resolution raised,<br/> Others among the chief might offer now,<br/> Certain to be refused, what first they feared.<br/> -- II.466-470</p>

                  <p>As understandable as this resolve is (and, perhaps more important to the reader, as
                     necessary to the plot line as it may be), still Victor's silence is fundamentally
                     problematical on moral grounds, constituting a denial of his own responsibility and,
                     through an absence of candor on both private and public levels, a failure of essential
                     human sympathy and justice. </p>

                  <p>Even as he honors Alphonse Frankenstein, Victor does so in terms that distance his
                     father into something of an icon for the principle of patriarchy itself. </p>

                     It is one of the clear occasions where Mary Shelley reveals herself as her father's
                     daughter, justifying the Quarterly Review's attack on her novel for its Godwinian
                     politics. For Godwin's treatment of retribution, see Political Justice, Book VII ("Of
                     Crimes and Punishments"), particularly Chapter 4, "Of the Application of Coercion."

                     "R. W." Thereafter, he does not name himself, and Victor, following the English convention

                     libertarian and populist associations, also retains a political connotation for Mary
                     Shelley's culture, particularly in the representation of the eccentric antiquarian
                     Joseph Ritson (1752-1803), whose Robin Hood; a collection of all the ancient poems,

                  <p>Why Mary Shelley felt it important to alter the legendary materials loved by Clerval
                     is unknown. It may simply be dictated by a change in the conditions of her culture.
                     Although Roland, the hero of Roncesvalles, is identical with the title character of
                     Ariosto's Orlando Furioso (one of the books specified in 1818), in this rendering
                     Clerval's interest in him is more "romantic," less bookish. His other literary passions
                     are of a similar generic kind, rather than for specific books. On the other hand,
                     that the Battle of Roncesvalles was fought against Saracen attackers, who are also
                     the "infidels" who held the "holy sepulchre" of Jerusalem against the crusaders in
                     Victor's third example of their texts of romance, indicates an early manifestation
                     of the interest in eastern, or Mohammedan, culture Clerval will later develop. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e4652"><span class="term">scarlet fever</span> 
                  <p>A highly contagious disease, usually encountered in childhood, caused by hemolytic
                     streptococus. It is spread through the air or through contaminated food, and was virtually
                     untreatable before the development of antibiotics, although penicillin and gamma globulin
                     have made it much less common in the twentieth century.</p> 
                  <p>Scarlet fever's onset is sudden (typically two to seven days after exposure), beginning
                     with a sore throat, shivering, and a headache. It develops on the second day into
                     a rash behind the ears, which spreads to the arms and legs. Thomas Sydenham, a physician
                     of the late seventeenth century, describes its symptoms thus: "The skin is marked
                     with small, red spots, more frequent, more diffuse, and more red than in measles.
                     These last two or three days. They then disappear, leaving the skin covered with brawny
                     squamulae [scales], as if powdered with meal." Scarlet fever leaves the glands swollen
                     and often sensitive; in some cases, the squamulae on parts of the patient's skin peel
                     off.</p> 
                  <p>The greatest threats arise from complications. Sinus infections, abcesses of the ear,
                     and mastoiditis are common. In a few cases, scarlet fever leads to arthritis, rheumatic
                     fever, or kidney failure.</p>

                  <p>Slaves forever in a rage. In her revisions Mary Shelley is betrayed into a historical
                     anachronism, for it was only with the Congress of Vienna of 1814-15 that Austria,
                     already given the northeastern section of Italy in 1797, additionally was ceded Lombardy.
                     Its capital, Milan, was thereafter a center of subversive unrest, and many of its
                     leading citizens in the 1820s were convicted of sedition and incarcerated in the infamous
                     Austrian prison of Spielberg. Silvio Pellico's account, Le mie prigioni (My Prisons)
                     was published in 1832, the year after the third edition of Frankenstein, and became
                     a European best-seller. In the decade and a half following the Congress of Vienna,
                     Britain became a center for exiles from the Milanese intelligentsia, among whom was
                     Gabriele Rossetti, father of Christina and Dante Gabriel Rossetti.</p> 
                  <p>As contemporary English readers might be anticipated almost automatically to sympathize
                     with the plight of a Milanese exile, so they would respond to the essentially imperialist
                     ethos of this description of the blond beauty distinguished as a "rose among dark-leaved
                     brambles." Both Elizabeth's aristocratic background and her fair northern beauty play
                     to the expectations of the main line of British fiction in the early 1830s, what because
                     of its high-bourgeois conventions has come to be called "the Silver Fork School."

                  <p>Mary Shelley, her half-sister Claire Clairmont, and Percy had arrived in Sécheron
                     by night on 3 May 1816 and took up lodgings at the Hotel d'Angleterre where they remained
                     for more than a month before moving to the opposite side of the Lake at Cologny. She
                     noted in a letter of 1 June (published in The History of a Six Weeks' Tour as Letter
                     II) that Geneva "is surrounded by a wall, the three gates of which are shut exactly

                     this rank might be. It could be that Walton was offered the position of second mate.
                     But, depending on the size of the ship, it could have been an even more imposing rank
                     than that. In the terms Walton will employ about his own command in the ensuing letter,
                     the second dignity would be, after the captain's lieutenant, the master of the ship
                     (I:L2:3). </p>

                  <p>This language resonates beyond the fictional world of this novel and links in complex
                     ways with the concerns of Percy Bysshe Shelley, who likewise focuses on this theme
                     in "Alastor" (lines 20-23, 75-82, and 116-28), where both the narrator and the Poet
                     whose story he tells are obsessed with uncovering secret lore; in the "Hymn to Intellectual
                     Beauty," stanza 5, where Shelley recounts his own youthful investment in the supernatural;
                     and in "Mont Blanc," esp. ll. 139-41, where the mountain itself is represented as
                     holding secrets the poet would penetrate. "Alastor" was published in March of 1816,
                     and the other two poems were written that summer. In addition, the theme is continually
                     sounded in The Revolt of Islam, the long narrative poem he composed while Mary Shelley
                     was simultaneously writing Frankenstein: (see esp. Canto II, sts. 11-12, 20; Canto
                     IV, sts. 3, 6-8, 12). There Shelley gives a strong political tilt to the notion of
                     suppressed knowledge. </p>

                  <p>The terms of Walton's education are provided in I:L2:2, where he laments his neglect
                     of systematic preparation in his youth. It will remain to be seen in the course of
                     the novel whether Victor Frankenstein's more formal education served him better than
                     did Walton's autodidacticism.</p> 
                  <p>The question of self-education would have resonated strongly in the Shelley household.
                     Mary Shelley did not attend school and was largely educated by her father, who in
                     his early years had tried to read everything that was written and therefore was presumably
                     qualified in the highest terms to direct his daughter's intellectual development.
                     Though her husband attended the finest of preparatory schools, Syon House and Eton
                     College, P. B. Shelley was expelled from Oxford in his second term at the university
                     and thereafter amassed his considerable learning on his own. Mary, it should be stressed,
                     embarked on a similar reading program as her husband and, if still only eighteen when
                     she began Frankenstein was, by the standards of woman's education in her day, prodigiously
                     learned. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e4738"><span class="term">so expressive of sensibility and sweetness</span> 
                  <p>The description of Elizabeth, needless to say, is taken from stock; but it is likewise
                     defining of her later personality. For the many critics troubled by the way women
                     are portrayed in this novel, her stereotypical femininity, composed of a sweet temper
                     and refined imaginativeness, gives her no role to play in a male-dominated culture
                     but that of a potential victim of its dynamics. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e4745"><span class="term">shake my faith</span> 
                  <p>Victor's faith rests on nothing more than intuition. Indeed, he actually has fewer
                     facts to go on than the circumstantial evidence that indicts Justine. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e4752"><span class="term">Do you share my madness</span> 
                  <p>As with other additions made by Mary Shelley in the early pages of her novel, this
                     renders more explicit the extent to which Victor Frankenstein and Robert Walton share
                     much the same passion for knowledge. Their seeming differences are really superficial,
                     accounted for by the terrible cost experience has wrought on Victor and the sheltered
                     innocence in which Walton has been protected. Mary Shelley here likewise strengthens
                     her plot line, giving Victor Frankenstein a strong reason for bestowing the terrible
                     moral of his autobiography upon the enthusiastic explorer, allowing him, too, to be
                     the first to indicate that he might be mad. By questioning Walton's sanity as well,
                     he opens up large problems of reliability that the subsequent narrative will exploit.

                  <p>Justine is orphaned pointedly about the same time (the previous November) that Victor
                     Frankenstein gives life to his Creature, who is, like Justine, an unwanted dependant.
                     Unlike every other character in the novel, however, the Creature is cut adrift from
                     family protection not by death, but by a lack of human responsibility for his nurture.
                     Born in abnormal circumstances, he is without family, wholly unaccommodated in an
                     alien world. Where Alphonse Frankenstein virtually adopts Justine, his son rejects
                     the Creature he has fashioned. </p>

                  <p>As in the account she gave Victor in the letter of March of the previous spring (I:5:5),
                     Elizabeth accentuates Justine's ministrations. </p>

                  <p>In a novel so concerned with education this emphasis on Justine's advancement testifies
                     to Mary Shelley's belief in its universal value. This is of a piece with the arguments
                     of her father William Godwin in Political Justice (1793) and reflects as well the
                     strong democratic sentiments that Mary Shelley shared with her husband. It is important
                     to remember that, under her father's tutelege, Mary Godwin enjoyed an education that
                     in her day was equalled by only a handful of young women in England. </p>

                  <p>In the early months after Mary Godwin and Percy Bysshe Shelley returned to England
                     they were both afflicted with the deaths of women with whom their lives were closely
                     interknit. On 9 October 1816 Fanny Godwin, Mary's half-sister, committed suicide.
                     A month later Harriet Shelley, P. B. Shelley's legal wife, drowned herself in the
                     Serpentine River in Hyde Park. Those experiences would appear to be registered in
                     this elegiac paragraph. </p>

                  <p>This length would have been commensurate with the suggestive but unfinished "Fragment"
                     that Byron contributed to the writing contest, or with the longer piece, essentially
                     a short story, that John Polidori entitled The Vampyre; a Tale. </p>

                  <p>Mary Shelley's brief addition in 1831 emphasizes the extremity of psychological state
                     that lies behind Victor's critical physical debility. He is at once paranoid, profoundly
                     introverted, and vaguely guilt-stricken. In modern parlance his condition would be
                     described as psychotic. </p>

                  <p>In the early nineteenth century Turkey was the center of the far-flung Ottoman Empire,
                     which was to an English readership noteworthy for its autocracy and corruption. Perhaps
                     more to the point in 1831, that Empire abutted the growing British presence in India
                     and Afghanistan, making it a natural object of suspicion and prejudice. Whether Mary
                     Shelley thought twice about the terms of her analogy here one cannot know, but it
                     is a fact that Turks do not fare well in this novel. In its second volume (II:6:12)
                     Safie's father acts an ungenerous and even treacherous role. </p>

                  <p>That is, of a less highly developed genus. The language reflects the late-eighteenth
                     century fascination with hierarchical taxonomies in all the sciences (see also I:2:16

                     abattoir. What Victor thus rightly distinguishes in the previous paragraph as his
                     "new species" would seem to be an amalgam of several orders of sentient life. The
                     Creature's mixed status perhaps explains his superhuman strength, also the curious
                     fact that—like the herbivore cattle and horses to whom he may be physically indebted—he
                     is a vegetarian. </p>

                     Percy Bysshe Shelley, writing contemporaneously with Frankenstein, stages part of
                     the first canto of The Revolt of Islam in such a polar paradise derived from Indian
                     sources. The oxymoronic combination of fire and ice is a conspicuous feature of the
                     edenic paradise of Xanadu in Coleridge's "Kubla Khan," published in 1816 and read
                     that summer in the Geneva circle as Mary Shelley began writing Frankenstein. A strongly
                     ironic version of this coexistence of opposites informs the Creature's plans for his
                     self-destruction in the penultimate paragraph of the novel (III:WC:47). </p>

                     "secret stores of knowledge" ("secrets of nature" in 1831) Victor found in Cornelius
                     Agrippa (I:1:15) and perhaps also, as a point of contrast, of the emphasis shared
                     by all modern scientific discourse on open inquiry and testing results of experimentation

                     outlines it. Polidori himself, in the introduction to his realistic novel Ernestus
                     Berchtold; or, the Modern Oedipus 1819), identified that work as the one he began
                     as the response to the challenge given by Lord Byron. He did, however, also produce
                     a horror-story of his own in direct competition with Byron's unfinished fragment,
                     which he published in 1819 as The Vampyre; a Tale. </p>

                  <p>It would seem more than coincidental that the father would invoke a concept (depravity)
                     that entered the arena of this novel only the night before, upon the son's once again
                     catching sight of his Creature, "a depraved wretch" (I:6:23 and note). Also, the tone
                     of class condescension, although it may accord generally with contemporary attitudes
                     toward servants, has resonance within the larger social attitudes revealed in the
                     ensuing chapter. </p>

                     first edition. He appears to exist simply to inherit the name and estate when the
                     other Frankensteins die. Victor's ignoring his name, then effusively and sharply delineating
                     Henry Clerval's personality, might be seen as deliberate in its characterization.

                     make it impossible for him to reverse course and return to England across the top

                     a hold he has on reality at this point. Earlier, he had prided himself on his freedom
                     from this kind of childish fear: "I do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale

                     in a sign that is a portent of the future, turns in on himself. His defensive condescension
                     excludes much more than Professor Krempe from his perspective. </p>

                     issues for the novel: particularly, the extent to which our perspectives are implicitly
                     molded by aesthetic criteria. By this standard the Creature whom Victor will create
                     in his laboratory becomes a proof text for every figure who depends upon sight for
                     knowledge. Even if familiarity, in the case of Victor Frankenstein, allows him in
                     time to overlook the ugliness of Professor Krempe or of the Creature while in the
                     process of his construction, it is clear from the repetitive emphasis on Krempe's
                     size that Victor has an aversion to littleness. In contradistinction to Krempe, his
                     Creature will be eight feet tall (I:3:7). </p>

                     of the Neva River where it flowed into the Baltic Sea. There he built the city named
                     after his patron saint, officially establishing it as his capital in 1712. The extraordinary
                     dimensions of this achievement were still retailed with awe by the end of the century
                     when the 4th edition of the Encyclopaedia Brittanica (1797) dwelt at length on the
                     founding of St. Petersburg. Only in the second half of the century, however, did it
                     achieve the grandiose dimensions we now associate with the city. The major impetus
                     to its development was the building of the Winter Palace, the official home of the
                     Czars of Russia, begun by Peter III in 1754. In a palace coup that seems to have been
                     universally praised, the Czar's wife Catherine seized power from Peter III in 1762,
                     inaugurating the development of Russia into a modern and formidable nation. German
                     by birth, Catherine aspired to make her country not just a major European political
                     power but, more, one of its principal cultural centers. In her thirty-four years on
                     the imperial throne she amassed an extraordinary collection of art to supplement and
                     eventually supplant the Dutch-Flemish collection of Peter the Great: beginning in
                     1764. She had the fancifully named but grandly outfitted Hermitage built to house
                     these treasures. Likewise, she gathered a major library of over 30,000 books, whose
                     crowning glory was the acquisition of the entire library of Voltaire after his death
                     in 1778. In his later years he had been a frequent correspondent with Catherine, as
                     was Denis Diderot, the leading figure in creating for the French Enlightenment a compendium
                     of all that was known, the Encyclopédie. Diderot became her chief advisor on the acquisition
                     of art and in 1774 was himself persuaded to remove to St. Petersburg where he had
                     the singular duty of providing Catherine with an hour of learned conversation every
                     afternoon. Autocrat that she was, by the end of her life in 1796 Catherine had repented
                     of her patronage of the leading philosophical forces that had spawned the French Revolution.</p> 
                  <p>That the novel is first set in St. Petersburg may be, then, not a mere curiosity,
                     but a careful signal of its intellectual and cultural dimensions. Through it the reader
                     of Mary Shelley's novel is to understand that it begins intellectually where it stands
                     geographically, in the shadow of Catherine's enlightenment vision of a modernized
                     culture. Robert Walton's thrilling sense of scientific discovery, detailed throughout
                     this first letter, and Victor Frankenstein's endeavor to create a new being both share
                     that ambience. The open question subtly articulated by this initial postmark is whether
                     the dream of the new city or of the new human can alter the conditions that have determined
                     the old. Will the novel, like Catherine, repudiate the world it brings forth? </p>

                  <p>This careful specifying of Victor's intellectual passions and gaps is added to the
                     1831 text to prepare us for the kind of obsessiveness Victor develops when, in the
                     ensuing chapter, he arrives at the University of Ingolstadt. Yet, intentionally or
                     not, the emendation also introduces a remarkable contrast in character development
                     between Victor and his Creature. In contrast to Victor's nostalgic memory of an indulged
                     childhood, the Creature experiences no parental kindness whatsoever and must begin
                     life from an existential nadir. In doing so, he is forced to educate himself exactly
                     in the elements of knowledge for which Victor has no interest: language, law, and
                     politics. See II:4:9, II:5:10 and II:5:14. </p>

                  <p>This description of the Frankenstein household's educational routine appears to reflect
                     the principles of instruction practised by William Godwin in overseeing Mary's education,
                     which amounted to a rigorous education conducted totally at home. At this time there
                     could have been only a handful of British girls who received an education comparable
                     to hers. </p>

                  <p>Condemned by society and forsaken by the Church, Justine is left by herself in a condition
                     that is the opposite of a state of grace, caught in a lie made and reinforced by social
                     institutions. Not only do these institutions not practice the candor they may preach,
                     but they deny its possibility on an essential level. </p>

                  <p>In a patrilineal society Victor would be the principal heir of his father, anticipating
                     his succession to the principal share of the family estate. An English readership
                     would be well schooled in the legal circumstances involved, and, indeed, such exigencies
                     are at the core of many an eighteenth- and nineteenth-century English novel. Victor,
                     however, seems to think of this inheritance not just as a financial expectation, but
                     as a moral and civic obligation as well. We will soon come to realize, however, how
                     deeply he has failed to live up to the expectations of his father and of his earlier
                     self in this regard. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e4988"><span class="term">such proof</span> 
                  <p>Victor, it must be remembered, has no proof whatsoever, only the momentary intuition
                     the night before that his Creature was the murderer (see I:6:22). His having overnight
                     extended that supposition to the point of conviction once again ironically reproduces
                     the mental process by which Justine's guilt has been assumed before her trial begins.

                  <p>Even more than the previous sentence the phraseology seems deliberately erotic. Since
                     the issue of this labor will be a being created by a man without female participation,
                     the autoerotic emphasis of the diction, though perhaps surprising for the age in which
                     it is written, is exactly appropriate to the situation. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5003"><span class="term">sun and garden</span> 
                  <p>Although it is not said explicitly, this is a poetry defined by conventional feminine
                     concerns. Thus, Clerval's interest in it may implicitly suggest that realms exist
                     that allow a man to identify himself without simultaneously excluding the feminine.
                     In Percy Bysshe Shelley's Prometheus Unbound, Asia is an archetypal feminine figure
                     of emotion and intuition in contrast to Prometheus, the male avatar of the analytical
                     European intellect. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5010"><span class="term">no supernatural horrors</span> 
                  <p>This seems an innocent-sounding phrase, but if read carefully, it manifests what the
                     final chapter of Volume 1 will likewise suggest, that this novel resolutely refuses
                     to invoke a supernatural or transcendental framework for support. As human beings
                     can create other beings, they also mentally create a divinity to structure their universe:
                     the same human fallibility can attend both operations with tragic consequences. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5017"><span class="term">sympathy</span> 
                  <p>Clerval, who has already exhibited an instantaneous fellow-feeling for Victor where
                     others might be oblivious to his pain (see I:5:18), functions in the novel as a paragon
                     of sympathy. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5024"><span class="term">sympathy and compassion</span> 
                  <p>Doubtless, this will seem only a natural human reaction, but once we have experienced
                     Victor's narration of the agon through which he and his Creature have suffered, such
                     sympathy will appear to be a rarer attribute, all the more prized for how seldom it
                     is actually practiced by the major characters of the novel. Walton's reaching out
                     in sympathy stands in marked contrast to the universal reaction elicited by the presence
                     of the Creature. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5031"><span class="term">syndics</span> 
                  <p>Civil magistrates; government functionaries. The word does not appear in Johnson's
                     1755 Dictionary, but he does include the cognate verb, to syndicate: </p> 
                  <p>To judge; to pass judgment on, to censure. An unusual word.</p> 
                  <p>In the Genevan political system, according to the account in the 4th edition of the
                     Encyclopaedia Brittanica (1797), there were only four syndics chosen from among the
                     magistrates and these held the greatest authority in the republic. Geneva's syndics
                     passed a sentence of exile on Jean-Jacques Rousseau in 1762, a time we might suppose
                     included in Alphonse Frankenstein's "many years." Mary Shelley mentions the event
                     in History of a Six Weeks' Tour, Letter II. </p>

                  <p>Here, in a sudden reversal, Victor indicts himself, recognizing his responsibility
                     for the consequences of a scientific experiment over which he exerted no intellectual
                     or moral control. And yet, since he has neither evidence to offer nor can even place
                     himself within Switzerland when the crime was committed, he is effectually without
                     any responsibility in the eyes of society. Also, of course, he does not truly know
                     that the Creature was William's murderer and thus has, in any objective sense, nothing
                     to offer but supposition that would be inadmissible in a judicial proceeding. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e5063"><span class="term">the devil</span> 
                  <p>Here the succession of names brings Victor at last to the ultimate moral distancing,
                     positioning his creature as an avatar of Satan and thus grounding the extensive analogy
                     with Milton's Paradise Lost that is a marked feature of the novel. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5070"><span class="term">the education of his children</span> 
                  <p>Victor is implicitly drawing a contrast between the educational program he was provided
                     by his father and the lack of such a discipline in Walton's formative years lamented
                     by the mariner in his conversation with Victor some ten days earlier ( I:L4:25 and
                     note). The recurrence of this theme is manifestly deliberate on Mary Shelley's part.
                     What the reader is to derive from it, however, is not so certain, since there are
                     clearly ways in which, whatever his deficiencies in languages or in systematic application,
                     Walton's moral education will serve him better in the course of this novel than does
                     Victor's. </p>

                  <p>These were, as Victor Frankenstein had been reminded the evening before (I:6:20 and
                     note), shut at 10 o'clock every night. </p>
               </li>

                  <p>The plural pronoun, following upon the substantive "species," makes us realize that
                     Victor planned from the first to create a mate for his Creature. It is hardly surprising,
                     then, that he acknowledges the justice of the Creature's desire when he is recalled
                     to this expectation in Volume 2 (II:9:8). What in retrospect should be surprising
                     is the fact that he simply forgets his original design. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5092"><span class="term">their idle curiosity</span> 
                  <p>Walton's highly refined sense of good manners here keeps him from inquiring about
                     what had brought Victor to this desolate northern wilderness. His crew is much more
                     natural in its reaction. One may sense a certain class snobbery in Walton's tone here,
                     as there was in his earlier description of the sailors with whom he had to consort
                     (I:L2:3, I:L2:4). Of course, it might be argued that the class system that so rigidly
                     divided a ship's officers and its crew resulted in just such a dichotomy: it is not
                     to the crew that Victor will retail his painful autobiography, but rather to a person
                     of social breeding and intellectual ambition, if not education, comparable to his
                     own. On the other hand, it could be maintained that the tone here is wholly unintentional,
                     an unwitting reflection of the residual bourgeois tonality that Mary Shelley occasionally
                     betrays in her contemporary publication, A History of a Six Weeks' Tour, when confronted
                     with what she considers vulgar behavior. </p>

                  <p>Before, we had only Victor's intimation that he had somewhat procrastinated in communicating
                     with his family (I:3:10). From Clerval's remark we learn that he had all but ceased
                     to write them. </p>

                     Its mineral springs have long made it a popular summer resort.</p> 
                  <p>Thonon was at the center of a number of battles between the Duke of Savoy and the
                     Bernese during the Reformation. St. Francis of Sales performed missionary work in
                     the region, and worked to keep Thonon Catholic in the sixteenth century. It was taken
                     by France in 1792, but restored to Piedmont and Sardinia in 1816 after the fall of
                     Napoleon. </p>

                     It has been noted, however, that the shift of one day here (to Thursday, May 8) would
                     reconcile the timeframe, allowing us to date the year of William's death as 1794 and
                     of Walton's letter as 1797. </p>

                     abrogation of his responsibility and his transfer of obligation onto his newly made
                     Creature. It is the Creature who thus innocently asserts his shared bond, only to
                     find himself spurned by his Creator. Yet there is also a secondary irony behind the
                     first, for this account is narrated by a man who has been spending his recent months
                     singleheartedly pursuing the being from whom he originally ran away. </p>

                     edition of Frankenstein by several months, Percy Bysshe Shelley's fragment of an essay
                     "On Life" has a passage that may shed light on Mary Shelley's own attitude to her
                     adolescent student's disenchantment with a philosophical discipline that deconstructs
                     rather than creates:</p> 
                  <p>Philosophy, impatient as it may be to build, has much work yet remaining as pioneer*
                     for the overgrowth of ages. It makes one step towards this object; it destroys error,
                     and the roots of error. It leaves, what is too often the duty of the reformer in political
                     and ethical questions to leave, a vacancy.# It reduces the mind to that freedom in
                     which it would have acted, but for the misuse of words and signs, the instruments
                     of its own creation. —By signs, I would be understood in a wide sense, including what
                     is properly meant by that term, and what I peculiarly mean. In this latter sense almost
                     all familiar objects are signs, standing not for themselves but for others, in their
                     capacity of suggesting one thought, which shall lead to a train of thoughts. —Our
                     whole life is thus an education of error. (Reiman-Powers, eds., Shelley's Poetry and

                  <p>Mary Shelley here suggestively reveals that Victor's self-education involves no sense
                     of social responsibility for the knowledge he might attain. Victor's withdrawal from
                     Elizabeth and barring of Clerval from his confidence also initiates a pattern of being
                     secretive about that knowledge, whether it is in the construction of the Creature
                     (I:3:10) or the withholding of evidence from a court examining a murder (I:7:1). That
                     he has conducted his entire life without candor will increasingly be seen to have
                     implications for the veracity of the narrative, since, after such a pattern of evasion
                     becomes clear, the reader might well begin to wonder why we should credit what he
                     says in the present instance as the unvarnished truth. </p>

                     immured himself in a barricaded isolation, unable to attract sympathy and, through

                     but this quick reference has a particular force to it, reminding us that the Shelley
                     household was vegetarian. The torturing of animals in medical experimentation would
                     have been felt by Mary Shelley to be thoughtless cruelty. It is ironic, and clearly
                     not intentional on Victor Frankenstein's part, that his Creature turns out also to
                     be a vegetarian. </p>

                     British society in the early nineteenth century. Trade was looked down upon as narrowing
                     the mind and depraving the soul. One can sense the disparagement as Johnson offers
                     two definitions for "trader" in his 1755 Dictionary: </p> 
                  <p>1.One engaged in merchandise or commerce.<br/> 2.One long used in the methods of money getting; a practitioner.</p> 
                  <p>The same tone insinuates itself into cognate definitions: Trade </p>

                     the liberal arts or learned professions.<br/> 3. Instruments of any occupation.<br/> 4. Any employment not manual; habitual exercise.</p>

                     duress of this meeting. But if we take the language at its face value, it asserts
                     an uncanny oneness between Creator and Creature that will continue to reassert itself
                     through the subsequent course of the novel. </p>

                     wrote a tale, "The Vampyre," which he managed to have published under Byron's name
                     in the New Monthly Magazine of April 1819. His strained relations with Byron were

                  <p>Alphonse Frankenstein's delay in proposing marriage is motivated by a sense of decorum
                     and of tact. He neither intrudes on Caroline's grief nor openly plants a sense of

                  <p>This is the first indication of the age of a character in the novel, but a careful
                     tracing of its chronology would prove that Mary Shelley maintains a shrewd sense of
                     the relative ages of all of them. The emaciated figure of Victor Frankenstein who
                     will appear before Walton four months after this letter ("I never saw a man in so

                     human pleasures he experiences instead a disastrous reversal of expectations. From
                     this moment on his joy will never again be "unbridled," but rather, at best, what
                     Thomas Gray, in his "Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College," called "fearful."

                     startling irony. Not only does it play against Victor's obsession with acquiring knowledge
                     at any cost, only just now having attained its fateful consequence, but the diction,
                     so like the language of Walton's first letter (I:L1:2), reminds us that Walton himself
                     would not be an auditor of Victor Frankenstein's life story had not both of them been
                     in peril of their lives in the Arctic wilderness. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e5323"><span class="term">University of Ingolstadt</span> 
                  <p>The University of Ingolstadt was opened on 26 July 1472 under the patronage of the
                     Duke of Bavaria, Ludwig the Wealthy. For centuries its various faculties—humanistic,
                     scientific, theology, law, and medicine—were contained in the Hoheschule (High School).
                     By the end of the seventeenth century plans were elaborated for new university buildings,
                     but these were never realized. Nonetheless, during the ensuing century the University
                     was forced to expand. In 1760 George Ludwig Claudius Rousseau was appointed demonstrator
                     of Chemistry, and in 1778 a separate laboratory was constructed for him near the Hoheschule.
                     Given the time scheme of Frankenstein, it seems likely that Victor would have pursued
                     his studies in that location.</p> 
                  <p>But Ingolstadt was also very well equipped to support Victor's more elaborate scientific
                     ambitions. From the first, the University possessed a medical school of stature. In
                     1722 its faculty acquired a site for a projected school that would incorporate an
                     anatomy theater, botanical garden, and chemistry laboratory, and construction was
                     begun early in 1723 though, for want of money, it was not wholly finished until 1736.
                     A major botanical garden was attached to the school to support its experiments and
                     treatments. By 1755 the demonstration hall in the central atrium had been converted
                     into a two-story anatomical theater, with a dissecting table on the ground floor,
                     a gallery for student observers above, and a glass ceiling allowing overhead illumination.
                     In the later eighteenth century it was considered to be one of the finest such theaters
                     in Europe. Obviously, such a theater would have had ample provision for the specimens
                     required for teaching purposes—or for clandestine experimentation. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e5332"><span class="term">unparalleled eloquence</span> 
                  <p>Later Walton calls Frankenstein's eloquence "forcible and touching" (III:WC:6) and
                     just three weeks after the present letter the crew will witness its effect (III:WC:17).
                     But on that occasion the crew will not be swayed by Victor; and even Victor himself,
                     somewhat earlier, evinced himself as distrustful of mere eloquence, warning Walton
                     against the power of the Creature's speech and suggesting that it might mislead him
                     (III:7:26).</p> 
                  <p>Eloquence as a concept implicitly assumes multiple perspectives and an underlying
                     uncertainty as to where truth resides. It is thus focussed as a highly vexed issue
                     in the novel, which reveals itself to be at once selfconscious in its employment of
                     manipulative rhetoric and suspicious of the effects. </p>

                     low-grade fever. The damage to Victor's bodily system becomes clear as the paragraph

                  <p>Since study is itself customarily thought to be a passive occupation, Victor's employment
                     of the passive mood here calls our immediate attention to his unwillingness to accept
                     responsibility for a driving obsession. We have seen a like usage earlier (I:3:3 and

                  <p>Mary Shelley seems to have an adolescent's sense of what constitutes the "decline
                     of life." When we are introduced to Alphonse Frankenstein, a man who remained unmarried
                     for at least another two years after his decision to wed and and who then had three
                     children across a timespan of sixteen years, he seems as yet not to have begun the
                     decline attributed to him here. His delay in marriage is shared by Victor who finds
                     numerous reasons for postponing his nuptials with Elizabeth Lavenza. That this is
                     a family trait Mary Shelley wishes to accentuate rather than the reflection of some
                     antiromantic convention of her own or of her time is indicated by the case of Felix
                     De Lacey, who falls deeply in love at a young age. </p>

                     as the previous paragraph indicates, he had been introduced by Victor to the "several
                     professors of the university." Here, as elsewhere (I:3:10), Mary Shelley quietly underscores
                     the ease with which Victor shirks his family duties. </p>

                  <p>There is an unmistakeably strong resonance here of the final lines of Percy Bysshe
                     Shelley's "Mont Blanc," lines 139ff., written during the summer of 1816 when Frankenstein
                     was begun. Since the early chapters were conceived at this time, the reflection of
                     this particular poem would seem purposeful. That the greater part of Volume 2 of the
                     novel takes place below Mt. Blanc should reinforce the sense one has of a thematic
                     kinship between these two works. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5377"><span class="term">my own vampire</span> 
                  <p>So entwined are the fortunes of Victor Frankenstein's Creature and vampires in twentieth-century
                     popular culture, that to many it comes as a shock to realize that Bram Stoker's Dracula
                     dates from three-quarters of a century after Mary Shelley's novel. And yet, the subject
                     matters were entwined from the beginning. The story that Lord Byron vowed to produce
                     for the Gothic competition of the summer of 1816 was to be called The Vampyre. In
                     the end he dropped it, and the account was picked up and finished by John Polidori,
                     Byron's personal physician during this summer, who then published his novella with
                     the same title as that used by Byron so as to increase its circulation.</p> 
                  <p>Vampires were rather new on the literary scene at this point: general legendary knowledge
                     about them actually stemmed from a single source, the incorporation of a vampire in
                     Robert Southey's exotic and very popular oriental romance, Thalaba the Destroyer (1801).
                     Although the figure appears in only one stanza, it afforded Southey the opportunity
                     to show off his learning in a ten-page note. Since Percy Shelley was greatly enamored
                     of this poem, even reading it aloud to Mary and Claire Clairmont on successive evenings
                     in September 1814, there is little doubt that Mary had this account in mind in drawing
                     upon vampire imagery for Frankenstein. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e5386"><span class="term">vaults and charnel houses</span> 
                  <p>Johnson in his 1755 Dictionary defines a charnel house as "The place under churches
                     where the bones of the dead are reposited" and a vault as simply "a repository for
                     the dead." By the latter Victor Frankenstein probably means to distinguish a mausoleum.
                     Body-snatching or grave-robbing, a means of supplying cadavers for medical experiments
                     and instruction, was a source of great anxiety in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
                     It was, of course, a criminal activity. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e5393"><span class="term">it began to move with voluntary motion</span> 
                  <p>This constitutes something of a misreading of the kinds of experiments Erasmus Darwin
                     recounts in the first of his Additional Notes—"Spontaneous Vitality of Microscopic
                     Animals"—appended to The Temple of Nature. Probably Mary Shelley is taking figuratively,
                     as a kind of macaroni, the literal meaning of "vermicelli," tiny worms—what Darwin
                     calls "microscopic animalcules." Still, although she humorously exaggerates the kind
                     of spontaneous generation that drew scientific speculation in the early years of the
                     nineteenth century, it is important to recognize how seriously such experiments were
                     taken. Here, for instance, is the initial sentence of Darwin's "Conclusion": </p> {8} There is therefore no absurdity in believing that the most simple animals and
                  vegetables may be produced by the congress of the parts of decomposing organic matter,
                  without what can properly be termed generation, as the genus did not previously exist;
                  which accounts for the endless varieties, as well as for the immense numbers of microscopic
                  animals.
                  <p>Percy Bysshe Shelley also cites Erasmus Darwin in the first sentence of his Preface
                     (I:Pref:1) to the 1818 edition. </p>

                     inserted to suggest the opposite of its import, that the man who utters it is, or

                     He is portrayed by Shelley as Laon's protector and teacher in the contemporary Revolt

                     his family without an understood obligation to the court. The passive mood does suggest
                     his sense that he is trapped without a means of exonerating a person he is certain
                     is innocent. At the same time, in being attached to his own withdrawal from family
                     obligations, it may also indicate a more complicated pattern of causality than Victor

                     reflect on what it would cost for a private individual to organize and pay the complete
                     costs of an enterprise that in Mary Shelley's day was assumed by the British state
                     and, because of its not inconsiderable expense, was the subject of careful and even

                     was caused by the eruption of Mt. Tambora in Indonesia the previous winter, which

                     as readers to respond to it with interest and sympathy, should not detract from its
                     main function, which is to return us to the opening sentence of the paragraph before
                     and its honoring of the essential human link inherent to fellow-feeling. That Walton's
                     sympathy for Victor Frankenstein should extend to the reader's sympathetic reaction
                     to them both is a fundamental tenet of Mary Shelley's notion of the value of, the

                     On the one hand, one could see Elizabeth as wishing to hide from the darker realities
                     of the world and therefore as the embodiment of a kind of bland domesticity. On the
                     other hand, as we have witnessed in the previous two chapters, a human being can become
                     so inured to those darker realities as, like Victor Frankenstein, to lose perspective
                     and a due sense of social responsibility. </p>

                     The same unexamined connotations of the word touched on in Walton's honoring of it

                     ground set aside or simply taken over by a community for pasturage of the small flocks
                     and other animals belonging to its individual members. In the two generations previous
                     to the writing of Frankenstein commons had all but disappeared in the British Isles
                     as a result of their "enclosure" by landlords. The effect was enormously disruptive
                     of rural stability, as Oliver Goldsmith's well-known poem, The Deserted Village (1770),
                     recounts. </p>

                     as symptomatic of his physical debility, the first interpretation for many a reader
                     (and certainly for Clerval), that it is a sign of incipient madness, cannot be discounted.
                     A derangement of Victor's mental balance is too frequently insinuated later in the
                     text for it to be dismissed out-of-hand this early in its progress. </p>

                     Her arranging to have his namesake in the novel murdered has prompted some wonder.
                     Certainly, there was no lack of maternal affection: William Shelley's death in Rome
                     on 7 June 1819 was a devastating blow to Mary Shelley, issuing in something approaching
                     a nervous breakdown. </p>

                     that he so naturally evinces it. His openness will elicit a similar frankness from
                     Victor Frankenstein, who for the first time in his existence will tell his entire
                     story. But that narration, then, raises a serious problem. Not only are there many
                     signs of instability in it, the major one being Victor's wish to revise it even as
                     it goes along (III:WC:4 and note); but his earlier lack of candor with his family

                  <p>The "wondrous power" is magnetism. Mary Shelley, working within the accepted scientific
                     discourse of her time, in this second paragraph of her novel, is carefully establishing
                     a conceptual—the term in her time would have been "philosophical"—base for it in physics.
                     The key is provided by Percy Bysshe Shelley's citation, in the opening sentence of
                     the Preface (I:Pref:1), of Erasmus Darwin, to whom the reader may turn for further
                     elucidation of the scientific grounding of the novel. </p>

                  <p>This phrase recurs with frequency in the critical literature about the novel, partly
                     because it stands in such contrast to the almost divine attributes with which Victor
                     has up to now been honoring himself and his discovery. In the phrase there is not
                     only a sense of the irreducibly brute physical reality of what would have actually
                     constituted a butcher-shop but as well a decided undertone of self-loathing. </p>

                  <p>However odd this may sound to contemporary ears, it is certainly true that Percy Bysshe
                     Shelley deeply romanticized Mary's origins, seeing her as singled out by her birth
                     for great literary accomplishment. He pays tribute to her in these terms in his Dedication
                     to The Revolt of Islam, the epic-romance he wrote simultaneously with her composition
                     of Frankenstein. Although some commentators have seen the pressures to write to which
                     her lover/husband subjected Mary Shelley as pernicious, it did not originate with
                     him so much as in the milieu in which Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin was raised. There,
                     writing (William Godwin) and publishing (Mary Jane Clairmont, his second wife) was
                     what one did. </p>

                     (I:L4:16). The nomenclature in which he is vested confers an initial identity upon
                     him that will shift overnight from this enigmatic term of alienation—meaning either
                     being unhappy or vile (from the Old English word for "exile")—to the wholly out of
                     bounds, the monstrous (I:4:3). </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5593"><span class="term">wretchedly</span> 
                  <p>Here we encounter the first, ironic sign of Victor's bonding with his Creature. He
                     first called him a "wretch" in the second paragraph of this chapter (I:4:2), and has
                     just reiterated the epithet two sentences before this. Victor's adverb may seem innocent
                     enough, but when juxtaposed with the many instances later in the novel in which he
                     and his Creature will exchange places or nomenclature, it functions as a clear opening
                     signal of the complex narrative patterning to come. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e5600"><span class="term">wretch—the miserable monster</span> 
                  <p>Here what had been ambiguous in the earlier use of the word "wretch" (I:4:2) hardens
                     into monstrosity, a condition beyond the realm of the human. By the end of the paragraph
                     the Creature, in Victor's view, will once more transmogrify into a further dimension
                     of estrangement, the supernatural. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5608"><span class="term">a young girl</span> 
                  <p>Age is always relative. Mary Shelley was some two months shy of her twentieth birthday
                     when she began writing Frankenstein and well past twenty-one when the novel appeared
                     in print. Moreover, before she began the novel toward the end of June 1816, she had
                     registered experiences highly unusual for a young woman in the constrained environment
                     of Britain, including eloping with a married man and twice giving birth. That said,
                     it is true that the author was in years yet an adolescent when she wrote this novel
                     and that, historically speaking, most of its readers have been struck by a range of
                     knowledge, maturity of conception, and intellectual ambition unusual in one so young.
                     </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5615"><span class="term">your gentle and feminine fosterage</span> 
                  <p>This addition to the text seems motivated by a wish to make Margaret Saville a less
                     shadowy presence behind it. The implicit suggestion is that she is sufficiently older
                     than her brother to have cared for him when they were orphaned, though, considering
                     the twin facts that she has children in her own family and Robert is now 28 years
                     old, we must assume that the difference in age would amount to something like a decade
                     (III:WC:11). The added phrase also emphasizes the role of feminine nurturer assumed
                     by all the prominent women of the novel. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5622"><span class="term">you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own hand-writing</span> 
                  <p>However varied the reasons might be for the phenomenon, Frankenstein continually reverts
                     to the importance of documentary evidence to substantiate the truth of its events
                     or assertions. This will be seen as crucial in the case of the Creature's existence
                     and experiences (see II:6:7), of Victor's rectitude as a narrator (see III:WC:2),
                     even of Walton's day-to-day account of his voyage (likewise contained in letters "in
                     [his] own handwriting"). The pattern suggests that what is at stake here is the underlying
                     truth of all fictions. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5629"><span class="term">abhorred devil</span> The repetitiousness of Victor's diction—it was "abhorred monster!" at the beginning
                  of this interview (II:2:8)—seems fitting in circumstances where so many mirrored prisms
                  are being deployed simultaneously by Mary Shelley.</li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5634"><span class="term">the submission of abject slavery </span> This is a phrase that will resonate through the final third of the novel as the Creature
                  and Victor Frankenstein vie for mastery over the other's will. Although fundamentally
                  psychological in its formulation, the contention, as this phrase stresses, carries
                  political overtones as well.</li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5639"><span class="term">like Adam</span> Although the Creature here alludes to Adam's instruction by Raphael, which occupies
                  the central third of Milton's epic, the imprecation on his creator that follows in
                  the next paragraph bears comparison with the fallen Adam's indictment of God and lament
                  that he was ever born (X.720ff). Like Adam, although physically he does not bear the
                  imprint of his Creator, the Creature is indissolubly bound to Victor Frankenstein,
                  as is indicated by his frequent unconscious doublings in language or gesture.</li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5644"><span class="term">a duty</span> As he has before, Alphonse Frankenstein raises before Victor the notion of duty as
                  a contractual obligation between individual and family or state (I:1:1, I:3:10).</li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5649"><span class="term">the affections of a sensitive being </span> This antiquated terminology bears pausing over. "Sensitive" in this context implies
                  both "vitality, "human feeling," and an "independent will." The reciprocity of sensitive
                  beings is the foundation of all social interchange; thus, the key to creating a society.</li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5654"><span class="term">disgust and affright </span> The explicitly sensual terms with which the Creature characterizes Caroline Frankenstein,
                  unknown to him the mother of his creator-father, recalls his reaction to the first
                  sight of Safie (II:5:4 and note). Clearly, Safie is in his mind when the paragraph
                  ends with the anticipated aversion of a beautiful woman to his form.</li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5659"><span class="term">again, with a lessened form</span> That is, the moon has disappeared totally, then has just reappeared in its new phase:
                  so, a period of two weeks has elapsed.</li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5664"><span class="term">A gentle light</span> 
                  <p>The moon, which appears from details that follow in the narrative to be in its full
                     phase. It is so bright, in Victor's narrative of the night of the Creature's birth,
                     that "it forced its way through the window-shutters" (I:4:3), allowing him sufficient
                     light to discern the features of the Creature as he opened the bed curtains to discover
                     Victor. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5672"><span class="term">a hell of intense tortures</span> Again, the stress is on hell as a mental state that Victor bears within himself.
                  As demonstrated earlier at I:4:5 (and note) and I:7:30 (and note), Victor's internalization
                  of the pangs of hell-fire is a clear allusion to the misery of Milton's Satan in Paradise
                  Lost, especially IV.66-75.</li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5677"><span class="term">aiguilles</span> Literally needles: the term applies to the smaller pinnacles that rise in the periphery
                  of Mont Blanc.</li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5682"><span class="term">a lady</span> With the arrival of this enigmatic stranger Mary Shelley essentially completes the
                  cast of characters—which is to say, the balance of human and social elements—that
                  compose her novel. That Safie is herself an outsider makes her curiously similar to
                  the Creature who observes her entrance on the scene.</li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5687"><span class="term">All was blasted</span> 
                  <p>The language seems intended to invoke the "blasted stump" (I:1:22 and note) that is
                     left after lightning strikes the tree near Bellerive, a manifestation of the power
                     of the "vital fluid," electricity, that can at once create and destroy. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5694"><span class="term">A league</span> 
                  <p>The Oxford English Dictionary defines this unit of measurement as follows: </p> 
                  <p>LEAGUE: </p> 
                  <p>league lig, sb.1 Forms: 4-5 leghe, 4-6 lege, leuge, (4 lewge, 5 lewke, leuke, leeke),
                     5-6 leege, 6 legge, le(a)que, Sc. lig, 6-7 leag(e, 6- league. Late ME. leuge, lege,
                     leghe, etc., ad. late L. leuga, leuca (= late Gr. leu'gh, leu'kh), according to Hesychius
                     and Jordanes a Gaulish word; hence OFr. liue, liwe (mod.Fr. lieue), Pr. lega, legua,
                     Cat. llegua, Sp. legua, Pg. legoa, Ital. lega.</p> 
                  <p>a. An itinerary measure of distance, varying in different countries, but usually estimated
                     roughly at about 3 miles; app. never in regular use in England, but often occurring
                     in poetical or rhetorical statements of distance.</p> 
                  <p>MARINE LEAGUE</p> 
                  <p>marine league: a unit of distance = 3 nautical miles or 3041 fathoms. Although the
                     league appears never to have been an English measure, leuca occurs somewhat frequently
                     in Anglo-Latin law-books (Bracton, Fleta, etc.); it is disputed whether in these works
                     it means one mile or two.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5712"><span class="term">All bounds of moderation</span> 
                  <p>Although Victor had earlier moralized against letting the pursuit of knowledge run
                     away with one's sober judgment (I:3:12), here he portrays himself as indulging his
                     hatred with the kind of impulsiveness and lack of restraint he had displayed in Ingolstadt.
                     It is clear that what Alphonse Frankenstein had termed "immoderate grief" three paragraphs
                     earlier (II:1:3) is not Victor's problem. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5719"><span class="term">All pleasures . . . life</span> 
                  <p>This is a remarkable sentence, redolent of all of Victor's earlier obsessiveness but
                     now transposed into a kind of psychotic state. It is surely tied to earlier questions
                     about the unhealthy products of the human imagination. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5726"><span class="term">all the light I enjoyed came through the stye</span> 
                  <p>This is not easy to visualize, but Mary Shelley twice emphasizes the presence of this
                     stye. She appears to do so for several interrelated reasons: in order to have a natural
                     bulwark against the Creature's being detected by the cottagers; to place the Creature
                     symbolically as close to the natural order as to human beings; and to reveal, against
                     our visceral repugnance at the accompanying noise and stench (if the De Lacey household
                     had been able to afford to keep a herd of swine), the level of subsistence to which
                     necessity has reduced this being after six weeks or so of his existence. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5733"><span class="term">I am alone, and miserable</span> 
                  <p>In the 1818 edition the last noun of Volume 1, in Victor's narration, is "misery"
                     (I:7:33), and the second volume opens on a scene in which he draws further into himself
                     and his despair (II:1:1). Given the technical mastery of Frankenstein, it is thus
                     perhaps only to be expected that the Creature's autobiographical account should conclude
                     with the Creature in the exact condition of his Creator, sharing an existential misery
                     compounded of solitude and guilt. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5740"><span class="term">I will go . . . America</span> 
                  <p>Although there was relatively little Swiss (or German) emigration to the New World
                     by the time this novel was written, there was of course a great amount of it from
                     the country in which Frankenstein was published. Indeed, Percy Bysshe Shelley's grandfather
                     had been born in the British Colonies of North America (in Passaic, New Jersey), whence
                     he reimmigrated to Great Britain. The closest parallel for the Creature's plan, and
                     probably one that would be uppermost in the minds of a contemporary reader, was the
                     British penal colony established in 1788 at Botany Bay in Australia. There hardened
                     convicts were transported so as to rid honest citizens from their threat to the common
                     welfare. Over time, of course, these outcasts "civilized" a new continent. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5747"><span class="term">anger and hatred</span> 
                  <p>It may be difficult for the reader to suspend prior knowledge of the plot at this
                     point and recall that Victor's one sighting of his Creature in the vicinity of Geneva
                     does not constitute proof that he has done anything transgressive, let alone has accomplished
                     the murder of William and the framing of Justine. Given what Victor actually knows
                     of his Creature, this first greeting of him would seem to testify to a psychological
                     disturbance, if not a real derangement. Certainly, he does not treat him as the prodigal
                     son returning to his rightful father. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5755"><span class="term">anticipations of joy</span> 
                  <p>The diction seems deliberately intended to evoke the end of Chapter 5 of Volume 1,
                     where a full year later Victor and Clerval return from their walking tour around Ingolstadt—"with
                     feelings of unbridled joy" (I:5:19)— to be greeted by a letter from Victor's father
                     announcing the death of his brother William. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5762"><span class="term">appearance, different from any I had ever before seen</span> 
                  <p>The Creature had, of course, seen Victor before, but it was by dim moonlight, with
                     Victor first in bed, then rushing hastily from the room (I:4:3). This is his first
                     conscious encounter with another human being, whose mundane business is wholly disrupted
                     by this unanticipated and sublime intrusion. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5769"><span class="term">arbiters of my future destiny</span> 
                  <p>The Creature's sense of his destiny stands in marked contrast to Victor's. Whereas
                     the scientist sees himself as passively compelled by his destiny within an obsessive
                     solitude, whether in his experiments with the principle of life or, later, in pursuit
                     of the being that is its result, the Creature conceives of himself instinctively within
                     a domesticated social context where he will be guided by others toward his self-realization.
                     </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e5776"><span class="term">my arch-enemy, because my creator</span> 
                  <p>In Paradise Lost Satan bears this designation (I.81)—or is named Arch-foe (VI.259)—but
                     it is ironically reversed here to apply to the figure who stands in place of God.
                     Yet, to contemplate the phrase in isolation is to discern serious implications about
                     the relation between sire and scion of a type that have greatly concerned modern psychoanalytic
                     discourse. </p>

                  <p>Here the Creature joins the other principal male figures of the novel in the diction
                     of burning intellectual ambition, repeating the phrasing earlier uttered by Walton
                     and by Victor Frankenstein: see I:L3:1 and I:2:7.</p>
               </li>

                  <p>Although Mary Shelley in this chapter seems deliberately to be emphasizing the Creature's
                     "ardour" to place it within the context of the ambitions driving both Walton and Victor
                     Frankenstein (see paragraph 9 above and note), she is effectively contrasting them.
                     In the Creature's education language has a moral function, allowing communication
                     among beings and operating as an instrument by which they may think and feel in common.
                     True sympathy, the object of his utmost desire, is thus dependent upon language. </p>

                     discern in these altitudes the possibility of a transcendence of the human condition,
                     neither a human nor another kind of being can effectually manage to do so. Moreover,
                     "another race" of beings, if brought down from an imaginary conception to the solid
                     ground of normative human existence would be considered, like Victor's Creature, alien
                     and hounded from human society. The conflict between the unrestricted imagination

                  <p>This is the Creature's second knowing reference to Milton's Paradise Lost (see I.670ff.
                     and X.418ff.): the first was when he remarked that Victor, in creating him, had cast
                     him as Satan rather than Adam (II:2:11). The oddity of these learned citations goes
                     unremarked for now, but will be explained five chapters later (II:7:7). </p>

                     from his companions is conspicuous. The extreme variability of his movements here
                     seems intended to remind us of his condition when he welcomed Clerval to Ingolstadt
                     (I:4:12), hysterical and on the verge of a nervous breakdown. </p>

                  <p>The language once again affirms the Creature's affinity with nature and natural forces:
                     his atavistic rage is a sublime emotional storm. Yet, we should recall, the same is
                     true of that of the exemplary polished gentleman, Felix, at the end of the previous
                     chapter (II:7:38). </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5883"><span class="term">beautiful</span> 
                  <p>The beautiful, in this formulation, would seem to be a characteristic understood only
                     within a human context. That is to say, until the Creature can identify himself with
                     human concerns and human emotions, he cannot distinguish the beautiful. The corollary
                     of this, however, may not be so honorific to humanity. The birds with whom the creature
                     first identified in paragraph four above seem wholly unconcerned with the sublime;
                     but all humans are terrified of it and flee. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5890"><span class="term">I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty</span> 
                  <p>We have no comparable description of Elizabeth Lavenza from Victor, whose appreciation
                     of her virtues overshadows the few physical details he gives of her upon his return
                     to his family at the end of of the first volume (I:6:40). In the unself-conscious
                     innocence of the Creature, in contrast, not only do we realize that he has a nuanced
                     appreciation for the beautiful, but we also comprehend that strong romantic desire—not
                     a subject in which Victor seems particularly adept—is an aspect of his makeup, perhaps
                     to be considered normal for a human being, but in the Creature's circumstances deeply
                     problematical. Mary Shelley's delicate handling of the Creature's awakening to desire
                     is an index of the complexity with which she endows his character. </p>

                  <p>As the month is December, the sun in this fairly northern latitude would rise relatively
                     late, at some time around 8 a.m. </p>

                  <p>The language here has embarrassed some readers, but perhaps it is intended to be an
                     embarrassment, all hot air and vaunting, ineffectual before the power that animates
                     the eight-foot Creature. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5911"><span class="term">being</span> 
                  <p>Victor unconsciously repeats the neutral language with which the Creature concludes
                     his narrative ("This being you must create"). Within a few paragraphs, however, he
                     will return to his usual store of epithets. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5919"><span class="term">benevolent intentions</span> 
                  <p>It is fair to say that Victor's intentions almost always outstrip his ability to realize
                     them. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5926"><span class="term">benevolence</span> 
                  <p>It is a remarkable achievement of Mary Shelley's that by this point in the Creature's
                     narrative, this word (and its derivatives) have become fully ironized. Continually
                     repeated as it is (see, for instance, II:7:2 and II:7:9), this Enlightenment concept
                     stands in a kind of verbal isolation, unsupported by any examples that might convince
                     us of its dynamic, positive value, or even (outside the Creature's own actions) that
                     active benevolence exists. Thus the Creature's ironic conclusion seems altogether
                     appropriate. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5933"><span class="term">benevolence</span> 
                  <p>In this paragraph the Creature skillfully assembles the conclusions to be abstracted
                     from his treatment by the cottagers, touching on each of the themes so woven through
                     the fabric of his discourse. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5940"><span class="term">benevolent dispositions</span> 
                  <p>The Creature has been repeating this adjective (and the noun "benevolence") in seeming
                     insistence on the unquestionable virtues of the cottagers. Now, the intrusion of the
                     ensuing phrase ("I persuaded myself") and a next sentence in the form of a question
                     artfully raises the doubts his narrative has suspended. The entire paragraph, indeed,
                     evokes a litany of the high ideals of Enlightenment virtue gleaned by the Creature
                     from his reading and quietly interrogates their efficacy for "a wretched outcast."
                     </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5947"><span class="term">berries, nuts, and roots</span> 
                  <p>Although it might seem eccentric to some readers, a crucial aspect of the Creature's
                     bonding with the De Lacey family comes from the shared benevolence they practice to
                     the natural world. Their mutual vegetarian nourishment is stressed in these adjacent
                     paragraphs. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5954"><span class="term">Why . . . so wantonly bestowed</span> 
                  <p>This is the third time this phrasing has been heard in the volume. The first is at
                     its very beginning where Victor confesses that he "ardently wished to extinguish that
                     life which [he] had so thoughtlessly bestowed" (II:1:6). The second occurence takes
                     place during the encounter on the Mer de Glace, where under the intensity of the experience
                     Victor adds to his weight of guilt, vowing to "extinguish the spark that I so negligently
                     bestowed" (II:2:8). The Creature thus taunts Victor with his own words and desires,
                     but stresses the character of the negligence involved: his life, he asserts, has been
                     "wantonly bestowed," which returns him to his earlier line of attack: "How dare you
                     sport thus with life?" (II:2:7). </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5961"><span class="term">books</span> 
                  <p>The novel's continuing self-reflexiveness is quietly underscored here, but so is the
                     idea of a personal library. A further step in the Creature's education and his exploration
                     of his identity, reading books, rather than just overhearing them being read, frees
                     him from another's tutelage, increasing his own sense of responsibility and maturity.
                     Whether such books can make him happier is another question entirely. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5968"><span class="term">bound by ties</span> 
                  <p>As Alphonse Frankenstein continually speaks from the vantage of patriarch of the family,
                     asserting an almost tribal sense of bonded attachment, so the Creature confronts Victor
                     with his unique equivalence to those blood-ties, a bond Victor has from the first
                     spurned. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5975"><span class="term">burning passion</span> 
                  <p>There is an unmistakeable erotic charge to the language of these paragraphs, but it
                     is almost metaphysical in its conception. The Creature suggests that the rage awakened
                     within him, which is fired by his rejection and desperate solitude, can only be slaked
                     by being converted into a psychologically and socially constructive alternative, which
                     is to say love. There are ramifications here as well for the "ardent" pursuits of
                     both Walton and Victor Frankenstein. </p> 
                  <p>Although the notion of channeling libidinous forces into socially beneficial relationships
                     might be thought particularly suited to a woman's perspective on modern culture, the
                     conventions of the age kept most women authors from a direct engagement with issues
                     of sexuality and its repression or displacement. A notable exception is Mary Wollstonecraft.
                     Here one senses a true family resemblance. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5984"><span class="term">burst all bounds of reason</span> 
                  <p>The Creature unconsciously echoes the very language Victor (II:1:6 and note) had used
                     to express his violent aversion to him earlier in the chapter before their encounter
                     in the mountains. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5991"><span class="term">by the sun . . . heaven</span> 
                  <p>Given the richness of context provided by Milton's representation of the Judeo-Christian
                     Genesis in Paradise Lost, one cannot miss the alternate model being provided by the
                     Creature, a pantheism rooted in nature. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e5999"><span class="term">cause should produce such opposite effects</span> 
                  <p>Twice in the paragraph stressing the word "cause," the Creature learns that pleasure
                     and pain proceed from the same force, a considerable development in his education
                     and mental sophistication. If this is the groundwork of morality, however, it is important
                     to recognize that it shares a common bond, as the earlier quotation from Percy Bysshe
                     Shelley's "Mutability" may remind us, with the scientific systems that form so conspicuous
                     a context for the novel (see II:2:3 and note). There are other elements emphasized
                     in the novel that likewise exist on a neutral ground that can result in either good
                     or ill: curiosity is an obvious case in point (II:2:16). </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6006"><span class="term">I will cause fear</span> 
                  <p>In this phrase the Creature encapsulates what will become the dynamic force of the
                     third volume, an intense desire turned inside out and thus ironized, so that hatred
                     is pursued with the single-minded obsession of passionate love. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6013"><span class="term">across Mont Cenis</span> 
                  <p>This was the easiest route into Italy, across southeastern France from Chambery to
                     Turin in northwestern Italy. The Mont Cenis Pass rises to only 6825 feet. This was
                     Napoleon's invasion route to Italy in 1796, and thereafter the post-road was improved
                     to allow uninterrupted traffic between the two countries. It was this road, indeed,
                     that the Shelleys themselves would take shiortly after publication of the novel, in
                     March 1818, on their trip to Italy. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6020"><span class="term">the chain . . . excluded</span> 
                  <p>The reference seems again to be to Paradise Lost (IV.49-53), and specifically to Satan's
                     attempt to break the chain with which God links all his creatures in an eternal sharing
                     of selves. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6027"><span class="term">his companion</span> 
                  <p>Felix's companion is the owner of the house, who holds as security a quarter-year
                     deposit that because of his abrupt departure Felix will have to forfeit. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6034"><span class="term">thy compassion</span> 
                  <p>In effect, the Creature asks Victor to look the other way and listen to his story.
                     We will recognize the similarity of this plea to that made to the blind De Lacey when
                     the Creature first attempts to establish human community later in the volume (II:7:15).
                     Throughout Frankenstein sound, rather than sight, is the means by which human sympathy
                     is evoked. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6041"><span class="term">compassion</span> 
                  <p>An appeal to justice must necessarily depend on compassion, fellow-feeling. This is
                     the only occasion in the Creature's existence where, even momentarily, he has been
                     accorded what we assume to be that fundamental right of human beings. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6048"><span class="term">He was tried, and condemned to death</span> 
                  <p>This is, it should be obvious, the novel's second such condemnation of an innocent
                     victim after a summary trial. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6055"><span class="term">I did not strive to controul them</span> 
                  <p>The power of the Creature's rage is shocking, perhaps as well to himself after having
                     spent an entire year in isolation and under a regimen of strict and carefully enforced
                     self-control. The infinitive, however, reminds us how severely that control has been
                     earlier exercised by him. It might likewise call to mind the lack of restraint with
                     which Victor Frankenstein pursued the researches that resulted in the Creature's birth
                     (I:3:3). </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6062"><span class="term">conversed with my family</span> 
                  <p>Such incongruity of tone can have its value (though Mary Shelley did decide in the
                     third edition to remove the family presence altogether from Victor's excursion to
                     Mont Blanc). We will shortly be reminded that there is another part of Victor's family
                     he has assiduously avoided and to whom, unlike his conventional family, he has given
                     no solicitude whatsoever. The oddity of tone here, quickly rectified by the gloomy
                     weather of the next morning, almost unconsciously prepares us for the conversation
                     so feared and so long postponed but now, given the state of Victor's psychological
                     condition, clearly urgent. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e6069"><span class="term">names of the cottagers</span> 
                  <p>The naming of the cottagers depends not just on their individual identities but also
                     on their family, i.e., their social, relations. That they thus have several different
                     names, depending on which aspect is being emphasized, constitutes a new level of awareness
                     on the Creature's part. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e6077"><span class="term">his countenance bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and malignity</span> 
                  <p>The nouns here are all associated with Satan and the Satanic in Paradise Lost: e.g.
                     "anguish" (II.568; VI.340); "disdain" (I.98; II.680; V.666); "malign" (III.553; IV.503;
                     VII.189). And yet, the framing language forces us to consider perspective: "bespoke"
                     is not the same as "constitutes" in its implicit representation of reality; and if
                     Victor, even as he articulates it, openly remarks that he "scarcely observed this,"
                     where, then, might his terms come from? As we will learn from the Creature himself
                     (II:7:7), it is easy to insert oneself (or others) into the mythic texture of Paradise
                     Lost: thus it might appear, as it were, that Victor does so first, here defining the
                     Creature as Satanic not from sharp empirical observation but from literary—that is
                     to say, cultural—convention. </p>

                  <p>The change in verb form to a command is rhetorically powerful, but it also signals
                     a shift in, broadly speaking, the political dynamics of the novel. Victor's power,
                     a symbolic extension of that of his father and family, is no longer absolute, but
                     can be successfully challenged by the figure who stands in the position of his son
                     and who can command superior strength and tenacity. </p>

                     what a masterpiece of work he created only to abandon. Even if he is not reminded
                     of his original ambition to create "a new species," we certainly may be (see I:3:8).

                  <p>Under the creature's unrelenting accusation, the self-destructive nature of Victor's
                     hatred and its manifestation in the Creature-as-double are here at last openly admitted
                     by him. Percy Bysshe Shelley will use the same formula a year later in writing the
                     first act of Prometheus Unbound, where Prometheus summons the Phantasm of Jupiter,
                     the specter of his enemy, to repeat the self-enchaining curse Prometheus had once
                     pronounced upon Jupiter (see 1.258). There, too, the strong echoes of Paradise Lost
                     suggest a reading of God and Satan in the manner represented in his "Defence of Poetry,"
                     as co-complicitous doubles. </p>

                  <p>This chapter begins with a remarkable series of linguistic echoes in which the Creature
                     echoes the language of Victor Frankenstein, in part to indicate that comparable experiences
                     have produced comparable misery, but also to underscore the affinity of creator and
                     creation. The first element is this imprecation, a repetition of the curse Victor
                     pronounced on himself at their meeting on the Mer de Glace (II:2:14 and note). </p>

                  <p>The reference is to Inferno 23.58ff. Here at the end of the volume we are recalled
                     to the "hell of intense tortures" with which it began (II:1:1). </p>

                  <p>The moral power of this verb stands out against Victor's ineffectual name-calling,
                     reminding us that in some sense "curiosity" (a word with considerable resonance in
                     the first volume) is sport, as are all open-ended intellectual endeavors associated
                     with the imagination. The pejorative sense of the word as used here against Victor
                     is, appropriately, the sense invoked by Victor himself in silently indicting the Creature
                     during the trial of Justine (I:7:11). </p>

                  <p>Unlike his son (or, for that matter, Robert Walton), Alphonse Frankenstein shares
                     Justine Moritz's sense, uttered as her last words (I:7:31 and note), of the value
                     embodied in a humble, quotidian usefulness. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e6133"><span class="term">I declared everlasting war . . . me</span> 
                  <p>The emphasis here is on the psychology of alienation, as centered in the antagonism
                     between Satan and God in Paradise Lost (I.105-24). There, as Mary Shelley interprets
                     the emotional dynamics, a cycle of destruction results from God's rejection of Satan.

               <li class="item" id="d30e6140"><span class="term">deep, dark, death-like solitude</span> 
                  <p>The language seems intended to invoke both hell and the grave as being synonymous
                     with Victor's sense of himself, in the previous paragraph, as an "evil spirit." Behind
                     this language a reader may sense the solitude of Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, won
                     by Life-in-Death and obsessively reenacting his guilt. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6147"><span class="term">a deep and deadly revenge</span> 
                  <p>On an uncomplicated psychological plane Mary Shelley is representing the simple dynamics
                     of the Creature's alienation. With no other presence to balance or feel for this injustice,
                     in his solitude he works himself into a confirmed opposition to the world that has
                     rejected and threatened him. The Enlightenment virtues of benevolence and sympathy,
                     were they ever to be encountered by the Creature, would by their very nature undercut
                     his introverted and exclusionary mental state and enforce a social communion. Once
                     again, as in Percy Bysshe Shelley's "Alastor; or, the Spirit of Solitude," published
                     in March 1816, we recognize that solitude constitutes an evil spirit leading one to
                     ill. The opening paragraph of Volume 2, in which Victor Frankenstein reveals himself
                     similarly introverted and plotting revenge as a means of assuaging his self-hatred
                     is, indeed, an appropriate introduction to this dynamic that arches across the volume
                     (see II:1:1 and note). </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e6155"><span class="term">one as deformed . . . deny herself to me</span> 
                  <p>As at the beginning of this chapter, so at its end the Creature is willing to repress
                     his own desires to accord with the normative expectations of humanity. Although human
                     beings cannot endure his sight, he will inure himself to make ugliness aesethetically
                     acceptable to his eyes. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6162"><span class="term">the family of De Lacey</span> 
                  <p>The marmoreal cast of this sentence throws the emphasis on the family unit. Whereas
                     before the Creature had seen a patriarchal family as nurturing civilized values (II:7:6),
                     here he has reason to interpret it from a contrasting perspective, as harboring the
                     equivalent of ethnic prejudices on a small, tightly formed, and exclusionary scale.
                     With that perspective in mind one might return to the family unit that Victor Frankenstein
                     left a few hours back to consider how little different is its underlying ethos (II:1:3).

                  <p>There is a marked similarity here between the sense of honor of Felix and that of
                     Alphonse Frankenstein after rescuing the daughter of his old friend Beaufort from
                     poverty (I:1:5). </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e6176"><span class="term">Chief delights</span> 
                  <p>The Creature implicitly reaffirms his part in a natural order and his own affinity
                     with nature. Once again, we are reminded that in his composition there are non-human
                     creaturely attributes (see I:3:9 and note) that fit him for the wild. </p>

                  <p>Given the nature of the injustice visited upon Felix and his family, it is especially
                     fitting that Volney's Ruins should form the basic educational text in the cottage.
                     We should recall that it is from that book that the Creature learns, and Felix and
                     Safie are bitterly reminded, of the necessities of wealth and rank (II:5:16). </p>
               </li>

                  <p>Victor's workshop, he reported earlier (I:3:9), was a cell at the top of the house,
                     separated in a complex way from the main part of the edifice. Presumably, the bedchamber
                     to which he fled at the awakening of the Creature (I:4:3) was on a floor below. There
                     the Creature wandered and awoke Victor who then in terror plunged outside. By some
                     means unknown to Victor and unremembered by the Creature, the newly created being
                     made his way from the house to the streets outside the courtyard, where Victor spent
                     the night, and thence into the countryside surrounding Ingolstadt, where at last he
                     fell asleep. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e6197"><span class="term">desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge</span> 
                  <p>"Desert" here means "of the wilderness" (cf. III:3:1 and note). This account, then,
                     exactly fulfills the prescription innocently thought by Victor as he approached the
                     alpine range, that these mountains might be "the habitations of another race of beings"
                     (II:1:12). Since Mont Blanc was first scaled only in 1786, the fact that the Creature
                     has taken up his abode there indicates just how superior to conventional human endurance
                     Victor has made him. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6204"><span class="term">deserved better treatment</span> 
                  <p>This would appear a premonition of the Creature's own experience with the De Lacey
                     family. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e6211"><span class="term">the greater became my desire</span> 
                  <p>The Creature's intensity, like the suddenness of his admiration for Safie (II:5:4
                     and note), has the ring of adolescence to it. It is not, then, utterly surprising
                     that it should remind us of the diction of the two "ardent" men whose youthful discourse
                     we have already overheard: Walton (see I:L1:2 and I:L2:2) and Victor Frankenstein
                     (see I:2:7, I:3:1, and I:3:6). Burning desire is a characteristic all three share.

               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6218"><span class="term">my desolate state</span> 
                  <p>Desolation is, indeed, the appropriate term for a condition in which the Creature
                     is so alienated from his original state that he feels the rebirth of spring as an
                     ironic counterforce to his internal degeneration. Mary Shelley carefully marks the
                     inherent "unnaturalness" and thus self-destructiveness of such a psychological condition.
                     </p>

                  <p>None of the cottagers, of course, has as yet to lay sight on the Creature. It is a
                     mark of how self-alienated his education has made him that he can presume such a reaction
                     without having to put it to the test. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6233"><span class="term">the devoted cottage</span> 
                  <p>That is, reserved for destruction, the same usage as in the encounter with Victor
                     on the Mer de Glace (II:2:11 and note.) </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6240"><span class="term">Devil!</span> 
                  <p>This is the first word that Victor utters to his Creature. Perhaps, as the allusions
                     to Satan in the previous paragraph suggest, it is already in his mind. But, there
                     is a dimension to this epithet beyond its effectiveness as an index to Victor's mental
                     state, a timeless and mythic dimension. Although rigorously suppressed wherever organized
                     Christendom extended its arms into secular society, the writings of heretical theology,
                     particularly from Gnostic sects, continually revert to the concurrence of creation
                     and the fall as two aspects of a single event. Thus to create is to cast out, on a
                     universal level as well as, literally so, in childbirth. The cast-off in this case
                     functions as Satan in a dual sense—as a disrupter of the putative unity of God and
                     his coextensive creation, and—from the Hebrew root—as the accuser, who here immediately
                     upbraids Victor Frankenstein for not doing his duty by his creature.</p> 
                  <p>Note how carefully Milton embeds this coincidence, without heretically stressing a
                     linkage, in the moment where God divides himself so as to function on a second level,
                     as a Creative Word, the Logos that will render God's conceptual blueprint for the
                     universe into a workable reality (Paradise Lost, V.594-617). </p>

                  <p>Johnson's 1755 Dictionary offers us the appropriate definitions for this period, definitions
                     virtually lost to modern English usage:</p>

                  <p>The phrase "devoted head" is so common a usage as to appear to be a customary eighteenth-century

                  <p>As the preceding paragraphs have made clear, the more the Creature reads the more
                     he becomes conscious of alternate plot possibilities, of disparities between the worlds
                     conjured up by desire and the imagination and the inescapable reality of his condition.
                     Rather than find solace in his imaginative life, he experiences an increasing desperation.

                     another sign of the growing refinement of his emotional life. His oxymoronic response
                     to music (and perhaps to Safie as well) is a further example of how his education
                     proceeds by encompassing opposites (see II:3:6 and note). </p>

                     is no alternative to such opposition. </p>

                  <p>The diction reminds us of the numerous uses of "ardent" and its derivatives (from
                     Latin ardere, 'to burn': see definitions) in Volume 1: see I:3:1 for instance, and
                     note. Out in the world rather than confined to a hovel, the Creature's capacity for
                     ardor carries dangerous implications. </p>

                  <p>That it is to stop a child's naming that impels the Creature almost accidentally to
                     kill him is significant in several ways. Most importantly, the Creature is existentially
                     unnamed, lacking an identity that denominates a particularized selfhood and a socialized
                     connectedness, the sort of implicit identity by which William himself immediately
                     commands authority. It was Victor Frankenstein's initial duty as his creator to accord
                     him that name but he fled from the responsibility. Thus, everywhere else in the novel,
                     with Victor from his distance actively participating in the process, the Creature
                     is identified, not by a name but through epithets, as being outside a human sphere.
                     In a symbolic sense at least, William dies for his naming, for taking on a function
                     only his brother has the right to perform. </p>

                  <p>The "as yet" introduces an ominous tone into this account, but it also reminds us
                     that the Creature as a voyeur hiding from the world, experiences that world only vicariously.
                     That his retreat is fragile and his faith in the future tentative are all that he
                     can be sure of. Elizabeth Lavenza, expressing a similarly impossible desire to escape
                     the world, had articulated similar sentiments at the beginning of this volume (II:1:9).

                  <p>Victor, with something like a Genevan Calvinist's sense of original sin, cannot bring
                     himself to think of his Creature as created without internal flaw. What we hear in
                     his phrase is the language of depravity, which is not an element that ever informs
                     the Creature's narrative of his life. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6343"><span class="term">an evil spirit</span> 
                  <p>Mary Shelley seems deliberately to invoke the terms of Percy Bysshe Shelley's "Alastor:
                     or, the Spirit of Solitude," published in March 1816 a few months before the summer
                     trip to Geneva. The title was suggested by their friend Thomas Love Peacock, poet
                     and novelist, and an autodidact in classical Greek, who conveyed to Percy Bysshe Shelley
                     the aptness of using the Greek word for a kakodaimon, "alastor," as the governing
                     term for his poem. The word kakodaimon translates exactly into the "evil spirit" invoked
                     here by Victor Frankenstein, and its association with solitude is manifest in these
                     circumstances as well. At the same time, a sensitive reader cannot help observing
                     the likeness of this term to the diction Victor commonly uses to describe his Creature,
                     which he now, without recognizing the similarity, applies to himself. </p>

                  <p>Although we are apparently returned here to Alphonse Frankenstein's worries over "immoderate
                     grief" with which the volume began (II:1:3). We are reminded both that "misery" is
                     the last noun of Volume 1 and that the Creature ended his account of his life with
                     the declaration of his own misery (see II:8:36 and note). </p>

                  <p>Mary Shelley's insistence on the deference of daughters to fathers might be logically
                     connected with her dedication of this novel to her own father; at the same time, it
                     is rather at odds with her mother's views, and particularly with her running argument
                     against Rousseau's views on female education in Book 5 of her Vindication of the Rights
                     of Woman. What is odd in the present case is the fact that Felix does not mirror Agatha's
                     reaction. His stance suggests something of the distance between son and father already
                     accentuated in the case of Victor and Alphonse Frankenstein. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6364"><span class="term">a perpetual exile</span> 
                  <p>The status of persona non grata, if somewhat unusual, was certainly not unheard of
                     in France either before, or after, the Revolution. Napoleon, in fact, became famous
                     for sending those who displeased him into exile. With one of these, Germaine de Staël,
                     he got more than he bargained for: resentful of her criticism of his authoritarian
                     rule, he banished her forever from French dominions, whereupon she set out on a long
                     tour of Europe, speaking out against the Emperor of France and attracting legions
                     of admirers wherever she went. One reason that she established herself at Coppet and
                     gathered around her a set of pan-European intellectuals was that she could not return
                     to Paris. Mary Shelley, in the ambience of Geneva in the summer of 1816, would have
                     well aware of this record. Madame de Staël's last book, published posthumously in
                     1820, was called Ten Years of Exile. Whether Napoleon was afforded a copy on St. Helena,
                     his island of exile in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, is unlikely. Nonetheless,
                     Germaine de Staël decidedly had the last laugh. </p>

                  <p>It would appear that a month or more has passed since the Creature's birth, and with
                     autumn's end he is experiencing the decrease of nature's bounty. We are now in December,
                     and early signs of winter have appeared. </p>

                  <p>Up to now the Creature has been remarking seasonal changes and their reflection in
                     the landscape. Here, suddenly, the sense of internal divorce and self-alienation already
                     present in the previous chapter (II:4:4, II:4:13) opens out into a split between past
                     and present selves equivalent, as the emphatic language might suggest, to Adam's fall
                     from paradise. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6385"><span class="term">I felt cold also</span> 
                  <p>Victor Frankenstein has already supplied additional details to elucidate the weather
                     being experienced here. The Creature, he recounts, was born "on a dreary night of
                     November," and the next morning dawned "dismal and wet," with rain pouring "from a
                     black and comfortless sky" (I:4:6). Although, if we then follow the Creature's account,
                     it subsequently cleared sufficiently for the light to seem oppressive to him, later
                     that night, the time to which he is referring in his narrative, it reverted to a seasonably
                     cold temperature. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6392"><span class="term">the fiend that lurked in my heart</span> 
                  <p>As with the double resonance of "wretch" at the end of the previous paragraph, here
                     Victor applies to himself the term he had used to refer to the Creature three paragraphs
                     earlier. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6400"><span class="term">the fiend with an air of exultation</span> 
                  <p>Nothing in the Creature's statements in the previous paragraph—particularly given
                     the stark alternatives he lays before Victor at its end—suggests that he is exulting
                     at this point. Rather, the remark along with the epithet convey Victor's intrinsic
                     sense of superiority and of his right to wield a power capable of affording satisfaction
                     to an underling. Whatever Victor may regard as "the duties of a creator," they do
                     not yet forestall him from calling his creature a "fiend" and regarding him as "odious."
                     </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6407"><span class="term">fiend</span> 
                  <p>At the beginning of the chapter he bore the neutral term "being"; but, as Victor indulges
                     his rage, so the Creature's identity changes for him as well. </p>

                  <p>What the Creature does not know is that this will also be the last such expression
                     of kindess directed to him. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6421"><span class="term">I was a fool</span> 
                  <p>This calm reconsideration of his actions attests to the analytical capacities of the
                     Creature and pictures him once again as superior to those who spurn him. On a darker
                     side, it also exhibits him in the process of internalizing himself as Other and of
                     reifying a concept of normative reality in which he lacks any secure place. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6428"><span class="term">forced solitude</span> 
                  <p>Where Victor hedges, the Creature counters: as "evil passions" the phrase Victor employed
                     four paragraphs before, will disappear within an ambience of sympathy, so (as "vices")
                     they are the product of solitude. Again, we hear the resonance of the title of Percy
                     Bysshe Shelley's "Alastor; or, the Spirit of Solitude," published a few months before
                     Frankenstein was begun (see II:8:21 and note). </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6435"><span class="term">are you French</span> 
                  <p>In ordinary circumstances this would not seem so absurd a question. The fact that
                     the Creature lacks a national identity, however, throws into relief how deeply embedded
                     are national prejudices even among the enlightened. We have already witnessed in the
                     French reaction to Safie's father (II:6:3) and in his abuse of Felix's kindness (II:6:12)
                     how mean-spiritedness is served by national identity. Part of Volney's aim in Les
                     Ruines is to eradicate such defining ideological concepts. That the Creature is thus
                     born without them indicates his superiority and, ironically, is a further example
                     of how he does not fit into normative human society. </p>
               </li>

                  <p>Up to this point all the expression of sympathy has come as a surmise of the Creature's
                     about the cottagers. This assertion reminds us that for something like a year the
                     Creature has intervened actively to assist the cottagers in their daily existence.
                     His fellow-feeling has, indeed, extended into kind actions on their behalf. The heavy
                     irony behind this scene is that all the Enlightenment virtues the Creature has presumed
                     to be attributes of the cottagers have been employed by him on a daily basis. </p>

                     of the second (II:1:6 and note). The Creature will again be portrayed as gnashing
                     his teeth in the third volume (III:3:13). The prototype for this behaviour remains
                     the Satan of Milton's Paradise Lost, VI.340. </p>

                     for our access to language: "He gave man speech, and speech created thought,/ Which

                     reversal of that used by Victor Frankenstein to describe himself in the introductory
                     paragraph of Volume 2. There he conceives himself as wandering like "an evil spirit"

                  <p>The Creature, cursing both his own creation and his Creator, tellingly echoes Victor's

                  <p>This is an artistically crafted interval during which Mary Shelley deftly brings Victor
                     back to the center of her novel as a moral being. </p>

                  <p>This a sentiment born of Enlightenment optimism that Mary Shelley would have heard
                     echoed in her father's home as well as in the one she established with Percy Bysshe
                     Shelley. It is based on a sense of the shared values of the human community. For it
                     to be discovered a falsehood would profoundly affect normative ethical premises. The
                     very blandness of this discourse testifies to our comfortable assurances and prepares
                     the way for a devastating reversal of them. </p>

                  <p>The Creature has internalized the dynamics of Paradise Lost, setting himself as a
                     reactionary force to undo the world of his creator. That such desolation, rather than
                     a triumph, is inherently defeating and involves the undoing of his self is well understood
                     by Mary Shelley, yet to be learned by the Creature. </p>

                  <p>His limited reading immediately calls to his mind the mythic model for his profound
                     alienation, Milton's Satan, establishing a new line of psychological congruence between
                     the tormented Creature and Victor Frankenstein, who used the identical expression
                     at the end of Volume I (Chapter 8 in the 1831 edition): see I:7:30 and note. Victor
                     also makes similar statements in I:4:5 and II:1:1 (and note). The allusion is to Satan's
                     soliloquy upon Mount Niphates: Paradise Lost, IV.75. </p>

                  <p>We enter here into a third level of narrative, one that is embedded within Victor
                     Frankenstein's autobiography, which is itself being transcribed by Walton each night
                     of its recounting for his sister's future perusal. Issues of the authority and even
                     the reliability of any particular level of the narrative thus abound and have raised
                     serious debate in the critical literature on the novel. As the Creature twice in these
                     two paragraphs speaks of his "tale," so Victor refers to his narrative as a "tale"
                     as well (see I:L4:30 and I:3:13). The underlying question is how true is any tale.

                  <p>The combination of terms here may be accidental, but is wonderfully encapsulating
                     of the dynamics of the novel thus far. The Creature is denominated an Other even as
                     the fixed point for comparison is lodged in the established, public figure of Alphonse
                     Frankenstein, who, from the point of view of his sons (and of himself) is never capable
                     of being viewed in the light of alterity. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e6577"><span class="term">he placed his hands before his eyes</span> 
                  <p>This instinctive gesture is part of a pattern across the novel in which those with
                     sight must technically blind themselves in order to endure the presence of the Creature:
                     see I:4:3 and note. </p>

                  <p>This could mean, narrowly, that Felix had been educated for the French diplomatic
                     corps or, more broadly, to function in the upper levels of the government bureaucracy.
                     Whatever the case, there is a clear link between his family and expectations and those
                     of Victor Frankenstein, whose father and forefathers, from a strong sense of civic
                     duty, have held positions of public trust in Geneva. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e6591"><span class="term">How can I move thee</span> 
                  <p>As Victor is self-conscious about the shape and impact of his narrative (see I:7:13
                     and note), so is his Creature. His question also curiously echoes Justine Moritz's
                     recognition that facts alone are not sufficient to exonerate her (I:7:5 and note);
                     if she is to establish her claim to innocence she must move her auditors. Aside from
                     such thematic continuities within the novel, this issue is likewise very much alive
                     in the poetry that Percy Shelley was writing contemporaneously, particularly in The
                     Revolt of Islam, where Cythna's eloquence is an important element in spreading political
                     and cultural enlightenment: see particularly Canto 8. </p>

                  <p>Mary Shelley knows from experience of what she writes. There were actually two such
                     huts on Montanvert above the Sea of Ice, one made of wood and erected by an Englishman
                     named Blair in 1779, and the other of stone constructed by a Frenchmen, Desportes,
                     in the year 1795 (Charles Edward Mathews, The Annals of Mont Blanc [Boston: L.C. Page,
                     1900]).</p>

                  <p>Not only does the Creature's terrible solitude remind us of the mental isolation into
                     which Victor Frankenstein finds himself plunged, but it also takes us back to the
                     original scene in which this narrative is being recited, upon a ship in the midst
                     of the Arctic Ocean, remote from either land or other human beings. As in Walton's
                     letters (Letter I and Letter II), so here one cannot fail to hear the echo of Coleridge's
                     "Rime of the Ancient Mariner": "Alone, alone, all, all alone,/ Alone on a wide wide
                     sea!" (line 232-3). </p>

                  <p>As earlier in his ruminations about language acquisition (II:4:9), the Creature unconsciously
                     adopts the exact phrasing of Victor Frankenstein (I:2:7) as he looks forward to his
                     education at Ingolstadt. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6619"><span class="term">I ardently wished to extinguish that life</span> 
                  <p>Heavy irony attends this choice of diction. Not only are we reminded of the "ardent"
                     desire with which, when young, Victor (I:2:7) (and Walton—I:L1:2) eagerly pursued
                     scientific knowledge, but we can associate with that innocent desire the more complicated
                     ardency driving Victor obsessively toward the scientific breakthrough that was the
                     birth of this Creature: see I:3:1 and note. This is the point in the novel when the
                     language of intense love first is used to embody the designs of a passionate hatred.

                  <p>It is a curious coincidence that the last time Victor called upon the heavens (I:6:22)
                     he instantly beheld his Creature. If Mary Shelley intended to signify something through
                     this coincidence, she certainly left no hint, and it has not been explained by commentators.

                  <p>The same characteristic has been the subject of our recent focus, as Victor's anguished
                     frustration in Justine's prison cell issues in this extraordinary physical reaction
                     (I:7:27). Earlier we witnessed the same phenomenon when Victor was brought aboard
                     Walton's ship (I:L4:10 and note), which, since it is an event almost contemporary
                     with his present narrative account must give us a sense of how habitual this reaction
                     has become; also how revelatory of psychological (and moral) disturbance it is. Two
                     other characters engage in the same passionate behavior: the Creature (III:3:13) and
                     Milton's Satan. </p>

                  <p>As has already been evident in earlier chapters, in Mary Shelley's perspective the
                     imagination is a power at once of great dynamic force and ethically neutral in its
                     operations, leading to good or evil ends depending on the psychological framework
                     in which it exists. The darker side of this mental attribute has been especially invoked
                     as events in the novel have taken a tragic turn: see, for instance, I:3:7 and note,
                     I:4:18 and note, I:6:27 and note. </p>

                  <p>The reader observes a carefully registered journey from the beautiful into the sublime,
                     from what Elizabeth has proposed as a domestic enclosure, warding off the unimaginable
                     and protecting the family unit from threat, into another confrontation, at least for
                     Victor, with elemental nature, with destruction and with fresh creation. The transitional
                     point of this rite of passage is marked by the village of St. Martin in the Shelleys'
                     account of their excursion to Chamonix in History of a Six Weeks' Tour. </p>

                  <p>The Creature's enforced loneliness has been physically brought home to him, but that
                     he should already conceive of himself at this early stage of his experience as flawed
                     seems to involve progress through social rejection to a new and not exactly liberating
                     stage of self-consciousness. </p>

                  <p>This is a nice detail in itself but not wholly devoid of further import. However boastful
                     the Creature may be about his advancement, the important point, and one that has been
                     slowly dawning on the reader, is that he is extremely intelligent. Like his "father,"
                     he is superior to his fellow-students (I:3:2). With his great stature, his exquisitely
                     fine feelings, and his mental quickness, he should have been equipped, in Victor's
                     early aspiration, to be a "new species" (I:3:8) of superhuman being. Instead, he has
                     been spurned. </p>

                  <p>Although Victor cannot know yet what is fully involved in his philosophical opinings,
                     the questions of what constitutes human identity and how humans may be free will turn
                     out to be major concerns of this second volume of the novel. As with the previous
                     sentence, Victor is here in the process of unconsciously setting the stage for a major
                     development in his education. </p>

                  <p>The Creature, who appears to educate himself by a process of progressive binary distinctions,
                     here broaches his master categories, nature and humanity, both of them, given the
                     season of his birth and the shock of his first human encounters, seemingly inhospitable
                     to him. </p>

                  <p>The Creature once again echoes the opening soliloquy of Byron's Manfred (1817) (see

                  <p>The Creature and Safie alike bemoan the conquering of native Americans of both the
                     Northern and Southern hemispheres by the various European imperial powers, who in
                     many cases reduced the natives to a condition of slavery. The Creature's emotional
                     identification with their fate is unself-conscious at this point, but the progress
                     of his education is leading him to understand an fundamental similarity with their
                     abjectness (see, for instance, II:9:5 and note). </p>

                  <p>There is a qualitative difference between this sense of injustice and what the Creature
                     has felt earlier. Here, after doing a good deed, he has been been judged undesirable
                     in a preemptive manner and physically punished. Thus, what festers mentally as well
                     as physically is that a simple action to save a life has been met with a violent,
                     life-threatening reaction from the larger society of human beings. He feels no longer
                     merely rejected by this world but actively menaced. </p>

                  <p>As he is superior to other human beings in stature and endurance, and finely tuned
                     both emotionally and intellectually, perhaps we should not be surprised at the sublimity
                     of the Creature's emotional outburst. Or, at least we should be no more surprised
                     than we are at the inarticulate ranting of Victor Frankenstein when they meet on the
                     Mer de Glace (II:2:6) or at the fury of Felix De Lacey (II:7:38), both of whom are
                     the products of cultivated families and refined educations. </p>

                  <p>In contrast to Victor, who through his intellectual obsession at Ingolstadt virtually
                     sequestered himself from both family and associates, the Creature, born into a natural
                     humanity, feels oppressed by his solitude. </p>

                  <p>As with the condescension to Justine's Catholicism (I:5:6, I:7:21), this ostensible
                     religious bias needs to be placed within the conventions of English publishing and
                     religious attitudes. It is unlikely that Mary Shelley herself subscribes to them.
                     Indeed, if in this chapter one reads in the attitudes of Turks to women some sense
                     of reflection on contemporary English attitudes, then, Mary Shelley would appear to
                     be playing something of her mother's game. And the mother-daughter relationship here
                     certainly testifies to that which Mary Shelley derived from the frequent perusal of
                     her mother's writings, an inculcation of ideals of independence on which, like, Safie
                     she was not afraid to act. </p>

                     the Creature's distinction is that Adam fell by knowingly commiting a sinful deed,
                     whereas Satan, in contrast, in this reading was intended to fall from heaven as an
                     intrinsic part of the conception of God's new creation. Most readers of Milton's epic
                     would not countenance a reading of Satan as more sinned against than sinning, but
                     it is the general interpretation that Percy Bysshe Shelley offers in the famous passage
                     of his "Defence of Poetry" devoted to the poem. Since that document dates from 1821,
                     five years after the beginning of Frankenstein, however well it glosses the antagonism
                     of Victor and his Creature, it ought not to be read in retrospect as explaining this
                     usage. One might, however, wish to argue that the representation in Mary Shelley's
                     novel either influenced her husband's interpretation or was worked out as a reading
                     in tandem with him. Whatever the case, the emphasis is unmistakeable here, that the
                     Creature sees himself as like Satan, "irrevocably excluded" from bliss, which—although
                     Milton (in Satan's soliloquy on Mount Niphates, IV.32ff.) tries to finesse the issue—is
                     how received theology forced him to represent the fallen archangel in his epic. </p>

                  <p>Whatever self-examination Victor undertakes, he cannot appear to see what the reader
                     does, that the same habitual obsessiveness regulates his thoughts, turned now, not
                     on a scientific experiment, but on the inner landscape of the mind over which he pores
                     with a customarily intense scrutiny. </p>

                  <p>Although the Creature here gains the bitter satisfaction of forcing Victor to confront
                     his own responsibility for having created a being of such surpassing ugliness that
                     he himself cannot bear his sight, at the same time this aggressive gesture imposes
                     the threat of his great physical power upon his weaker creator. It sharply emphasizes
                     the aesthetic problem he poses for human beings; but this gesture does not by any
                     means seem limited solely to that end. </p>

                     here again we are suddenly reminded that he is a newborn, signalling his wants by
                     crying. But, cast off by his creator and forced to make his way into the world in
                     utter solitude, his wants are so enormous that here we are perhaps intended by the
                     similarity of diction to recall the timbres of one of the most famous songs of exile
                     (Psalm 137) in the Western tradition. </p>

                     to speak (see II:4:9). After all the variants on the term, applied to and linking
                     the intellectual passions of Walton, Victor, and the Creature, the reader is hardly
                     prepared to encounter it here in its primary sense, as an expression of uninhibited
                     and undeflected sexual instinct. </p>

                  <p>From 1796, when Napoleon invaded Italy until 1814 when he was exiled to Elba, in fact,
                     most of Italy was either under the rule or the strong influence of France, and with
                     the restoration of the old monarchies in 1815, although the politics decidedly changed,
                     the French influence on Italy remained strong. Whether it would in either case have
                     involved extradition from Livorno of a non-French national might be questionable,
                     but the Turk's fears are not entirely groundless. </p>

                  <p>With telling artistic assurance Mary Shelley has the Creature, who up to this point
                     has referred to himself only by personal pronouns, name himself with the same word
                     originally used by Victor, "wretch" (I:4:3). Here, however, he defines himself as
                     what King Lear calls "the thing itself . . . unaccommodated man" (III.iv.100). Perhaps,
                     indeed, Mary Shelley means us to hear in the insistent repetition of the word "wretch"
                     the memorable accents of that unsceptered, sorrowing monarch: </p> Poor naked wretches, whereso'er you are,<br/> That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,<br/> How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,<br/> Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you<br/> From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en<br/> Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;<br/> Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,<br/> That thou mayst shake the superflux to them,<br/> And show the heavens more just.<br/> —III.iv.28-36</li>

                  <p>Here, as elsewhere in the novel, we sense some strain in Victor's relationship with
                     his strict father. Usually it is marked by his being recalled by a paternal admonition
                     to obligations that he has not met: see, for instance, I:3:10 and note; I:3:12 and

                     Walton that he had thought his creation beautiful until it was infused with life (I:4:2
                     and note) to some extent masked his original feelings. </p>

                  <p>Behind this utterance, one can hear what is truly the locus classicus, the classic
                     statement, of how one is impelled by exile to provide sympathetic assistance to other
                     exiles, that of Dido before the shipwrecked Aeneas: "Non ignari mali, miseris succerere
                     disco—Not ignorant of evils myself, I learn to succor the miserable" (Aeneid, I.630).
                     Without question Mary Shelley's educated readers would have heard the resonance of
                     this Latin tag, an allusion few women novelists of this time would have had sufficient
                     classical training to make. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6868"><span class="term">justice</span> 
                  <p>By this point in the novel, after two trials and an education in ancient and modern
                     political science, this word may be thought to carry large public as well as private
                     associations. But in this context they are theological as well, invoking the notion
                     of a theodicy (from Greek theou dike), a justification of God, which is Milton's announced
                     purpose for Paradise Lost: that is, to "justify the ways of God to men" (I.26). </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6875"><span class="term">justice</span> 
                  <p>Perhaps the Creature comprehends that is he talking to a person from a long line of
                     civic magistrates, or perhaps his plea has simply been predicated on their shared
                     Enlightenment discourse. Whatever the case, in his long narration he has consistently
                     been touching on the nerve from which he at last gets a response. For the first time
                     in his dealings with the Creature, from the original thought of his creation down
                     to this moment of moral decision, Victor acknowledges an abstract concept of the justice
                     owed him. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6882"><span class="term">justice</span> 
                  <p>This phrase is ambiguous: "fellow-creatures" in this contexts appears to be limited
                     to his family and friends. Later, Victor will revert to what he owes the human race
                     as a separate entity from the Creature, and justice will be construed quite differently.

                  <p>These exact words were uttered in the previous chapter when the Creature described
                     burning down the De Lacey's cottage (II:8:13 and note). </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e6897"><span class="term">This trait of kindness</span> 
                  <p>In the ongoing education of the Creature this is the point at which he is first able
                     to conceptualize that refinement of affection that constitutes kindness. As with much
                     of the ongoing development of his awareness, there is an ironic undertone here, however,
                     since he will never experience the sort of solicitude that, despite his poverty and
                     blindness, is the elder De Lacey's daily expectation and comfort. </p>
               </li>

                  <p>As was the case three paragraphs earlier, here the Creature evokes essential Enlightenment
                     values, twice privileging the notion of sympathy, but the affirmations are so hedged
                     as to be ominous. </p>

                  <p>A highly resonant shift of language. Elizabeth is forced back on intuition in the
                     same manner as Victor had been on his return to Geneva (I:6:25). Given the miscarriage
                     of justice perpetrated by those who convicted Justine on the basis of circumstantial
                     logic, Elizabeth's intuitive knowledge of the heart seems a preferable means by which
                     to organize—or to transcend—social institutions. And yet, the contrasting case of
                     Victor's passion for revenge would suggest how unpredictable, and even dangerous,
                     such a course might be. </p>

                  <p>Again, the Creature uncannily picks up on the timbres of Victor's meditations. Compare,
                     for instance, the first paragraph of this second volume (II:1:1), where Victor reviews
                     what he considers is a "blasted" existence. There his remorse (note) has much the
                     same deleterious and lasting effect that the Creature here attributes to knowledge.

                  <p>That is, the language spoken is German, not the French used by the De Laceys and the
                     Creature. This relapse appears to bear a symbolic connotation, as the Creature, who
                     had seen his efforts to acquire language as the key to his being accepted within human
                     society, is suddenly plunged once again into linguistic incomprehension. </p>

                     have a bonding effect, increasing his original attachment to her. In two months' time
                     the linguistic disadvantage that is a shared mark of their alienation is assuaged,
                     preparing them simultaneously for what should be a full social integration. </p>

                     modern German. Fortunately for the Creature, they have all been translated into French,

                  <p>This is the major departure from the 1818 text, indicative of Mary Shelley's wish
                     to keep her novel concentrated not on Victor's family relations, but, instead, on
                     the sense of abject isolation he bears in his psyche. Most critics who have compared
                     the texts prefer the appropriateness of this extensive shift of focus. </p>

                     English community of traders; hence the anglicized name. It would be a logical refuge
                     for someone looking to book passage to the eastern Mediterranean. </p>

                  <p>The Creature means that the story of Felix's efforts on behalf of Safie's father and
                     the ruination suffered by the De Laceys as a result have taught him how to manipulate
                     the judicial system. Thus, his framing of Justine Moritz is deliberate. There is a
                     further sense in which he has also framed the magistrate Alphonse Frankenstein to
                     become complicitous in a grave injustice, but that solid upright citizen is never
                     aware of it.</p> 
                  <p>A particularly brutal aspect of the "sanguinary laws of man" that the Creature did
                     not learn from Felix but has discovered on his own is how to victimize women. In the
                     1831 text (II:16:35) Mary Shelley stresses that Justine is framed because she represents
                     the type of Safie who fled in fear from his presence. In the revised text, then, the
                     planting of the picture is a symbolic form of rape. </p>

                  <p>Fittingly, as the curse Victor visits upon himself acknowledges his doubling in his
                     Creature, so here he essentially repeats the formulation—"miserable beyond all living

                     resonates as well for Victor, except that he is unable yet to see that his withdrawal
                     from basic human interaction, whether at Ingolstadt or after his return to Geneva,
                     has been the very act that has forestalled a true utility to his fellow beings. </p>

                     and note) leads him to a large political and social realm that is difficult for him
                     to assess. He is hardly the first to have such a reaction. This sentence resonates
                     with the same sense of frustration with the contradictions of the human condition
                     expressed by Byron's Manfred (Manfred was begun in the summer of 1816) in a similar
                     Alpine setting to that in which the Creature speaks. </p>

                     immediately to ensue. Yet, it may be intended to operate on a subtler level than just
                     that of forcing us and Victor to contemplate the truth of his relations with his Creature.
                     It is almost as if Victor's mental state, once he has been transposed into the sublime,
                     has transformed him, preparing him, unlike other members of his family, to look full
                     into the face of brute nature and experience at once its otherness and its symbiosis

                  <p>Percy Bysshe Shelley was passionately fond of boats. During the previous summer, which
                     he and Mary spent at Marlow near Windsor, he would drift in a small boat on the Thames
                     while he wrote. Mary, Claire, and he had a boat on Lake Geneva during the 1816 summer,
                     in which they sailed out most evenings. Later in the summer Byron and Shelley undertook
                     a two-week excursion by boat around the lake stopping at the various sites of interest
                     reachable from its shores. During this venture Mary Shelley stayed home to look after
                     her infant boy and write. </p>

                     sin with a strict causality: evil passions arise solely from a lack of sympathy. The
                     argument between them is scarcely academic, since these are the grounds over which
                     western criminology has been suspended for centuries. </p>

                     term just employed by Victor and transforms its signification. In effect, it is recast
                     as a term demanding the sympathy of any humane being, whether Victor or the reader.

                  <p>The Creature echoes his memories of his first day of existence (II:3:1), which may
                     suggest that, however much he has learned since, his essential condition as existential
                     being has not changed in the least. </p>

                  <p>In her customary way Mary Shelley plays on two meanings of the word. Victor uses it
                     in a derogatory manner, denoting the creature as inferior, but will be answered with
                     its meaning transformed as the Creature begins to recount his life of misery. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e7108"><span class="term">misery made me a fiend</span> 
                  <p>The Creature picks up the name Victor has just hurled at him and subtly recasts its
                     point. From the first Victor has looked upon his Creature as essentially depraved,
                     that is to say, evil in his very nature. The same issue hovers over the treatment
                     of Justine Moritz, particularly by members of the Frankenstein household, in Chapters
                     6 and 7 of Volume 1. The Creature's rejoinder is constructivist: which is to say,
                     that a sentient being is molded by material conditions. It is a position stoutly argued
                     by William Godwin throughout Political Justice (1793). In terms of contemporary criticism
                     of Frankenstein, this issue has a high visibility in all gender criticism. Beyond
                     literary criticism per se, the terms in which the novel casts this debate are highly
                     resonant for modern social and critical theory. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e7115"><span class="term">a mixture of pain and pleasure</span> 
                  <p>This is a step in the Creature's education, related to his encountering pain and pleasure
                     from a single source in fire (paragraph 6 above), by which he learns the complex doubleness
                     of emotional experience. Such ambivalent emotions, it is safe to say, were unknown
                     in prelapsarian Eden. </p>

                  <p>Like his brother, William immediately names the Creature as an outcast. If we take
                     the issue of family relationship seriously, however, we must realize that the Creature
                     is actually young William's nephew. </p>

                  <p>The echo here is pronounced. Only two paragraphs earlier Victor had recounted his
                     fear "lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate some new wickedness."
                     In Elizabeth's perspective, on the other hand, there is no alien being to consider
                     as a scapegoat and in whom to localize and therefore objectify evil. Instead, the
                     potentiality for monstrousness exists in all human hearts, and in their collective
                     aggregate that is human society, as Justine's fate demonstrates, this monstrousness
                     can be institutionalized as an underlying, unrecognized and therefore dangerous formation.
                     In other words, the monstrous is not external but within. </p>

                     Sea of Ice in a driving rain on 24 July 1816, then returned in better weather the
                     next day, leaving an account of their experiences in Letter 4 of A History of a Six

                  <p>Like his Creator, the Creature is highly conscious of rhetorical effect. By this locution
                     he may mean that he will now explain the ways in which his emotional involvement with
                     the cottagers intensified, but he is also setting a signpost for our own engagement
                     as readers with his text, as Victor has done before him (I:3:13) and will again attempt
                     to do after completing his narrative (III:Walton:4). Through his contemplation of
                     his effect, he raises anew the questions concerning truth and eloquence that are never
                     far from from the novel's surface. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e7157"><span class="term">multiplicity of sensations</span> 
                  <p>Mary Shelley posits the Lockean notion that at first one's natural condition is that
                     of synaesthesia, an indiscriminate intermingling of sense experience: only when the
                     intellect begins consciously to analyze sensory data are they broken down according
                     to the five diverse senses. The physiological basis for this development had been
                     posited in the mid-eighteenth century by the French materialist philosopher Condillac,
                     in his Traité des sensations. </p> 
                  <p>Deliberate synaesthesia is an artistic ploy often to be found among the English Romantic
                     poets, in none more than Percy Bysshe Shelley: see, for instance, his poem of 1818,
                     "Lines Written among the Euganean Hills," esp. line 285 ff. </p>
               </li>

                     themselves for my destruction</span> 
                  <p>Thus, the Creature explicitly remarks what the experience of Justine's trial and execution
                     had conveyed to Elizabeth, that men are universally "monsters thirsting for . . .
                     blood" (II:1:8). This is exactly antipathetic to the tenets of disinterested benevolence
                     Godwin had championed in his public writings (see Political Justice Book IV, Chapter
                     8 and elsewhere in that treatise) and in the instruction of his children. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e7174"><span class="term">mutability</span> 
                  <p>The third and fourth stanzas of Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem, "Mutability," published
                     in the Alastor volume in March 1816.</p> 
                  <p>The fairly conventional notions of her husband's poem seem at first to have little
                     direct linkage with the circumstances into which Mary Shelley has thrust Victor at
                     this juncture. But if one looks back over the landscape of the first volume, the operations
                     of mutability as a force of destruction are everywhere evident—from the fearsome movements
                     of sea and ice in Walton's letters, to the sudden deaths in the Frankenstein and Moritz
                     households, to the unmerited reversal of Justine's fortunes. But mutability is also
                     the very stuff of life. Perhaps then, most of all, the subject of the poem applies
                     to the scientific paradigms that govern the development of the volume—in ancient alchemy
                     (from the various transmutations it would apply to base metals to its search for a
                     means of suspending mutability itself in the elixir of life); or in modern chemistry,
                     which increasingly saw organic changes in terms of chemical transformations; or in
                     contemporary electrical theory, where dialectical tensions between opposing poles
                     were held responsible for the essential energy of life. A later poem of Percy Bysshe
                     Shelley confronts these ambivalences more subtly and more directly, embedding them
                     in a single symbolic force that is at one and same time both "Creator and Destroyer,"
                     the "Ode to the West Wind," written in 1819. </p>

                  <p>Here one begins to get a glimmer of the impact of Safie's arrival on the Creature's
                     thoughts, as he ponders his own need for a mutuality of feeling. The novel powerfully
                     demonstrates that where there are not such mutual bonds, a form of bondage is substituted
                     instead. Neither Victor nor his Creature is able to break away from the other, even
                     if all that holds them together is their antagonism. </p>

                  <p>The Creature's logic is direct and unambiguous, starting from a premise of obligation
                     that Victor had totally expunged from his mind. Continuing the process by which he
                     picks up on Victor's language and wholly recontextualizes it, now he asserts his right
                     to be considered in the place of Adam, not, as Victor had tried to cast him in the
                     previous paragraph, as Satan. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e7197"><span class="term">which would decide my fate</span> 
                  <p>The Creature's growing obsession with revealing himself to the cottagers may lack
                     an external instrumentation, but otherwise is of a piece with other obsessions in
                     the novel, both those of Walton and of Victor Frankenstein. His casting his future
                     in terms of destiny likewise echoes the discourse of the novel's other protagonists.

               <li class="item" id="d30e7204"><span class="term">my father</span> 
                  <p>The Creature at last names Victor as father, forcing upon his unwilling head the entire
                     range of cultural and literary associations that from his limited experience the term
                     might carry. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e7211"><span class="term">my form is a filthy type of your's</span> 
                  <p>There are occasions in this novel where the subtlety of the verbal patterning may
                     leave readers shaking their heads. The Creature, alluding to the journal in which
                     Victor describes the process of his creation, appears deliberately to echo the ugly
                     language with which Victor had earlier, in marked aversion, recounted that experience
                     to Walton. We are thus to suppose that Victor has been reusing phrases from that journal
                     in his narrative. For his "workshop of filthy creation," see I:3:9 and note. For his
                     further reference to the Creature as "the wretch, the filthy dæmon, to whom I had
                     given life," see I:6:22. At the end of this interview Victor will revert to the adjective
                     to characterize him once again (II:9:12), and the word then appears in the penultimate
                     sentence of the 1818 volume translated into nightmarish proportions (II:9:23). </p>

                  <p>At first sight this appears to be an evocation of the imagination more in line with
                     the normative practices of British Romanticism than earlier ones have been: the Creature
                     in his isolation takes refuge in an innocent, even utopian world of his own making,
                     one provided by the creative power of his imagination. This characteristic, almost
                     more than any other so far encountered in his educational process, testifies to his
                     fully human sensibility. From a more analytical perspective, however, such a refuge
                     of the creative imagination shares the main attributes of Victor's introverted retreat
                     at Ingolstadt, even to the point of opening the way to a sudden, disastrous reversal.

                  <p>The first definitions are of discrete things, which happen also to be the necessities
                     of life. The Creature's education places him in the condition of Adam, who named the
                     animals of Eden. See Genesis 2:18-20: </p> 
                  <p>Then the LORD God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make
                     him a helper fit for him."</p> 
                  <p>So out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of
                     the air, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever
                     the man called every living creature, that was its name.</p> 
                  <p>The man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every beast
                     of the field; but for the man there was not found a helper fit for him.</p> 
                  <p>The last phrase of the Genesis text we will soon see applies to the Creature as much
                     as it does to all of God's creation. </p> 
                  <p>Milton's litany of the creatures whom Adam named comes in his account of the Creation
                     in Paradise Lost, Book VII, 493ff. </p>

                  <p>Although Victor is thinking solely in personal terms, Johnson's 1755 Dictionary emphasizes
                     in a valuable way the social, and particularly the political, dimensions of this noun.
                     Given the fact that the novel will soon move directly to include such a framework
                     of human institutions, it is important to recognize that the Creature's perspective
                     on such diction might be quite different from, perhaps even more knowing than, Victor's.

                     self-reflexiveness about the nature of language and communication troubles the author

                     last chapter of Volume 1 (I:7:25). Not events per se, but their impact on characters'
                     perceptions give Mary Shelley's novel its dynamic momentum. In this focus on the integrity
                     of mental phenomena for good or ill—concerns likewise at this time governing the productions
                     of both Lord Byron (Manfred) and Percy Bysshe Shelley ("Mont Blanc" and Prometheus
                     Unbound)—one senses Mary Shelley's equal participation in the intellectual vibrancy

                  <p>For all Alphonse's attempt to console Victor, his being exactly wrong about the source
                     of Victor's grief must be indicative of some narrowness or shortsightedness of his
                     own. His son William is his only concern, and he assumes the same family priorities
                     for Victor; but Victor knows that Justine has been murdered, too, and that more than
                     tribal loyalty is at stake. That the father's commitment to the "public situations"
                     (I:1:1) in which he has passed his mature years extends so little into actual social
                     benevolence must in some sense affect how we take his counsel and assess his notion
                     of virtue. </p>

                  <p>Victor's habitual passivity reasserts itself with a sharp irony that reminds one of
                     the physical deterioration he suffered in giving life to his creation (I:3:9). His
                     argument is that the Creature, empowered by Victor with life, has so used that power
                     that it has robbed Victor of his own ability to act independently. </p>

                  <p>Given the novel's insistence on sympathy as an essential moral attribute of an individual
                     human being and a just society, Victor's drawing away so wholly from normative family
                     intercourse is an alarming event. That he is scarcely able to speak to his family
                     suggests a psychological condition that in modern parlance would seem to border on
                     psychosis. It is ironic that the Creature's passionate demand for an end to his solitude
                     should result in Victor's own recoil into a solitude almost as utter and just as fraught
                     with danger to himself and to others. </p>

                     a sentiment she shared with her father and husband. Perhaps, the true significance
                     of this statement, however, is the contrast it offers to the violent retribution Victor
                     would inflict on the Creature, whom, we must remember, he has as yet no evidence whatsoever
                     to connect with the murder of William or the framing of Justine. </p>

                     fearsome apparition in the nearby village, the reason is that they are, in their poverty
                     and separation, self-sufficient. They have no money to spend in that German community
                     and are likewise isolated from it by the fact that they appear to speak only French.

                     to which the Creature will resort if he is provoked: see II:2:7. Although its unethical
                     dimensions cannot be ignored, one should again remark how aptly congruent is the amoral
                     power Percy Bysshe Shelley saw embodied in Mont Blanc itself: see Shelley's "Mont

                     of the antagonistic course to which Victor has set himself. The primary verb of this
                     sentence ("tempt") assumes free will and moral responsibility as premises for all

                     tale at the age of nine and was passionately fond of romances (see I:1:11). </p>

                  <p>To a later reader accustomed to the 1818 edition or to the customary biographical
                     terrain of Mary Shelley's family associations, these phrases come with a sense almost
                     of shock. Even within the terms set by the novel itself they do not seem to ring true
                     to the general distance kept thus far between the characters and conventional religious
                     expression. The reader has the choice of construing this interpolation as a sign of
                     a shift in Mary Shelley's rhetorical palette to accommodate an early Victorian religious
                     sensibility (which has been asserted by some critics). On the other hand, this could
                     be interpreted instead as an attempt on her part to prepare us for the deep, if primitive,
                     religious faith that will eventually be invoked by Victor to sanction his single-minded
                     pursuit of revenge against his Creature. In other words, not all rhetorical alterations
                     portend changes in the author's own opinions. </p>

                     a second and striking context exists between these first memories and those of Adam

                  <p>This spring appears to wipe the slate clean for Victor in Ingolstadt as well (I:4:19).
                     For the Creature, no less than for Victor Frankenstein, however, the past cannot be

                  <p>The Creature here quotes back to Victor a line from Percy Shelley's "Mutability" that
                     Victor had mused over that morning in ascending Montanvert (II:2:3). Although this
                     does stretch the imagination, it is indisputably another instance of the mirror effects
                     we discern in the relations of Creator and Creature. </p>

               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e7499"><span class="term">pines</span> 
                  <p>Although we have no guide to Mary Shelley's thought processes as she wrote this passage,
                     it is probable that the stanza from Percy Shelley's poetry she quotes at the end of
                     the paragraph caused her to think of another from the volume in which it was published
                     (or the causality might have been reversed, with that other passage first coming to
                     mind and prompting the remembrance of this stanza): whatever the case, this description
                     of mountain conifers strongly resembles the desolate final scene, actually drawn from
                     Shelley's experiences in Wales before he met Mary, of his poem "Alastor" (see lines
                     550-70). An early sketch of this same subject is contained in a poem in the early
                     notebook known as the Esdaile Notebook, a poem Shelley wrote in 1811 and never published,
                     called after its first line "Dark spirit of the desart rude." </p> 
                  <p>On the other hand, the scenery of Switzerland, far more sublime than that of Wales,
                     afforded ample opportunity for Mary Shelley to observe the desolation that alpine
                     storms and glacial movement could visit on the pine forests of the mountains. There
                     is a description of such shattered trees in Letter 4 of A History of Six Weeks' Tour.
                     Byron offers another such passage in the second scene of Manfred, I.ii.66-74, which,
                     though begun later than Frankenstein, indicates at many points a common conceptual
                     origin. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e7508"><span class="term">Paradise Lost</span> 
                  <p>Paradise Lost, John Milton's epic poem, was originally published in 1667 in ten books,
                     then revised by its author into the twelve-book form in which we read it today shortly
                     before his death in 1674. Containing the major creation myth of modern Europe, its
                     impact on Frankenstein is major and discernible from beginning to end. In the immediate
                     context of the Creature's discovery rather than of Mary Shelley's intertextual conception
                     of her novel, however, what is most significant is how he reads the epic as a key
                     to his self-understanding, even perhaps his self-fashioning. </p>

                  <p>In England at this time a man without property had no vote: thus the very idea of
                     citizenship, of having a "stake" in the system, was tied to possession of property.
                     Of course, as the Creature will learn in the subsequent chapter, both Safie and the
                     De Laceys as exiles are also excluded from this polity, but they have family or friends
                     to rely on for support. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e7566"><span class="term">my protectors</span> 
                  <p>This is subtly touching diction: the Creature has convinced himself that he has mistaken
                     the De Laceys and recasts them in the role in which for many months he had conceived
                     them to act: see II:5:22 for his recognition that he has invented this appellation.
                     The De Laceys, of course, have never consciously done the Creature any good whatsoever.

               <li class="item" id="d30e7573"><span class="term">they will prove the truth of my tale</span> 
                  <p>Again, the creature seems to echo Victor Frankenstein (though, since Victor's narrative
                     to Walton postdates the Creature's by several years it is actually he who is engaged
                     in echoing). Wherever in the narrative nesting we look to find a foundation for its
                     truth, we discover both Victor and the Creature seeking to establish the evidence
                     that will verify their accounts and using almost identical language to do so. One
                     may thus compare this utterance with those of Victor to Walton at the beginning (I:L4:30
                     and note) and end (III:Walton:2) of his narrative. That the "evidence" comes from
                     the centrally embedded narrative, the story of Safie, is thus taken to lend credibility
                     to all narrative strands that subsume it. But, of course, these putative copies of
                     letters depend entirely on the Creature's word for their authenticity: so there is
                     actually no documentary foundation whatsoever for the "truth" of any of these fictions.
                     Still, it is indicative that Victor Frankenstein produces the letters to convince
                     Walton of his veracity (III:Walton:2). </p>

                  <p>Mary Shelley had herself to have been highly conscious of these attributes. Byron,
                     even if he inherited his title almost by accident, was a member of the House of Lords
                     and was always addressed as Lord Byron by the Shelleys. Percy Bysshe Shelley, although
                     somewhat down the hierarchical list of aristocracy, was the elder son of a baronet
                     and would therefore have expected to inherit the title of his father, Sir Timothy
                     Shelley. His family had an illustrious "descent," with Sir Philip Sidney being among
                     his ancestors. On the other side, however, neither William Godwin nor Mary Wollstonecraft
                     had any pretensions to lineage, and as middle-class radicals they were committed to
                     a classless society without false hierarchies. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e7602"><span class="term">rather the vast river of ice</span> 
                  <p>The correction reminds us that this glacier is itself in motion, simultaneously accumulating
                     new mass and at its lower edge melting, a pure example of the universal mutability
                     proclaimed in the poem just cited. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e7609"><span class="term">to reflect</span> 
                  <p>These reflections are of a very different character from earlier occasions where Victor
                     has used the term, so much so that a reader may feel some sense of disquiet over his
                     presumption in at last assuming the Olympian detachment of supervisory deity or parent.
                     Perhaps judgment on this level requires condescension, but the timbres of Victor's
                     father seem to resonate across this paragraph. </p>

                  <p>A remarkable difference exists, we must realize with something of a jolt, between
                     the Creature's silent meditations in his hovel and the sudden intrusion of a public
                     utterance of his conclusions from them. Insofar as it is hard for any reader to conceive
                     of such sentences as these ever being uttered by an actual human being, it testifies
                     to the unique existential extremity of the case he poses. </p>

                  <p>The Creature innocently echoes the language of Victor Frankenstein when he first conjectured
                     who was the murderer of his brother, one of the number of signs of their unconscious
                     affinity (I:6:28). </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e7630"><span class="term">revenge</span> 
                  <p>With characteristic understatement, Mary Shelley places the two cousins in total contrast:
                     Elizabeth through her sympathy attempting to assuage the pain Victor feels, and Victor
                     consumed by his hatred. As the reader would anticipate, it is Elizabeth who makes
                     the social gesture, "taking [Victor's] hand," and Victor who retreats into self-accusation.
                     As a tableau vivant this is a very illuminating scene. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e7637"><span class="term">as a right</span> 
                  <p>This is a distinction worth pondering. In general terms throughout the novel we have
                     been allowed to relax in the notion of sympathy as a private, even domestic virtue,
                     commensurate with compassion and affection. Questions of justice have been largely
                     raised within public arenas or as involving the legal rights of individuals. Here,
                     however, the larger issues of late Enlightenment democratic enfranchisement merge
                     with private desire, as to an important degree they also do in the Constitution of
                     the United States of America (1787), particularly as amended by the Bill of Rights
                     (1789), or the Declaration of Rights of the French Constituent Assembly (1789) or
                     that proposed by Maximilien Robespierre (1793) or, indeed, the radical Declaration
                     of Rights written by the young agitator Percy Bysshe Shelley for distribution among
                     the Irish in 1812. Sympathy thus has a political component to it. In the Creature's
                     formulation God, or one who would assume the supreme powers of God, implicitly has
                     an obligation to foster the "pursuit of happiness" of a creation or subject. </p>

               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e7651"><span class="term">Ruins of Empire</span> 
                  <p>Les Ruines, ou méditations sur les révolutions des empires (1791) by Constantin François
                     Chasseboeuf, comte de Volney (1757-1820) is one of the geniunely radical documents
                     produced in the early years of the French Revolution, a work that severely critiques
                     all the reigning ideologies of the world—whether political or theological—and proposes
                     their abolition. That the Creature should get his principal education into the institutions
                     of modern culture from such a profoundly antiestablishment work must have a significant
                     influence on his own subsequent distaste for human culture. But there is an ironic
                     side to it as well, for Volney's attempt to create the blueprint for the new revolutionary
                     man here falls on the ears of a uniquely revolutionary and wholly dispossessed individual.
                     The first English translation of Les Ruines, published as The Ruins, or a Survey of
                     the Revolutions of Empires (London: Joseph Johnson, 1792) was done by Godwin's close
                     friend James Marshall. Volney himself thought the translation too tame and in 1802
                     oversaw a new English version published in Paris, which was reprinted frequently and
                     became the standard conduit for his ideas throughout the English-speaking world. Among
                     those strongly effected by it was Percy Bysshe Shelley, whose Queen Mab shows considerable
                     debt to its ideas. </p>

                  <p>That the enterprizing Safie, who has managed to travel from Constantinople to Paris,
                     then to central Italy, and from there to this rural section of south-central Germany,
                     is so horrified attests to the intensity of fear aroused by the sight of the Creature.
                     That she deserts the entire family at this moment of crisis testifies to a primal,
                     irrational sense of self-preservation that is distinctly unGodwinian and stands as
                     an ironic counterstatement to all the Enlightenment ideals so accentuated in the paragraphs
                     leading up to this denouement. </p>

                  <p>Although Mary Shelley puts no extra emphasis on this point, still it is significant
                     that Safie, a woman with ambition and a mind of her own, is up to this point the best-traveled
                     figure in the novel. On some level of consciousness Mary Shelley must be aware of
                     her implicit links to Cythna, the liberated feminist heroine of Percy Shelley's contemporary
                     Revolt of Islam, published simultaneously with Frankenstein in 1818. </p>

                     in the universe, of being designed for alienation in the fulfillment of the Genesis.
                     This is, indeed, the ground upon which his colloquy with Victor Frankenstein began:
                     see II:2:7 and note. The Satanic prototype will extend, however, to the point of having
                     external not simply psychological ramifications: as Satan's only acts are reactions,
                     attempts to undo the perfection of God's universe, so the Creature will claim Victor's
                     attention by destroying what he most values. </p>

                     in 1816, when the Shelley party visited it that July, described in A History of a
                     Six Weeks' Tour, Letter IV. It was taken to be the very epitome of Nature's sublime
                     (and perhaps antihuman) power. </p>

                  <p>This not only makes sense in the context of the De Laceys' civilized demeanor, which
                     for many months now has served as the Creature's behavioral model, but also specifically
                     in respect to the elder De Lacey's explicit understanding of the dynamics of alienation
                     just witnessed in the Creature's night-time rampage. The use of political terminology
                     reminds us of the Creature's reading matter (particularly of the education furnished
                     him by Volney's Ruines), but also suggests that he still thinks it possible to negotiate
                     a place for himself within the human polity. </p>

                  <p>The self-deceit is, indeed, painful, since in his continual awareness that there is
                     no reality underlying his imaginings, the Creature testifies to the split existence
                     in which he lives. Here, the imagination is decidedly not a boon. </p>

                  <p>Whether or not this must necessarily be the case, it is a premise of Mary Shelley's
                     novel that normative aesthetic categories are, indeed, the instrument for ostracizing
                     the Creature from all human society. </p>

                  <p>As is manifest in the previous chapter (see I:7:13 and note), for Victor remorse has
                     a physical and mental effect akin to that of poison. Already worn down constitutionally,
                     Victor will feel its debilitating effects from this point forward. </p>

                  <p>Although this is an important plot device by which the Creature is allowed to advance
                     in his education, it is more than simply that. What the Creature in his enforced solitude
                     thought of as a "godlike science" (II:4:9) and "the art of language" (II:4:18) is
                     an acquisition essential for his claim to true humanness. As Safie is enfolded by
                     the De Lacey family through acquiring their language, so, the Creature hopes, he can
                     likewise break down the barriers of Otherness in which he is compelled to live. If
                     language has up to now been used as an instrument for his self-knowledge (note), with
                     Safie's arrival it will become the actual means by which he will endeavor to secure
                     a place in a human community. </p>

                  <p>The crucial place of language in the Creature's education and in his growing sense
                     of identity is a significant sign of the importance Mary Shelley attaches to it as
                     a professional writer and, however herself inexperienced at the age she began the
                     novel, as the child, wife, and associate of other major authors of the age. And yet
                     it is always shadowed by the dark irony of another "monster" accorded the use of language,
                     Shakespeare's Caliban, who tells Miranda: "You taught me language, and my profit on't/
                     Is, I know how to curse" (The Tempest, I.ii.363-64). </p>

                  <p>The shutting of these gates at the time of Victor's return to his family home (I:6:19),
                     it will be remembered, allowed for his midnight sighting of his Creature. The same
                     precaution also necessitated Justine Moritz's passing the fateful night of William

                     being first defined as the actual embodiment of the sublime landscape out of which
                     he emerges. Taller and stronger than any normal human being and created out of the
                     essential dynamic forces of nature, he seems deliberately to embody the Power that
                     Percy Bysshe Shelley located in the mountain itself: </p> 
                  <p>. . . awful scene,<br/> Where Power in likeness of the Arve comes down<br/> From the ice-gulfs that gird his secret throne,<br/> Bursting through these dark mountains like the flame<br/> Of lightning through the tempest.<br/>("Mont Blanc," 15-19)</p>

                     from the south. It is scarcely appropriate to the region of Mont Blanc, but, if one
                     reads the reference generically to a violent storm, that is probably all that Victor
                     means. </p>

                     operates as a signal testimony to his unambiguous humanity and his inner capaciousness,
                     carries an increasingly ironic import where no one else will acknowledge his claims

                     of her novel, Mary Shelley makes us realize how deeply internalized as psychological

                  <p>In his brief course of reading the Creature has encountered a surprising number of
                     examples of alienation, martyrdom, and victimization. These are states, however uneviable
                     they may be, that at least testify to social and political relationships. His solitude,

                     murdered his brother, Theseus his father, and both were likewise violent toward women.
                     The Creature thus testifies to his essentially pacific nature and his admiration for

                  <p>The Creature's imagery tends to be poetic and generally, as is the case here or in
                     his description of Safie's singing three paragraphs before, where he compares her
                     to a nightingale, his imagery is drawn from nature. In his temperament he seems, interestingly,
                     to be something of a cross between Elizabeth, with her love of nature, and Clerval,
                     with his refined poetic sensibility. Victor, of course, does not intrude upon the
                     narrative he is recounting to note such linkages nor, indeed, the irony of the internal
                     delicacy of the figure he so brutishly names. </p>

                     depart Eden (XII.646-49). That the Creature speaks in these elegiac tones suggests
                     that, for him, this is the moment in which he can no longer define himself, as he
                     did in his appeal to the elder De Lacey (II:7:26), as a being of innocent and benevolent
                     disposition. A second Adam, he has experienced his fall. </p>

                  <p>The issue of self-control that has been an undercurrent throughout this volume here
                     near its end surfaces as an important component of its pattern of complex ambivalences.
                     Even as such discipline appears a principal aim of the emphasis on education, it also
                     directly counters the natural values elsewhere generally honored. </p>

                  <p>However unthreatening such language may sound today, in 1818, with England racked
                     by unrest and governed by reactionaries, these were what we might today call fighting
                     words. They certainly signaled the anonymous author's radical sympathies to readers—and
                     reviewers. This is the point in the novel where discerning readers, not knowing who
                     the author was, would comprehend the significance of the dedication to William Godwin,
                     whose Enquiry Concerning Political Justice of 1793 remained the most radical analysis
                     of "the strange system of human society" for the generation of his daughter. This
                     work, rather than the more tempered redaction of 1798, when the extreme antiestablishment
                     perspective of the original might have been taken for treason, in many respects underlies
                     the Creature's sense of alienation, his understanding of the structured injustice
                     that allows him no place in human society, and his recognition of endemic restraints

                     he is not part of the human family, places it within another and more pernicious construction.
                     In effect, he is internalizing a sense of profound alienation, becoming the Other

                     appears to gloss the psychological operations the Creature is experiencing in this

                     It is not a superficial kindness or momentary expression of compassion, but an essential
                     aspect of what it is to live as a human being, a necessity. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e7966"><span class="term">My papa is a Syndic</span> 
                  <p>The capacity to name, or abuse by naming—and to judge, or misjudge—are intimately
                     allied throughout this novel. This is even truer of the stance one takes to the object
                     of naming and judging. As William confidently assures the Creature, his father has
                     been accorded the power to punish by this society: William adopts the same tone and
                     attitude of natural superiority. Perhaps it was implictly present from the family
                     expectations underscored in the first sentence of Victor's narrative (I:1:1) as well.
                     Given the emotional chords that have resonated from William's death for eleven chapters
                     and the epithets with which he has been honored ("little darling William" by Elizabeth
                     [I:5:7], "that sweet child . . . who was so gentle, yet so gay" by Alphonse [I:6:3],
                     "dear angel" by Victor [I:6:25]), his sheer childish nastiness surprizes us and, though
                     it does not justify his murder, makes the Creature's bumbling attempt to quiet him
                     comprehensible. </p>

                  <p>A family reduced to this level of poverty would be unlikely to afford candles, which,
                     generally speaking, in the eighteenth century were among household luxuries. A peasant
                     in the northern part of Europe would be most likely to burn rush—dried reeds—for light.

                  <p>The logic of desire is played out through this paragraph to such an extent that, in
                     the abstract at least, the answer to the question is already implicit in the disparity
                     the Creature feels between himself and the De Lacey household. The thirst for perfection
                     and incumbent awareness of personal inadequacy is a theme often encountered in the
                     poetry of Lord Byron (e.g. Childe Harold's Pilgrimage Canto 4, 122ff.) and Percy Bysshe
                     Shelley (e.g. "Lines Written among the Euganean Hills") during this period. </p>

                     fell overboard and sank to the bottom of Lake Geneva, from which he had to be rescued.
                     Speculative biography has discovered an urge toward suicide in the event and has connected
                     it with these ruminations of Victor's. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e7995"><span class="term">signification of those terms</span> 
                  <p>Here one senses the imprint of Godwin's method of progressively discriminating the
                     necessary components of abstract ethical concepts. Virtue, and to a less degree vice,
                     are repeatedly used as markers for social justice in the Enquiry concerning Political
                     Justice, whose extended title continues as "and Its Influence on General Virtue and
                     Happiness." Particular attention is paid to these concepts in Book I, Chapter 3 ("The
                     Moral Characters of Men Originate in their Perceptions"), Book 4, Chapter 6 ("Inferences
                     from the Doctrine of Necessity"), Book 4, Chapter 8 ("Of the Principle of Virtue"),
                     Book 4, Chapter 9 ("Of the Tendency of Virtue"), and Book 5, Chapter 2 ("Of Education").

                  <p>This phrase carries a significant freight. Although it might be read as one more occasion
                     in which Victor yields up his distinctive identity, substituting an obscure destiny
                     in the process of fulfillment for his innate responsibility for events, in fact this
                     necessity is driven by his own remorse, which is so acute that it can never be assuaged.
                     Although he seems unaware of what he is doing, he is actually claiming responsibility
                     for that destiny. </p>

                  <p>The modern descriptive term for Victor's experience would be awesome. Although he
                     dwells on how satisfying is this kind of response to nature (and in the third edition
                     it is particularly accentuated), it is probably so because of its reliable alterity
                     from his own situation. In a few paragraphs, with startling irony, he will have that
                     dependability rudely broken, and the sublime will come directly home to the human
                     who, thinking to master it, had fled from its tremendous power. </p>

                  <p>This recognition confirms how tellingly on the mark the Creature had been in earlier
                     confronting Victor with the habitual language of his father (II:2:7 and note). </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8023"><span class="term">the fiend</span> 
                  <p>This is a new term for the Creature, in its extremity indicating how far beyond "all
                     bounds of moderation" (as Victor puts it in the next paragraph) his hatred has carried
                     him. He will repeat it, virtually like a mantra, in that ensuing paragraph. </p>

                  <p>Although Victor continually flagellates himself for the deaths of William and Justine,
                     yet the hardening of his language as a means of self-exculpation and displacing his
                     guilt continues. As he interchanges "fiend" and "monster," he combines the diabolic
                     and the unnatural to objectify and distance his Creature from the norms he accords
                     his family. </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8037"><span class="term">the wretch</span> 
                  <p>Victor reverts, as if by instinct (or psychological regression), to the nomenclature
                     in which he first invested his Creature on that dreary November night some twenty-one
                     months earlier when he brought him to life: see I:4:2-3 and note.</p>

                  <p>Since this noun and its derivatives tolls like a bell through the novel after it is
                     first used by Victor to name the Creature (I:4:3), there is a very real sense, on
                     a linguisitic plane, in which the condition is already broadly shared. </p>

                  <p>It is now early spring, the first spring for the Creature, and he observes its characteristics
                     without any previous example for comparison. The reader, however, already has experienced
                     Victor's transports over this "divine spring" (see I:4:19 and note) in the first volume
                     of the novel. </p>

                     learns what it is to enjoy a full humanity is erotic love. That Felix responds so
                     wholly to her presence as to seem physically transfigured perhaps underscores the
                     emphasis the Creature will hereafter place upon the creation of a mate that may, he
                     might hope, in some small part have a similar effect on him. </p>

                  <p>As earlier, Victor's histrionic sputtering, even as it testifies at once to the explosion
                     of long repressed emotion and to his incapacity to handle the situation with which
                     he is suddenly confronted, is also revelatory on a conceptual level. His mind is totally
                     bound by the binary opposition of God and Satan in which he assumes not just creative
                     godhead but also the right of judgment and particularly that of damnation, appointing
                     this "fiend" and "devil" to the "tortures of hell." </p>

                  <p>Only at this point, at the end of the chapter, do we become aware that the Creature
                     has, up to now, no ability to relate linguistically, that he is still operating on
                     the non-verbal level of the sparrows and thrushes whose sounds he first discriminated
                     (paragraph 4 above). Although presumably the De Lacey family speaks during the ongoing
                     business of the day, except for the "few sounds" (paragraph 14 above) that were uttered
                     by the young man outside the cottage and by the old man when his music elicited tears,
                     this account is, as it were, rendered against a backdrop of total silence except for
                     the interlude of music. Mary Shelley's artistic refinement in rendering this silence
                     intensifies, in contrast, the importance of words and of communication for the world
                     of her novel. </p>

                     amiable platitudes concerning "brotherly love" (paragraph 25 above). Even worse, it
                     undercuts all the ideals for which Felix has stood as well as the intellectual command
                     by which he has restored his family's happiness and tranquillity. In a pinch Volney's
                     ideal of an open, accepting humanity gives way to an unthinking recidivism, a protective
                     and brutal tribalism, a masculinist belligerence, that is the moral equivalent of
                     war. </p>

                     its circumstances—from involvement of the elder De Lacey and Agatha, who had no part
                     in Felix's machinations, to the five-month pre-trial incarceration, to the confiscation
                     of the family fortune and their banishment—suggest an arbitrary and tyrannical abuse

                     made Victor into a new being. In a curious way, by recognizing what it is to be God,
                     he becomes more like the sober and fearful Adam setting out from Eden at the end of
                     Paradise Lost, a moral being for whom, as the Creature himself has acknowledged in
                     reference to Byron's Manfred (II:5:18 and note, II:7:10 and note), knowledge is commensurate
                     with sorrow. </p>

                     order. It is not a pleasant discovery to find oneself a discordant presence, but,
                     as the ensuing paragraph relates, a kind of natural logic helps this eight-foot anomalous
                     being not to feel himself divorced from the natural order. On the contrary, he seems
                     instinctively able to recognize his affinity with it, even down to what he shares
                     with beings as tiny as sparrows. </p>

                     on the early nineteenth-century stage, in England and across Europe, so there is another

                     a certain class bias from entering her discourse. In the case of Alphonse Frankenstein
                     (I:6:36 and note) this may be something of a key to his character; but the Creature's
                     emphasis on gentility after six weeks of existence might seem ill-conceived to some
                     readers. It would appear, however, that the author is trying to suggest the Creature's
                     own natural gentility rather than an innate snobbery in him. </p>

                     present scene, we must recall, takes place not in the hovel attached to the De Lacey
                     cottage, but rather in a hut above the Sea of Ice on Mont Blanc. It is here, fittingly,
                     that the Creature, another blank slate, lives removed from humanity and where he appeals
                     to his creator for identity, to be written upon. </p>

                     valley of almost a week from 21 to 27 July, 1816, while Mary was deep in the writing
                     of her novel. A long description of the excursion, written by Shelley to Thomas Love
                     Peacock, was included in A History of a Six Weeks' Tour (see Letter 4). </p>

                     it is likewise an indication of how close to subsistence exists this entire family.
                     In this they share the condition of the Creature who attaches himself to them partly
                     on the basis of their simplicity of manners and means. </p>

                  <p>With pointed economy Mary Shelley returns to the context of Paradise Lost, once again
                     to emphasize the disparity between God's accomplishment and that of Victor Frankenstein.
                     This time it is centered in the figure of Eve, who is transfixed by her beauty when,
                     newly born, she happens to catch sight of her perfect form mirrored in a pool (IV.449-88).
                     In both the novel and epic, though the effect is differently pointed in each, we read
                     ironically against Ovid's account of the myth of Narcissus in Book III of the Metamorphoses.

                     "violent gesticulations." Now Felix is seized by what is clearly an instinctive and
                     uncontrollable violence. This is the same youth who, inspired by the most noble motives,
                     has been habitually called "gentle" by the Creature in earlier chapters. </p>

                  <p>These lines, repeated by the Creature to Victor, apply directly to his conduct, indicting
                     his lack of both foresight and responsibility. They are also sadly ominous of the
                     further degree of alienation faced by the Creature if this present mission fails.

                  <p>The Creature acknowledges his fall from an original state of grace: "virtues" seems
                     to be deliberately Miltonic diction, invoking Satan and Adam (and Eve). The Biblical
                     context aside, this claim to a prelapsarian perfection is intended to remind Victor
                     of his own high ambition (see I:3:8) and to affirm how well, on an internal if not
                     external plane, it was realized. </p>

                  <p>This is the Creature's first observation of human society rather than the life of
                     nature, and it does not exactly accord with our normative sense of the civilized.
                     Yet, a wandering beggar himself, he accepts this without wondering why it should be,
                     leaving that question to the logical instincts of a reader with greater command over
                     social institutions. </p>

                     father's persecution (II:6:3) and the De Laceys' ruination (II:6:14), and he may have
                     gleaned something of its underlying assumptions from William Frankenstein's instinctive
                     reliance on his father's ability to punish arbitrarily (see II:8:27 and note). Yet,
                     it is to Victor that the Creature speaks, and, since he has used a derivative of "wantonness"
                     in his earlier condemnation (II:8:1 and note), it is perhaps to that particularized
                     sense of irresponsibility that he reverts here. </p>

                  <p>Even to be able to ask the question suggests the extremity of alienation in which
                     the Creature exists and the extent to which he internalizes the values by which normative
                     human culture rejects him. The "then" is a significant index of the force of logic
                     that excludes the Creature from a recognizable place in the world. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e8285"><span class="term">Sorrows of Werter</span> 
                  <p>Die Leiden des Jungen Werthers (The Sorrows of the Young Werter) by Johann Wolfgang
                     von Goethe (1749-1832) was originally published anonymously in Leipzig in 1774. Almost
                     instantly it became a best seller, catapulting its young and unknown author into fame
                     and a major literary career that would span more than half a century. By the end of
                     the decade the novel had been translated into the other European languages, attaining
                     a pan-European success that continued well into the nineteenth century: as late as
                     1892 it afforded Jules Massenet one of his greatest musical triumphs at the Paris
                     Opera.</p> 
                  <p>The first French translation was published in 1777 as the work of C. Aubry, a pseudonym
                     for Friedrich Wilhelm Karl, Graf von Schmettau (1742-1806), and it was frequently
                     reprinted in that language. The first English version, by Daniel Malthus, was published
                     in 1779 as The Sorrows of Werter, using the French text, rather than Goethe's original,
                     as its base. </p> 
                  <p>The novel coincided with what has come to be known as the Age of Sensibility, whose
                     flames it helped to fan. It is an epistolary novel, told in Werther's voice and from
                     his perspective, and there is little in the way of plot. Charlotte, the oldest of
                     six children, is left an orphan by the sudden death of her mother, and she marries
                     the sensible, if somewhat plodding, Albert as a means of holding the family together.
                     Onto the scene comes the young student Werther who is befriended by the couple but
                     then falls passionately in love with Lotte. His infatuation progressively deepens
                     to a point of desperation in which he commits suicide. The novel was said to be responsible
                     for making suicide fashionable among the young men of Europe.</p> 
                  <p>What the Creature responds to are less the episodes of the plot or even the dynamics
                     of infatuation than the sense of moral emptiness that Werther finds in the world and
                     from which he turns for refuge to the somewhat maternal Lotte. Precociously intellectual
                     with a late-adolescent intensity, Werther too seeks to understand his identity and
                     to discover his place in a middle-class milieu that cares for little that is not prudent
                     and sensible, the world represented by Albert. In reference to the particular dynamics
                     of Mary Shelley's novel, this milieu would appear very much on the order of the temperate
                     Swiss world of Alphonse Frankenstein and Henry Clerval's father. Thus, curiously enough,
                     the novel establishes a link to Goethe's fiction both through the intense self-questioning
                     and bleak alienation of the Creature as well as the obsessive behavior of his creator
                     Victor Frankenstein, who also turns away from the commonplace Geneva expectations
                     in which he was raised to fathom a new mode of being. </p>

                  <p>The Creature turns from Goethe's novel of isolated sensibility, where he sees his
                     own reflection (and we to some extent see Victor's) to contemplate the public and
                     civic models of Plutarch's biographical accounts, engaging a world of social interaction
                     and nation-building of which he has no experience whatsoever. Thus the accounts draw
                     him forth from his own isolation to imagine a larger cultural sphere of action in
                     which he might participate. </p>

                  <p>That the Creature proposes to make a virtue out of necessity and embrace his alienation
                     as a mode of existence indicates what two years of experience have cost him. The pathos
                     of this declaration does not call attention to itself, but is all the more affecting.

                  <p>Elizabeth's faith that a retreat from the world would allow the two of them a relief
                     from the buffeting of experience is understandable, if sadly ill-placed. The ensuing
                     chapters seem deliberately designed to test this hope both in their exemplary tale
                     of a collective retreat (involving not just the DeLacey's and Safie, but the Creature
                     as well) and in the very fact that, themselves taking place in an almost inaccessible
                     retreat, they present Victor Frankenstein with a moral crisis of a kind he has never
                     known and is unprepared for. </p>

                     That they are unanswerable has larger implications than for just him. They contribute
                     to the exploratory tonalities of a novel that resists easy answers and unambiguous
                     truths. </p>

                  <p>Elizabeth's comparative innocence does not allow her the larger perspective held by
                     the reader, who might want to apply the force of these words to the accruing series
                     of contrasts between herself and Victor being offered by this paragraph. In his lack
                     of candor, justice, and sympathy, Victor appears specifically to negate the virtues
                     of Elizabeth, who stands here as something of an emblem for truth itself. </p>

                  <p>A lengthy pattern of self-analysis and attendant self-alienation is implicit in this
                     passage. The Creature's divorce from himself is linked to the imagery of doubling

                  <p>The repetition of "boundless" language from the previous chapter (see II:1:6 and note)
                     emphasizes the point that Victor is, as ever, too "ardent," unable to moderate or
                     even control his reaction. Whereas some earlier critics wished to enforce a facile
                     dichotomy between Victor as rationalist and his Creature as the exemplar of sensibility,
                     a passage like this reminds us of how little power Victor's capacity for abstraction
                     actually has over the broad field of his mind.</p> 
                  <p>The Creature, as his narrative unfolds, will likewise represent himself through similar
                     language as he experiences what he conceives to be a betrayal by his "adopted" family,
                     the De Laceys. At that moment (II:8:12) in his recital he seems unconscious of the
                     close similarity between the two of them. </p>

               <li class="item" id="d30e8357"><span class="term">without being able as yet to understand or apply them</span> 
                  <p>That the Creature has as yet no notion of how words that define feelings can be applied
                     suggests that the next stage of his education must be metaphysical, involving an understanding
                     of the self and an exploration of self-consciousness. For him this will necessarily
                     entail what Byron called "Consciousness awaking to her woes" (Childe Harold's Pilgrimage
                     1.941: st. 92). </p>
               </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8364"><span class="term">the wretched</span> 
                  <p>"Wretch" is the first term Victor applies to his Creature (I:4:3), as well as his
                     appellation for him at his reappearance in this chapter. It is apt that the creature
                     thus picks up this resonant word and by shifting its form alters its meaning. For
                     her debut as a novelist Mary Shelley adopts a daring and difficult but brilliantly
                     successful strategy, keeping the Creature out of sight for most of Volume I while
                     Victor heaps terms of abuse on his felt presence and renders him for the reader the
                     monster he is wont to call him. The urbane calm of the Creature's opening statement,
                     "I expected this reception," is a startling reminder of just how much Victor, in his
                     narration of his story, has skewed the perspective on its events. In effect, the Creature
                     takes the opportunity of his finally being heard to rename, to reconceptualize, himself.
                     And the reader is left hanging in doubt—perhaps, even distrust—about rendering a verdict
                     from having listened only to one side of the case. </p>

                  <p>As the Creature's terms have just implicitly placed Victor Frankenstein with the judges
                     who have wrongfully condemned Justine Moritz to death, so here, he recognizes that
                     Victor's easy willingness to commit murder, broached in the preceding chapter (II:1:6)
                     and reiterated to the Creature himself (II:2:6), places him on the same moral plane
                     as the being he accuses of having committed murder. If Victor does not yet recognize
                     his identity with his creation, the Creature's plea is reinforcing their "ties" on
                     every level possible. </p>

                     echoed from the mouth of his Creature. In a world about to be turned upside-down,
                     it would not be surprising if Victor's putative son were not in some odd sense to
                     assume the role of his father. </p>

                  Cottage from Wordsworth in 1809. Percy Shelley and his first wife Harriet had visited
                  the region for several weeks in 1811, where they made the acquaintance of Southey
                  and held long literary and political talks with him of the sort indicated here. This
                  context might be indicated by the fact that it is Clerval in particular who is attracted
                  to the region and his new acquaintance there. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8400"><span class="term">actuated by selfish and vicious motives</span> On the face of it, Victor's honest admission that he has been impelled by less than
                  disinterested motives must raise him in the reader's estimation, especially since
                  he is close to his death and seems to be struggling for a truthful objectivity. Yet,
                  a second glance at this phrase calls for its positioning, and we realize that Victor
                  is referring to the last paragraph of his narration (III:7:26), uttered on 26 August,
                  not three weeks before. If the last paragraph of his account is so indelibly tainted
                  as Victor admits, what are we to think of what has preceded it? In other words, by
                  what has his entire narration been "actuated"? If the whole rests on nothing but "selfish
                  and vicious motives," then the textual indeterminacy so continually hinted at throughout
                  the novel may in fact be radical. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8407"><span class="term">addressed me in French</span> For the third time in these Irish chapters (see III:3:29 and III:4:11) Mary Shelley
                  emphasizes a multiple perspective associated with shifts in language. To some extent,
                  she must be reinforcing our awareness of an essential affinity between Victor Frankenstein
                  and Mr. Kirwin in matters of class and education. Yet, even as she evokes common bonds,
                  she subtly reminds us of the differences that are lost in translation or that, on
                  a larger scale, represent features by which we distinguish ourselves from others.
                  </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8414"><span class="term">the affections </span> In these late frames Victor's ramblings tend to touch on themes represented early
                  in the novel and subsequently rather shunted to the side by the pressure of events.
                  Thus, Victor's underscoring of the domestic affections as the arena for human life's
                  most cherished actions reflects the nostalgic view of his childhood expressed in his
                  first chapter (I:1:9, I:1:11) and strongly reinforced by his bitter recriminations
                  over his withdrawal from this arena at Ingolstadt (I:3:12 and note). That the novel's
                  actual focus is rather the opposite has been remarked more than once by critics. Certainly,
                  the ultimate value of what on the surface appear to be peaceful domestic affections
                  is thrown into question by the behavior of the cottagers to the Creature in Volume
                  2 (II:7:36) or the scapegoating of Justine conducted by the pious burghers of Geneva
                  in Volume 1 (I:7:13). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8421"><span class="term">Again do I vow vengeance </span> The sudden time shift into the present tense makes us realize how isolated from reality
                  is Victor's conception of the universe. But, likewise, the religious overtones of
                  this reiterated "vow," combined with Victor's sense that he is an instrument of divine
                  retribution, must alert us to the irony by which the two beings, linked in a closed
                  circle of revenge, are anything but redemptive in their endeavors. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8428"><span class="term">my agony was still superior to thine </span> The Creature's language recalls the diction of Victor Frankenstein's curse on him
                  in the cemetery of Geneva where the Frankenstein family was interred (III:7:5), to
                  which he responded with a "loud and fiendish laugh." This retrospective perhaps explicates
                  that laugh; at the very least, it indicates that the agony Victor had wished upon
                  him then was already the abiding condition of his existence. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8435"><span class="term">I allowed . . . moment </span> 
                  <p>The oddly cavalier attitude toward grave matters pronounced just before in Victor's
                     interview with his father (III:1:8) appears to deepen here. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8444"><span class="term">I almost felt . . . being </span> The "almost" by which Victor separates himself from moral responsibility contrasts
                  sharply with the strength of his verb emphasizing sheer brutality. This language is
                  commensurate with the burst of passionate violence in which he tore to pieces the
                  second being on whom he had labored (III:3:4). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8451"><span class="term">almost as imposing and interesting as truth </span> For a person of Walton's scientific pretensions, this is a remarkable phrase. As
                  with other statements in these paragraphs, it bears a poised ambiguity in its significance,
                  both justifying the super-natural as a realm of imaginative vision and casting doubt
                  on its actual efficacy. Truth is, after all, here an unmodifiable standard by which
                  all visionary comparisons are to be judged. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8458"><span class="term">I am quite alone </span> This image of existential solitude is the final allusion of the many in this novel
                  to Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, "Alone, alone, all, all alone" (line 232). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8465"><span class="term">An eye so full of lofty design </span> Admittedly, the reader will not wish to take such a phrase out of its context, nor
                  wholly discount how impressed Walton himself is by his friend's intervention on his
                  behalf. Yet at the same time the ambivalence in diction that has surrounded the functioning
                  of eloquence since Walton resumed the narration (III:Walton:1, III:Walton:6 and note,
                  III:Walton:12 and note) calls attention to this further instance of the double-entendre.
                  "Design" may be a synonym for "purpose," the word Walton stresses just below, at the
                  end of this day's entry; but it may also bear a sense of calculated histronics. The
                  linguistic ambivalence allows Walton and his readers, should they wish, to derive
                  opposite conclusions from the same evidence. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8473"><span class="term">the anguish of recognition </span> 
                  <p>The phrase is suggestive of something beyond the mere identification of the body.
                     Victor surely recognizes his responsibility for this death. Perhaps the extremity
                     of his phrase is also intended to accentuate the point at which he finds himself looking,
                     as it were, into a mirror, confronting a second self who has been murdered by a being
                     who is likewise an extension of himself. The shock, as his reaction strongly testifies,
                     is psychologically as well as physically convulsive.</p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8482"><span class="term">an apoplectic fit </span> 
                  <p>The OED defines apoplexy: </p> 
                  <p>A malady, very sudden in its attack, which arrests more or less completely the powers
                     of sense and motion; it is usually caused by an effusion of blood or serum in the
                     brain, and preceded by giddiness, partial loss of muscular power, etc. </p> 
                  <p>In modern parlance, this would be termed a cerebral hemorrhage. It is not certain
                     that the term was applied so specifically in Mary Shelley's day. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8495"><span class="term">I thought of Switzerland . . . appalling landscape </span> This description, though clearly conditioned by the rugged and mountainous islands
                  to which Victor has retreated, is even more appropriate to the realm of transgressive
                  power in which his scientific obsessions are centered. Whenever the sublime erupts
                  in Frankenstein, the reader may expect its avatar, Victor's Creature, to make an appearance
                  as well. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8502"><span class="term">appearance of the simplest truth </span> The emphasis on Victor's theatricality in the previous paragraph has insinuated the
                  question of exactly where the truth may lie in Victor's account. Although Walton concentrates
                  on the possibility that Victor's tale could be a complete fabrication, for the reader
                  convinced of the Creature's existence this language also underscores the larger issue
                  of the relativity of any individual's perception of the truth. The Creature's take
                  on this story, as Walton will himself learn, is rather different from Victor's. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8509"><span class="term">the apple had already been eaten </span> Victor here construes himself in terms of the fallen Adam, by his transgressive actions
                  forever barred from Paradise. The angel whose "arm [is] bared" is the figure Blake
                  called "the Covering Cherub," assigned to make certain that no return was possible:
                  it is to be assumed that by this figure Victor identifies his Creature as an instrument
                  of divine destiny. 
                  <p>See also Milton's description of this banishment in Paradise Lost, XII.632-44. </p> </li>

                  <p>The network of subtle allusiveness that has quietly identified Victor Frankenstein
                     with Milton's Satan in Paradise Lost here rises to the surface of the text. Victor
                     refers specifically to the climax of Satan's soliloquy on Mount Niphates:</p> 
                  <p>Which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hell; <br/> And, in the lowest deep, a lower deep <br/> Still threatening to devour me opens wide, <br/> To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven.<br/> (IV.75-79)</p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8538"><span class="term">They were for ever ardent and craving </span> In the connotations of Mary Shelley's time, this phrase, in combination with the
                  "impotent passions" described two sentences earlier, would seem to suggest that the
                  Creature has suffered deeply during his existence from unconsummated sexual desire.
                  Ironically, his desire for intercourse has been pure and unsublimated, whereas that
                  of Walton and Frankenstein has been strongly channeled away from human interaction
                  and into their respective projects (see II:9:9 and note). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8545"><span class="term">ardent desire </span> The resonaces of this phrase for both Victor (see I:2:7), his Creature (see II:5:7
                  and III:Walton:43), Walton (I:L3:1), and even the beneficent Mr. Kirwin (III:4:20)
                  are another indication of how carefully Mary Shelley, in this final chapter of Victor's
                  narration, is engaged in marking thematic unities across the various levels of her
                  fictional panorama. "Ardent desire," though if untempered it can lead to a solipsistic
                  irresponsibilty, is nonetheless an essential human principle. Its abrogation here,
                  which will be reinforced by Victor's repetition of this disclaimer in his last moments
                  (see III:Walton:28), indicates how whole is Victor's reversal from the student who
                  undertook his career at Ingolstadt because he so "ardently desired the acquisition
                  of knowledge" (I:2:7). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8552"><span class="term">Embraced her with ardour </span> After the numerous uses of this word to express a passion deflected upon mental objects
                  and self-destructive withdrawal from community (see II:1:6 and its omnibus note),
                  it is almost shocking to have it at last, and ironically, function within its normative
                  connotations: that is to say, to represent passionate love. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8559"><span class="term">ardently prayed </span> The language of ardor, earlier associated with the scientific pursuits of both Walton
                  (I:L1:2, I:L3:1) and Victor Frankenstein (I:3:2, I:4:3)—where in the latter case it
                  is tinged with something approaching the eroticism only fully expressed after the
                  death of Elizabeth (III:6:9)—is here transferred into the arena of hatred. In Victor
                  this hatred will constitute a passion as intense and single-minded as erotic infatuation.
                  </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8566"><span class="term">ascertain my fate </span> From the retrospect of later chapters in the novel this seemingly innocuous phrase
                  might be seen as constituting something of a floodwater for what will become an increasingly
                  powerful, inescapable driving force in Victor's comprehension of the world. At the
                  conceptual core of this notion of destiny one finds combined, as here, a sense of
                  his own incapacity to act independently, a passivity before what he construes as superior
                  power, and an abnegation of responsibility for the actions of himself or others. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8574"><span class="term">mine is assigned to me by heaven </span> Victor's assurance of transcendental authorization for his murderous intentions has
                  become so absolute that he never questions his aims or how they are thus assured.
                  Unlike Walton and his crew, he is locked into a vision as rigid and unmoving as had
                  been the icefield surrounding the ship. When it breaks apart, offering an escape to
                  a renewed, living community, Victor chooses to revert to the closed and solitary circle
                  of his vengeance. That decision insures, indeed, is virtually the equivalent of, the
                  death that forestalls his further pursuit of the Creature. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8581"><span class="term">assizes </span> The Oxford English Dictionary, in its twelfth subsection under the substantive "assize,"
                  explains these courts of trial as follows: The sessions held periodically in each
                  county of England, for the purpose of administering civil and criminal justice, by
                  judges acting under certain special commissions (chiefly and usually, but not exclusively,
                  being ordinary judges of the superior courts, or, after 1875, of the Supreme Court).
                  It was provided by Magna Carta that the judges should visit each county once every
                  year to take assizes (i.e. try writs of assize) of novel disseisin, mort d'ancestre,
                  and darreine presentment (so that the jury who constituted the Grand Assize . . .
                  might not be obliged to travel from remote corners of England to appear in court at
                  Westminster). Thence the names assizes, and justices or judges of assize, still retained
                  by these circuit courts and itinerant judges, after their judicial functions had been
                  greatly extended in various directions, especially in that of the trial of felonies
                  and offences. Assizes were abolished by the Courts Act, 1971; their criminal jurisdiction
                  was transferred to the Crown Courts. Of course, Ireland in the eighteenth-century
                  had not yet been joined administratively to the mechanisms of the United Kingdom as
                  it would become with the Act of Union of 1801. But in practical effect the nominally
                  independent country, in its administration of justice, modeled itself on the English
                  system. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8588"><span class="term">I might be driven into the wide Atlantic </span> Victor's hyperbole is characteristic of his imagination, which, whether leading him
                  to create a being of abnormal stature or to envision a succesion of horrific torments
                  he might suffer, is always larger than life. The remark does, however, prepare us
                  for the extraordinary distance he does, indeed, travel. </li>

                     in the chronology (compare III:1 in both 1818 and 1831). The expedition to Mont Blanc
                     took place "about the middle of August" (II:1:10), but then upon Victor's return,
                     as this chapter opens by recounting, "Day after day, week after week passed away"
                     (III:1:1) in listlessness. </p> </li>

                  19th, noting that Victor will begin his tale the following day. Thus, Victor's long
                  narrative, which constitutes the bulk of the novel's three volumes and spans many
                  years and all of Europe, has occupied a mere six days of the fictional time frame.

               <li class="item" id="d30e8618"><span class="term">avoided . . . any encounter </span> Victor's regaining a sense of community through the influence of Clerval's letter,
                  as he represented himself three paragraphs earlier, seems far from certain. His shying
                  from contact with his fellow humans has become virtually instinctive. That he refers
                  to the fishermen by the generic term "creatures" is instructive, since it separates
                  them to a marked degree within the same generic category as the being whom he created.

               <li class="item" id="d30e8625"><span class="term">the award of justice </span> In the course of two trials and even in his final deposition to a Geneva magistrate
                  Victor is exonerated from reponsibility for any criminal activity. Thus, this "award"
                  is one that, in Victor's mind, exists beyond the checkered course of human justice.
                  In a fine irony, it is only moments before he narrates the events of a trial from
                  which he easily secures his release that Victor indicates to Walton that he has brought
                  himself to the bar to be condemned. </li>

                  <p>The state of Victor's conscience is borne out by the perturbed dreams that, as he
                     will report in the last paragraph of this chapter, continually afflict him in sleep.</p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8641"><span class="term">and I be alone? </span> The faintly Biblical language in which the Creature speaks is actually derived, and
                  it would seem significantly so, from Milton. The vocabulary reflects the scene in
                  which Adam names the various, already-mated species of animals, then asks God why
                  he should himself be left in solitude. See Paradise Lost 8.389ff. and 8.594. In context,
                  then, the Creature is telling Victor that he has broken the contract that God had
                  made with Adam. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8648"><span class="term">beautiful in nature . . . sublime . . . of man </span> At this point it is clear that it is Clerval, "the image of [Victor's] former self"
                  (III:2:3) who retains this responsiveness to his natural surroundings. This is exemplified
                  in the previous chapter with his enthusiastic reaction to the Rhine valley (III:1:19).
                  His citing of both the beautiful and the sublime in this sentence may point the reader
                  less to Victor—who sees himself no longer able to respond fully to either—than to
                  a sense of inclusiveness, at once aesthetic and intellectual, that Mary Shelley seems
                  to be associating with a fully realized human being. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8656"><span class="term">be men </span> The echo of Lady Macbeth's denunciation of her husband's vacillation before the murder
                  of Duncan is unmistakable, and, like the earlier allusion to Inferno 26, provides
                  an ironic subtext that undercuts Victor's histrionic oratory: Macbeth Prithee, peace:
                  <br/> I dare do all that may become a man; <br/> Who dares do more is none. Lady Macbeth What beast was't, then, <br/> That made you break this enterprise to me? <br/> When you durst do it, then you were a man; <br/> And, to be more than what you were, you would <br/> Be so much more the man.

                  in his enraptured vision of the "new species" that would owe its existence to him
                  (I:3:8). That Victor should here repeat that term of distanced scientific taxonomy

                  <p>This spa, a neoclassical structure in the form of a circular temple, was erected on
                     the Water of Leith in the 1790s. Black's Picturesque Tourist of Scotland, 18th ed.
                     (Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, 1869), describes it in these terms: The well (or
                     pump-room as it might be called) stands close on the banks of the river, immediately
                     below the Dean Bridge. The water is an excellent sulphureous liquid, possessing the
                     usual medicinal qualities, similar to those of the Moffat, and Harrogate. The late
                     Lord Gardenstone was the first to appreciate the properties of the spring, and erected
                     the present classical temple enclosing a statue of Hygeia, whose face very properly
                     'is expressive of sympathy and kindness.' (78) </p>

                  near Bellerive: "I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed" (I:1:22). His premonition
                  of the destructive power of the vital force he would employ for creation here realizes

               <li class="item" id="d30e8755"><span class="term">The blue Mediterranean appeared </span> Victor has followed the entire course of the Rhône from the point at which it flows
                  out of Lake Geneva through Geneva and eastward into France; there, confluencing with
                  the Loire at Lyons, it turns south, to exit into the Mediterranean at France's major

               <li class="item" id="d30e8762"><span class="term">the blue seas of the south </span> Victor's remark reminds us that this pursuit of the creature has gone on steadily
                  in a great crescent from Marseilles across the length of the Mediterranean Sea, through
                  the Dardanelles and across the Black Sea, and then north through Russia and even,
                  perhaps, Siberia to the edge of the Arctic Ocean. This is a major geographical exploration
                  for a man without an expeditionary force. Even more is it an ordeal for his Creature,
                  who leads the way across the wilderness without any human intervention to help or

                  begins to close with his Creature. That Mary Shelley expects her readers to sense
                  some measure of perverse, almost abstracted eroticism in this "burning gush" might
                  be inferred from her continual employment of the language of desire throughout the
                  novel (for instance, the various forms of "ardour" and "ardent" she marshals with
                  such skill) and the curious vacuum where one might anticipate passion in the relation
                  of Victor and Elizabeth. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8786"><span class="term">that burning hatred, and ardent desire of revenge </span> If it is really true that these striking oxymorons, in which hatred is expressed
                  in the language of love, no longer impel Victor, they do reinforce the passionate
                  cast of his diction in the last chapters of his narration (III:7:22 and note). The
                  word "ardent" likewise reminds us of the use of that word to describe the obsessiveness
                  with which he labored to bring his Creature into existence (I:3:1, I:3:9). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8793"><span class="term">they had called me mad </span> Just nine months before Elizabeth's death Victor, after the discovery of Clerval's
                  corpse, had fallen into a delirium lasting two months (III:4:11). Even, after he had
                  regained his reason, his ranting convinced his father that he remained truly deranged
                  (III:5:5). The constant threading of this issue through the novel must remind Mary
                  Shelley's readers that they are wholly at the mercy of this autobiographical narrative
                  embedded in her text, a narrative told by a man introduced as "generally having an
                  expression of wildness, even madness" to him (I:L4:10). It is more than possible that
                  this is exactly her point, that Victor has been slowly descending into a madness from
                  which there is no escape, and that with his descent the narrative becomes increasingly
                  unreliable. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8800"><span class="term">I called myself the murderer </span> Although occuring within a delirium, this is, perhaps, the most open, revelation—even
                  if it is subconscious—of how deeply Victor identifies with the being he created. There
                  would seem, as well, to be a self-awareness of responsibility that, when he is in
                  his senses, Victor represses. </li>

                     in the 1818 text between himself and Dante's hypocrites should reveal (II:9:22 and
                     note). On the other hand, as was highlighted in Volume 1, it is distinctly one of
                     Elizabeth's virtues (I:6:41 and note). </p> </li>

               <li class="item" id="d30e8832"><span class="term">at the entrance of the cemetery </span> In a macabre irony Mary Shelley brings Victor back to the kind of scene with which,
                  as a student in Ingolstadt, he was well familiar, now to contemplate the unlooked-for
                  consequences of his earlier grave-robbing in the destruction of his family. The sudden
                  reappearance of his Creature in such a location—the type, as it were, of the bed on
                  which he was conceived—is perversely appropriate. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8839"><span class="term">greater claims to my attention </span> Victor seems to refer to the reasoning that brought him to suspend work on the female
                  companion to his Creature (III:3:1). Yet, this present rearticulation of his thinking
                  revises the terms used earlier, substituting what appears to be a distinction between
                  natural and unnatural life forms, or at least between a majority and minority class,
                  that many readers would find invidious because inherently racist. Again, if this is
                  to be construed as an attempt at honest reassessment, the strained casuistry hints
                  at a slanted self-exoneration. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8846"><span class="term">my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment </span> With a subtle touch Mary Shelley emphasizes Walton's similarity to the Victor Frankenstein
                  who, two paragraphs earlier, had been unsure whether he could rid his mind of its
                  "passion," that is, self-interest in its own affairs. The principal cloud overshadowing
                  Walton is the failure of the entire enterprise to which he has been committed for
                  a number of years. The death of Victor has also robbed him of the only deep friendship
                  he has known. On professional and personal planes, then, he is equally bereft. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8853"><span class="term">Cologny </span> 
                  <p>Cologny, Switzerland, lies on the southern side of Lake Geneva. It is the site of
                     the Maison Chapuis, the house that Mary and Percy Bysshe Shelley rented during the
                     summer of 1816. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8863"><span class="term">the progress of European colonisation </span> Scholars have debated how to construe this addition to the 1831 text of the novel.
                  Given Clerval's seeming representation as a Shelleyan ideal, his desire to attach
                  himself to the imperialist designs of Europe upon Asia would appear to have Mary Shelley's
                  endorsement. And it should be said that this early in the growth of the British empire—long
                  before the Afghan Wars (1839-42) and the Indian Mutiny (1857-59)—when the liberal-minded
                  Sir William Bentinck was Governor-General (1828-35), the British saw their influence
                  in the Indian subcontinent as morally benign. Still, the extent to which the imperial
                  "native" is debased within this system has its corollary in the rejection of the Creature
                  by Europeans wherever he encounters them. Likewise, earlier imperial projects are
                  roundly condemned elsewhere in the novel: for instance, by Victor and by the Creature
                  himself in his reaction to the reading of Volney's Ruins of Empires. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8870"><span class="term">the commission of a dreadful crime </span> As with the language with which he earlier speaks of these "remains," Victor's skulking
                  hesitation suggests that, however morally blameless he represents himself as being,
                  in his deep consciousness he recognizes the similarity between his un-creative act
                  and murder. (See III:3:4 and note; III:3:22 and note). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8877"><span class="term">Come on, my enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives </span> Indicative either of Victor's own deliberate reinterpretation of the Creature as
                  his double in rewording the "inscriptions" left for him, or of the symbiotic way in
                  which the Creature through the experience of revenge now sounds like a second self
                  of Victor's, this phrase recalls the masculinist bravado Victor twice indulges in
                  his impotent rage before the power of the Creature (see II:2:6 and III:3:16). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8884"><span class="term">commanded his countenance </span> The connotations of this verb, along with the panoply of described emotions surrounding
                  it, forcefully indicate Victor's awareness of the effect he has had on his audience
                  over the previous six days. Walton's language, however, coming immediately upon his
                  assuming what purports to be a narrative objectivity, seems intended to have an even
                  more pronounced effect on the larger audience of Mary Shelley's novel. Where Walton
                  may feel he is experiencing an authentic emotionality, we in our greater detachment
                  may wish instead to discern in Victor's recounted autobiography an accomplished actor's
                  knowing manipulation of his subject matter and his audience. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8891"><span class="term">the tenderest compassion </span> In the see-saw effect of her characterization of Victor, Mary Shelley returns to
                  the side of his character that Walton finds most attractive. In an existential void
                  himself, one created as much by his own chosen withdrawal from social obligations
                  as by the pressure of catastrophic events, Victor is still able to sympathize with
                  the plight of Walton and his crew and to offer encouragement to their hopes. Perhaps
                  what would most easily explain this sympathetic posture, though it would not justify
                  the optimism he expresses to them, is Victor's own deep sense of helplessness before
                  an implacable force. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8898"><span class="term">composing draught </span> Literally, a drink to quiet one. "Composing draught" is the common term used in the

               <li class="item" id="d30e8905"><span class="term">many of my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave </span> These deaths once more testify to the contingent and threatened nature of human life
                  in Frankenstein. The fact of such mortality is surely what exacerbates the crew's
                  sense of its peril and justifies its appeal to the captain to cut short his expedition.
                  Although Walton expresses no guilt for the fate of these mariners under his command,
                  one might wonder at its lack. Certainly, it is an odd paradox that the novel can concentrate
                  with such intensity on the murderous consequences of the antagonism of Victor Frankenstein
                  and his Creature but pass by without comment the revelation that Walton's enterprise
                  in pursuit of knowledge has resulted in apparently greater death than has their destructive
                  dynamic. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8912"><span class="term">I concealed . . . father </span> Increasingly, in this volume, Alphonse Frankenstein seems incapable of living with
                  the actual state of the world beyond his enclosed family circle—and in this case,
                  he seems even unable to discern what is going on within it. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8919"><span class="term">the voice of conscience </span> Walton reveals just how much he has learned from listening to Victor's narration,
                  which is to say, how much we have likewise learned from reading the novel. Confronting
                  the Creature with a stern morality but also with compassion, Walton attributes fundamental
                  human characteristics to him, insisting on his humanity and thus on his obligations
                  as a human being. The Creature responds in kind, enumerating even more complexly shaded
                  human attributes as fundamental to his constitution. This process of dynamic self-examination
                  through human interchange may also be seen as a new element in his experience, eliciting
                  a sense of self not as an alienated, and therefore unique and unaccountable, being,
                  but as a sharer in emotions and social duties common to the human race. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8926"><span class="term">in continuation </span> At this moment of Victor's desparate exhaustion and extreme isolation, Mary Shelley
                  tellingly reasserts the centrality of human continuity and connectedness. Her sudden
                  reassignment of the role of narrator, from Victor to Walton, also alters its assumed
                  audience. A ship's captain listening to the solitary voice of a dying refugee in the
                  Arctic wilderness shares in that sense of impacted solitude. In contrast, the vicarious
                  experience of Walton's sister, who is addressed directly in the next sentence and
                  who presumably will read this transmitted account in London, takes place at the heart
                  of human civilization. This inserted tag may have a second function as well, that
                  of reinforcing the question posed in the last paragraph of Victor's narrative, whether
                  Walton will honor his plea and continue Victor's obsessive pursuit of the Creature.
                  </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8933"><span class="term">corrected and augmented </span> The question of narrative truth is here given a sudden new twist. As readers over
                  the course of nearly three volumes containing Victor's narrative, we have come to
                  assume that it is a straight-forward account, unmediated by another voice. Now we
                  are forced to recognize that what we have read in this simple understanding has been
                  twice edited, first by Victor, and then by Walton acting at Victor's behest. What
                  Walton first wrote has in its second draft not only been "corrected," but "augmented,"
                  added to, leaving us with the uncomfortable feeling that mistakes could still survive
                  in the text, or that they could have been accidentally or—much more worrisome—deliberately
                  introduced in the process of editing, or that further areas for augmentation might
                  still exist that, if properly elaborated, might materially change the focus of our
                  perspective. In other words, Mary Shelley, having just merged two distinct narrative
                  voices and their respective audiences, now further destabilizes her text as an embodiment
                  of a fixed, immutably true account of its personalities and events. Our knowledge
                  is indeterminate and relative, wholly dependent on those voices that filter it. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8941"><span class="term">his countenance . . . treachery </span> A reader cannot miss how without basis is this "reading" of the Creature's facial
                  expression. Victor has neither seen nor spoken to him for an entire year since their
                  encounter on the Sea of Ice. Moreover, throughout the progress of the second volume,
                  in the humanization attendant upon the Creature's autobiographical account, we had
                  gradually lost sight of his objective physical deformity. Here, we are thrust back
                  into an "objectification" that is so extreme that it allows Victor to relinguish all
                  sense of humane obligation or fellow feeling. The self-righteousness that accompanies
                  this distancing is perhaps to be expected. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8948"><span class="term">I could not collect the courage </span> 
                  <p>When one examines the chronology of this novel, Victor's inaction or procrastination
                     or incapacity, however one denominates it, almost seems more its impetus than his
                     earlier obsessiveness. After a six months' illness at Ingolstadt, Victor spends an
                     entire year doing almost nothing there (I:5:15). Urgently recalled to Geneva by William's
                     death, he is stopped for two days when he reaches Lausanne by a sense of undefined
                     dread (I:6:14). Although he is certain of Justine's innocence, he is incapable of
                     doing anything to support it and watches her trial and execution in helpless frustration.
                     There ensues, as the first sentence of the second volume indicates, a "dead calmness
                     of inaction and certainty" (II:1:1) from which Victor is roused by the expedition
                     to Mont Blanc. In all, this trip takes just four days, and he returns from it to his
                     family "passive to all their arrangements" (II:9:22). The way in which a sort of psychotic
                     trauma wholly blocks the ability to act is likewise a major theme of Byron's Manfred
                     (1817), which also grew out of the Geneva summer of 1816. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8957"><span class="term">their courage would return </span> When they were hired on, the crew was specifically described as being "certainly
                  possessed of dauntless courage" (I:L2:1). It is, of course, possible that Walton was
                  wrong in his original estimation, or that the ordeal through which they have passed
                  has sapped the men of their bravery. But it is also possible that Walton, driven by
                  an obsession with a purpose to which he has devoted years and a small fortune, has
                  misinterpreted the caution with which these seamen view the continuance of their mission.
                  Twice in his early letters to his sister (I:L2:5, I:L3:3), Walton assured her that
                  he would "do nothing rashly." His crew may simply be holding him to that promise.
                  </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8964"><span class="term">creator </span> In this phrase one hears an undertone, faint if ironic, of which Victor is wholly
                  unconscious. There is another "existence" in the novel who is just as wholly dependent
                  "on the life of its creator," though Victor, as here, ignores the imperative posed
                  by his Creature and his own obligations to his creation. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8971"><span class="term">a criminal judge </span> Although time easily becomes blurred in this novel, the reader should remember that
                  it is actually less than two-and-a-half years since the miscarriage of justice that
                  resulted in Justine Moritz's execution. That Victor, who on that occasion condemned
                  the entire criminal magistracy of Geneva (I:7:14), should now repair to one of them
                  to justify his own murderous pursuit of his Creature underscores the intellectual
                  distance he has traversed in the intervening months, as well as the extremity of his
                  current mental state. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8978"><span class="term">the county-town </span> A trip of these dimensions could get Victor and Mr. Kirwin to some half dozen county-towns
                  in the north of Ireland where, presumably, Victor landed his boat. The present size
                  of Ulster, Northern Ireland, is in the range of 100 square miles. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8985"><span class="term">Cumberland and Westmoreland </span> Cumberland and Westmoreland are the counties comprising England's Lake District,
                  at the point of Frankenstein's publication famous for having been the site of a school
                  of distinguished poets, foremost among whom was Wordsworth, who settled at Dove Cottage
                  in Grasmere in 1799. When he transferred a few miles south to the more commodious
                  Rydal Mount a decade after, Thomas DeQuincey moved in to Dove Cottage. In this day
                  the Lake District, as celebrated as it was for its unspoiled natural beauty, was probably
                  the remotest area of England. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e8992"><span class="term">a mixture of curiosity and compassion </span> If Victor Frankenstein's dying injunction carries a weight equivalent to that of
                  the law, what suspends Walton's obedience to it are attributes of our human constitution
                  that, for good or for bad, actively resist a rigid legalistic construction. The law,
                  which has persecuted both Justice Moritz in volume 1 and Victor Frankenstein in volume
                  3, is accorded no special privilege by this novel; but on the other hand curiosity,
                  which has led Walton to endanger the lives of his crew (I:L1:2) and Victor to be blind
                  to the consequences of his scientific obsessions (I:7:1 and note), seems deliberately
                  to have been accorded a bad repute by Mary Shelley. Yet, for the author so to link
                  it with compassion is to suggest an ethical likeness underpinning the two. 
                  <p>This similarity between sympathy and intellectual inquiry resonates as well in other
                     writings of Mary Shelley and her husband. A central passage of Percy Bysshe Shelley's
                     "Defence of Poetry" succinctly outlines the dimensions of this similarity and suggests
                     why its terms might matter so deeply to these writers. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9001"><span class="term">senseless curiosity </span> This phrase represents another instance of the complexity of verbal resonance we
                  encounter late in Mary Shelley's novel. It was, as Victor Frankenstein himself acknowledged,
                  curiosity about the Creature he pursued (I:L4:11) that first animated the interest
                  of Walton and his crew. In the very beginning Walton had characterized his driving
                  passion as an "ardent curiosity" (I:L1:2), and it is this trait that most obviously
                  links him with the obsessive scientific pursuits that Victor early on associated with
                  the realm of the "lawless" (I:7:1). Yet, it is the same trait that compels Victor
                  to listen to the Creature's naration (II:2:16) below Mont Blanc and that will restrain
                  Walton from attacking him (III:Walton:38) upon his reappearance in the final pages.
                  Thus, what leads to an antisocial solipsism can also be an instrument for transcending
                  rigid barriers and reestablishing social relationships through sympathy. The strongly
                  oppositional ways in which curiosity functions in the novel may suggest that this
                  most human (and Romantic) attribute is inherently neither good nor bad, but is merely
                  an instrument, neutral in itself, that should never be dissociated from our common
                  "sense" of the ends it pursues. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9008"><span class="term">I was cursed by some devil, and carried about with me my eternal hell </span> To what sort of devil can Victor be referring? Is it what, exonerating himself from
                  responsibility, he described to his father as "some destiny of the most horrible kind"
                  (III:4:41)? Or is it a more immediately relevant sense that the world of the dead,
                  which in the previous paragraphs he has seen as impelling his mission of revenge,
                  has a fundamentally diabolical association (III:7:5)? Or is it that he knows himself
                  to be self-curst, as he earlier surmised at the beginning of the second volume (II:1:1)?
                  Such an admission would involve acknowledging that the "devil" is an internal spirit.
                  Certainly, the continuation of the sentence suggests such a recognition of the diabolical
                  as a psychological state, for it returns us to the conclusion of the first volume,
                  where Victor confesses that upon the execution of Justine Moritz he "bore a hell within
                  [him]" (I:7:30). Once again, the context is supplied by Milton's Satan as he reviews
                  his career in soliloquy on Mt. Niphates (see Paradise Lost, IV.73ff.). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9015"><span class="term">the daemon </span> Such nomenclature has been absent from the novel since early in the second chapter
                  (see, for instance, II:2:7): from this point on, Victor resorts increasingly to this
                  term, which increasingly lends his Creature a larger-than-life, fantastic presence
                  in his mind and in the representation of him. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9023"><span class="term">a daemon </span> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9030"><span class="term">a dæmon </span> Such dehumanized nomenclature is becoming Victor's standard term for his Creature.
                  </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9037"><span class="term">when you . . . danger </span> Compare with this the stanza quoted from Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner"
                  to characterize Victor's precipitous walk the morning after the Creature came to life
                  (I:4:7 and note). Victor's sense of helplessness, which will soon reach an extremity,
                  becoming transformed into a catatonic physical state, will increasingly dominate the
                  novel's late events. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9044"><span class="term">The threat appeared more as a delusion </span> So heavily ironized has become Victor's existence by this point in the novel that
                  he can entertain a notion of a wholesale inversion of reality without remarking on
                  the distortion. The return to an actual reality will come, we can be sure, with a
                  devastating finality. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9051"><span class="term">deserts and barbarous countries </span> As elsewhere in the novel (see III:3:1 and note) and in accord with contemporary
                  usage, "desert" here means any wilderness. In classical references the land of the
                  barbarians is generally construed as Scythia, which is the far interior of Russia.
                  Fittingly, then, it is to that exact geographical region that Victor will pursue the
                  Creature. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9058"><span class="term">deserts </span> The term is a generic locution for an area uninhabited by humanity (see II:2:13 and
                  note). Thus, the Creature's plan to seek "the vast wilds of South America" is compatible
                  with this meaning. 
                  <p>Compare the OED:</p>1. An uninhabited and uncultivated tract of country; a wilderness: . . . b. formerly
                  applied more widely to any wild, uninhabited region, including forest-land.

                  <p>DESERT. n.s. [desertum, Latin.] A wilderness; solitude; waste country; uninhabited

               <li class="item" id="d30e9080"><span class="term">my demoniacal design </span> As "design" had an ambiguous sense in its recent application to Victor (III:Walton:18
                  and note), so here the reader is brought short by the Creature's assertion that his
                  series of acts have been freely willed. The very adjective he employs embodies an
                  internalization of Victor's demonization of him. Although he certainly bears responsibility
                  for his acts through an abiding remorse, at the same time we are aware that he has
                  been conditioned into the state of the demonic. To adapt the logic of his own rhetoric,
                  negated as a human being, he has been recreated as a demon by the relentless scapegoating
                  he has suffered. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9087"><span class="term">destined for some great enterprise </span> 
                  <p>Whether this is seen as an attempt on Victor's part to rewrite his initial account,
                     as an overt expression of a megalomania earlier under firmer control, or as simply
                     a more commanding perspective on his youthful passion, a comparison with the first
                     chapter of his narrative (I:1:18) yields no sense of Victor's feeling singled out
                     for accomplishment, but rather a somewhat wry recollection of a self-indulgent adolescence.
                     Even his remove to Ingolstadt and the most advanced medical school of central Europe
                     is a decision totally "resolved" (I:2:1) by his parents. It is true that Victor has
                     consistently appealed to a ruling destiny (I:1:14, I:2:19, III:4:41) to justify the
                     course of his life. Indeed, it could be argued that his narrative to Walton constitutes
                     a writing of the plot of that destiny, so that by its end every event in his life
                     appears logically necessitated. In that case the force of his autobiography would
                     require that the early chapters be revised to accommodate this narrative necessity.
                     Once again the reader senses in its capacity for revision an underlying instability
                     in the text of the novel. This indeterminacy is finely underscored in the 1831 revision
                     where "I believed myself destined" is substituted for "I felt as if I were destined."
                     </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9096"><span class="term">in proper detail </span> This remark may be seen as less innocent than it appears at first. Victor is about
                  to recount a trial in which it is essential that he exonerate himself. On a more interior
                  level of the discourse we as readers are privy to a second narrative, which is meant
                  by Victor to exonerate the course of his life to Walton and, through Walton, to posterity.
                  This comment, then, links up with other instances, both early and late in the novel,
                  in which Victor's concern with rhetorical propriety shadows a desire to write history
                  so as to reflect well on him (see I:L4:30, I:3:13, and III:WC:2 and III:WC:4). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9103"><span class="term">Devil </span> Having called the creature both "dæmon" and "wretch" in the previous paragraphs,
                  Victor naturally adds "devil" to his name-calling. In these paragraphs we observe
                  both Victor and the Creature revert to the nomenclature of Volume 2 to define their
                  unchanging relationship. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9110"><span class="term">the devouring and only passion of my soul </span> As is often the case, what appears at first to be an indulgence in gothic hyperbole
                  on Mary Shelley's part on second glance bears a startling exactness. The passion of
                  revenge has been truly devouring Victor from within. The more obsessively he devotes
                  himself to it the more assuredly he pursues his own destruction. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9118"><span class="term">The die is cast </span> As several editions of the novel have noted, this phrase was uttered by Julius Caesar
                  when he crossed the Rubicon: it is quoted in the Life of Julius Caesar, the first
                  of the Lives of the Twelve Caesars of Caius Suetonius Tranquillus. Mary Shelley read
                  Suetonius in May 1817 while she was writing Frankenstein, so it is certain that she
                  would not allude to this famous phrase without a sense of its actual context. Caesar
                  goes forward to total victory, whereas it would seem in contrast that Walton returns
                  in defeat. But perhaps the context is as ironic as that provided Victor's speech to
                  the sailors by Dante's Inferno 26. In such a case we might want to read Walton's superficial
                  defeat as cloaking a moral victory. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9125"><span class="term">you should . . . make up your mind to disappointment </span> Just at the point that we may have become overly preoccupied with Victor's own preoccupation
                  with the image he cuts, we are brought back to the reality of why he is forced so
                  carefully to hold up a mirror to his conduct. This stolid Swiss bureaucrat flattens
                  four murders and the destruction of a prominent Genevan family into a matter of "disappointment"
                  for Victor. It is little wonder that, after what he has suffered, he explodes in anger.

                  <p>Alphonse Frankenstein, more than any other member of the family, prizes a total seclusion
                     from the world. This may be contrued as a result of his advanced years, but it does
                     appear in sharp contrast to his long professional commitment to public service in
                     Geneva. His desire for retreat is tied directly to that of the Creature, and Victor's
                     unwillingness to satisfy the desire demanded by the Creature on Mont Blanc will likewise
                     visit dire consequences on his father. </p> </li>

                  <p>Alphonse Frankenstein's foregrounding of domesticity may come as something of a shock
                     after the Creature's long account of his life amid the sublime landscape of Mont Blanc.
                     The aftershock is the realization that he is privileging the same exclusionary tribalism
                     as Felix De Lacey. No more than the De Laceys could one expect the Creature to be

                  <p>The Shelleys passed the Drance during their Swiss excursion; it is described in Letter
                     6 of A History of a Six Weeks' Tour: </p> 
                  <p>As soon as we had passed the opposite promontory, we saw the river Drance, which descends
                     from between a chasm in the mountains, and makes a plain near the lake, intersected
                     by its divided streams. Thousands of besolets, beautiful water-birds, like sea-gulls,
                     but smaller, with purple on their backs, take their station on the shallows, where
                     its waters mingle with the lake. </p> <span class="term"> </span> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9168"><span class="term">dread, and yet be pleased </span> The delicacy with which Elizabeth recognizes Victor's possible ambivalence to an
                  eroticized relationship with her has the paradoxical effect of alerting us to its
                  rougher corollary in events of the novel of which she is ignorant. Translated from
                  the level domestic plane in which she is centered to the sublime heights where Victor
                  and his Creature struggle, this ambivalence might seem strangely akin to the intense
                  love-hate dynamic in which that homosocial relationship plays itself out. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9175"><span class="term">I was dreaming until night should come, and that I should then enjoy reality </span> As normative time-frames lose their distinction at the beginning of this chapter
                  and increasingly death comes to subsume life (see III:7:4), this further jumbling
                  of reality and the world of dream seems particularly appropriate to Victor's slippage
                  into a delusionary psychic state. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9182"><span class="term">the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties </span> That Victor, who has throughout the novel been unable to fulfill his duties to either
                  his family or his Creature, should be able to speak in such measured terms of a balance
                  among multiple duties is certainly an indication of the objectivity and even wisdom
                  to which he may aspire when he moves outside his own narrow concerns. That he specifically
                  steps back from the coercive tone by which he had earlier tried to enlist Walton as
                  his agent in murder (III:7:26) likewise testifies to his rediscovery of a moral center
                  in his last hours of life. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9189"><span class="term">This was my duty </span> This is paradoxically the only occasion in which Victor Frankenstein, without prodding,
                  acknowledges that he had a duty toward the being he created. Earlier, we will recall,
                  the Creature had himself to instruct Victor on this subject (II:2:7 and note). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9196"><span class="term">It is your duty as a magistrate </span> Victor, we should remind ourselves, comes from a long line of magistrates (see, e.g.,
                  I:1:1), and he has quite recently been on trial himself with the magistrate Mr. Kirwan
                  leading his defence; so therefore it is clear that he perfectly well knows what their
                  duties are. To state them so boldly to this judge requires something of his father's
                  authority. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9204"><span class="term">an early marriage would at all interfere . . . utility </span> 
                  <p>We may observe how totally within a masculine prerogative lie the consummation, delay,
                     or even the value of a marriage. Values like "honour and utility" are not to be thought
                     of in relation to women's lives. Before questioning why Mary Shelley would adopt so
                     seemingly unfeminist a posture, we should recognize that this is exactly how Mary
                     Wollstonecraft saw the case: see, for instance, Vindication of the Rights of Woman
                     (12.25). </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9213"><span class="term">this elevation . . . madness </span> Again, Victor's excesses of language betray him. What if it were actually the case
                  that he is insane? Then, the magistrate would only be defusing a tense and socially
                  threatening situation by trying to soothe him into emotional tranquillity. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9220"><span class="term">the power of his eloquence </span> Again, a reader senses how double-edged is the idea of eloquence in this novel. On
                  the one hand, Victor's oratory energizes the crew in positive thinking and rouses
                  them to their tasks. Without this invigoration their situation could degenerate into
                  a laxity of spirit and effort perilous to their well-being. Yet, the emptiness of
                  mere rhetoric is likewise emphasized here, since the courage roused one day gives
                  in to despondency the next. Words relate to reality only tangentially or conditionally,
                  and when the reality remains implacable, Victor's signifying words appear hollow substitutes
                  for its unavoidable presence. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9227"><span class="term">his powers of eloquence and persuasion </span> Walton refers to the last paragraph of Victor's narration (III:7:26 and note), forgetting,
                  it would appear, his friend's later adjustment that he was then "actuated by selfish
                  and vicious motives" (III:Walton:28 and note). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9234"><span class="term">eloquence </span> In the very last paragraph of his narration (III:7:26 and note) Victor warned Walton
                  to beware of mere eloquence, since the Creature's eloquence had once persuaded him
                  to undertake a second monstrous creation to which on sober reflection he should not
                  have agreed. Should we therefore construe Walton's faith in Victor's eloquence in
                  similar terms? Or does it testify to the innate sympathy that eloquence forges between
                  one human being and another? Again, Mary Shelley seems to raise major questions only
                  to leave them wholly ambiguous in their import. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9241"><span class="term">He is eloquent and persuasive </span> Mary Shelley nicely returns us to the earlier concern with the relationship between
                  eloquence and truth, between the representation of action and action itself, well
                  aware of how the issue impinges both on her characters (particularly Victor's desire
                  to vindicate himself to the world) and on her own art.

                  paragraph of his resumed narrative (III:Walton:1 and note), we are here made conscious
                  of how essentially manipulative (even if it could be argued to be not wholly intentional)
                  is Victor's effort to insure that his perspective on events becomes the official record
                  handed down to posterity. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9257"><span class="term">demoniacal enemy </span> In the third volume Victor has increasingly come to refer to the Creature as a "daemon,"
                  thus not only dehumanizing him through an association with Satanic evil, but also,
                  by conferring on the Creature a transcendental status, absolving himself as his Creator
                  from any responsibility for his nature. In effect, linguistically, Victor is canceling
                  his own role in the formation of the Creature. </li>

                  <p>Ernest is at this point about nineteen years old, and, whether or not he has followed
                     his father's wishes and begun to study law, it is clear that he has not pursued his
                     earlier inclination, as expressed in Elizabeth's letter to Victor at Ingolstadt (I:5:2),
                     to eschew the public life and become a farmer. Whatever degree he contemplates, we
                     can determine from this statement that he is undertaking some extended program of
                     higher education at the University of Geneva. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9282"><span class="term">Ernest yet lived </span> This is the last reference to Victor's younger brother in the novel. He is left,
                  a nineteen-year-old student at the University of Geneva, perhaps to learn a more human
                  kind of knowledge than his brother, certainly to carry the family name forward solely
                  by himself. He is the single survivor of the catastrophic history surrounding Victor
                  Frankenstein. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9290"><span class="term">the events </span> That Mary Shelley principally wrote Frankenstein, and certainly its third volume,
                  while living in Marlow, near Windsor and not far from Oxford, might logically have
                  suggested to her the value of inserting its local scenery and history into her novel.
                  More pointedly, her own tribute to her father, in dedicating her novel to Godwin,
                  would have been underscored by her including scenes associated with his most recent
                  novel Mandeville, centered on the English civil war in the mid-seventeenth century.
                  For this politically-minded group of writers (Godwin, Mary Shelley, P. B. Shelley),
                  the civil war had been, first and foremost, a conflict of ideologies pitting aristocratic
                  against republican values. Although a century and a half past, its political resonanace
                  was far from muted in a reactionary political climate like England's during the Regency.
                  Thus, the political undertones of this choice of scenery on Mary Shelley's part are
                  unlikely to have been in any sense innocent. 
                  <p>That said, there is another salient reason for the British setting of the earlier
                     chapters of Volume 3, which is the simple fact that the novel is designed for an English-reading
                     audience rather unaccustomed during the years of the Napoleonic Wars either themselves
                     to travel abroad or to respond with much interest to a continental setting as sweeping
                     as that embraced by the first two volumes. In its final volume Frankenstein goes rather
                     out of its way, as if designed according to formula, to embrace all three parts of
                     the United Kingdom. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9299"><span class="term">everlasting hatred </span> If we can believe that the Creature really used such language, then its very indistinguishability
                  from Victor's, even down to the extreme hyperbole of the adjective, is another indication
                  that at this late point in the novel, the two of them have become a single entity
                  whose overriding passion is hatred and whose life force is provided by death. </li>

                  a natural destination for a honeymoon couple from Geneva. </li>

               <li class="item" id="d30e9334"><span class="term">examining my past conduct </span> The plot of Frankenstein, with its insistent narrative mirrorings and doublings of
                  character, seems always to be engaged in reexamining its own conduct, a process that
                  contributes to the reader's skepticism about the truth of any single utterance by
                  its protagonists. Here, in an epitome of this structural idiosyncrasy, we are told
                  that Victor, after recounting his biography and then rewriting those parts of it he
                  felt Walton had not succeeded in capturing in the manner in which he wanted them represented
                  (III:Walton:4), has rethought the terms of his entire narrative and has revised it
                  once more. That last revision, however, we will never read: the synopsis here presented
                  does, however, differ in salient ways from the account we have been asked to accept
                  as the truth. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9341"><span class="term">excitements to his vengeance </span> Walton is referring to Victor's own acute sense that the spirit world that guides
                  him is vindictive (III:7:19) and exonerates him from normal codes of worldly justice
                  or, indeed, responsibility for his acts as a member of society. Yet, the emphasis
                  here on "his vengeance" suggests that Walton's apprehension is crucially different
                  from Victor's own and serves to underscore the delusional, paranoid mentality that
                  is now Victor's habitual mode of thought. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9348"><span class="term">external nature </span> This sentence suggests that, in this novel, nature as a principle, as is often the
                  case with Enlightement materialist philosophy, is carrying something of the freight
                  associated with the deity in earlier religious formulations. Nature is acknowledged
                  as an enveloping principle of reality, and Clerval's feeling for it marks both his
                  largeness of mind and disinterested perspective. </li>

                  his friends (I:1:11). Clerval responds in part to the many legendary associations
                  of the Rhine—from the siren-like Lorelei to the Rhine-maidens with their trove of
                  gold—in German folklore. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9362"><span class="term">the amiable Falkland </span> Sir Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland, was one of the principal Cavaliers in the
                  service of Charles I. He died at the Battle of Newbury on 20 September 1643. His name
                  and exalted notion of honor were, it would appear, used by William Godwin as models
                  for the hero-villain Count Ferdinando Falkland of The Adventures of Caleb Williams.
                  Today Falkland's fame is sustained by his serving as one of the subjects of Ben Jonson's
                  enduring tribute "To the Immortal Memory and Friendship of That Nobel Pair Sir Lucius
                  Cary and Sir H. Morison," one of the first true odes in the English tradition. 
                  <p>The somewhat surprising emphasis on royalist values in this paragraph is suggestive
                     of a historical politics far removed from that elsewhere insinuated into Frankenstein
                     (see, for instance, II:5:16) or shared by Mary Shelley with her father and Percy.
                     These references are perhaps best explained within the context of the novel William
                     Godwin published about a month before Frankenstein appeared, Mandeville: A Tale of
                     the Seventeenth Century in England. The protagonist of that novel is an ultra-Royalist
                     who, as his cause deteriorates, retreats further and further into morbid self-obsession.
                     The emotional dynamics of Mandeville, if not the portraiture itself, are consonant
                     with the psychological makeup of Victor Frankenstein. </p> </li>

                  <p>The phrasing here makes Victor sound cavalier and shallow, no longer responsive to
                     the weight of the universe he had felt after his encounter on Mont Blanc (II:9:19).
                     His aim seems less to complete a difficult assignment than to procrastinate as long
                     as possible. Whatever one might argue in extenuation of his motives, it seems clear
                     in this passage that he gives no thought whatsoever to the Creature's well-being.
                     Perhaps it was with some sense of mitigating these unflattering character traits that
                     in 1831 Mary Shelley revised this passage to suggest a greater degree of responsibility
                     on Victor's part. </p> </li>

               <li class="item" id="d30e9388"><span class="term">feelings of affection </span> One senses here a last-ditch recapitulation of earlier statements by the Creature,

                  is associated in the novel both with a transgressive voyaging (see I:L2:6 and note)

                  that a long period of convalescence was necessary to restore him to a state in which
                  he could withstand his trial in Ireland (see III:4:11 and III:4:42). </li>

                  a disease would be correlative to, and even emblematic of, Victor's mental condition.

                  reminds the literate reader of the "fearful joy" that the youths momentarily "snatch"
                  on their school playing field in Thomas Gray's "Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton
                  College" (line 40) and recalls the anxiety-ridden states of fever that have furnished
                  a recurrent counterpoint to Victor's experiences with the Creature (see I:3:14, I:4:17).

                  <p>As is evidenced by his once again denominating his Creature by degrading epithets,
                     Victor returns to his old habits of mind as the time slips away.</p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9439"><span class="term">a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity </span> Here, and throughout the ensuing paragraphs, Victor indulges in a determined, almost
                  compulsive hyperbole that distances himself from and demonizes his creation. In the
                  process Victor comes to identify himself with "the whole human race" against the anomalous
                  alien being he would cast out from it. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9446"><span class="term">Filled with dreary imaginations </span> 
                  <p>The withdrawal is a dangerous portent, but for Mary Shelley once again to connect
                     such a process with the exercise of the imagination clearly questions the value of
                     this central concept of Romanticism. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9455"><span class="term">a filthy process </span> Victor echoes the term he used to characterize his laboratory in Ingolstadt: "my
                  workshop of filthy creation" (I:3:9). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9463"><span class="term">The fishermen called to one another </span> In this extreme silence the intrusion of human sounds not only testifies to the ongoing
                  processes of everyday life, but reminds us that even in the farthest reaches of the
                  globe human beings establish a basic community one with the other. These sounds from
                  the darkness at once remind us of the Creature's yearning to participate in such a
                  community and reinforce Victor's total self-exclusion from its claims. Moreover, surely
                  there is an intentional irony here pitting the productive labor of the fishermen,
                  who in turn depend upon it for their sustenance, against the long-postponed and now
                  aborted labor of Victor, who is financially free of such necessities, as well as the
                  lack of productive community in which the Creature is forced to exist. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9470"><span class="term">a fit of enthusiastic madness </span> Although one of the definitions in Johnson's Dictionary describes the substantive
                  of this word as "any violent affection of mind or body," in general the connotation
                  emphasized is the temporary state of the affliction. In contrast, Victor's enthusiastic
                  obsession was years in its gestation, and it was succeeded by another, more lethal
                  obsession with the destruction of the being he created. In other words, though the
                  madness he admits to may have taken several forms, it has been unremitting since he
                  entered upon his studies at the University of Ingolstadt. As Victor's diction appears
                  to mitigate its force, it suggests that even now, in his final assessment, he is unwilling
                  fully to engage his own culpability. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9477"><span class="term">flying to solitude </span> Elizabeth's seemingly innocent expression is remarkable for the extremity of its
                  depiction. It suggests that a detached perspective on Victor's withdrawal would make
                  it seem more neurotic than it might appear to us as accustomed sharers of Victor's
                  point of view. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9484"><span class="term">the image of my former self </span> Although there is some small hint of this function for Clerval in various parts of
                  the first volume, only here, after the establishment of a complex doubling between
                  Victor and the Creature, does Mary Shelley extend the pattern to involve Clerval.
                  Given Mary Shelley's setting Clerval within the context of Wordsworth's "Tintern Abbey"
                  in the previous chapter (III:1:21), it is hard not to hear in this phrase the timbres
                  Wordsworth addresses to his sister in that poem (lines 116-19). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9491"><span class="term">your own free choice </span> The inclusion of this resonant diction seems intended to establish a linkage between
                  the personal and more public conceptions of responsibility that can be traced through
                  the novel. Although Victor, and recently his father too, think of him as haunted by
                  a destiny over which he has no control (III:4:43), Elizabeth's language is firmly
                  rooted in the primacy of choice in all human relations. Her rejection of a male concept
                  of honor here seems to link it to stereotypes of behavior that at once shackle the
                  will and suspend the individual's ultimate responsibility for actions and their consequences.
                  </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9498"><span class="term">enthusiastic frenzy </span> Earlier in his recital Victor remembered his compulsive application in Ingolstadt
                  as "ardour" and thought his "enthusiasm" then to be essentially innocent (I:3:8).
                  The symptoms noted there all return here, although their neurotic character is now
                  much more firmly marked. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9505"><span class="term">I have longed for a friend </span> Walton looks back to the desire expressed in his second letter to his sister (I:L2:2)
                  and reiterated to Victor Frankenstein (I:L4:25), who replied in despondency over the
                  memory of his dead friend Henry Clerval (I:L4:26). In reinstating that wish, Walton
                  reminds us of how very little time has actually elapsed in the narrative frame of
                  the novel as well as of how violent and destructive such intense relationships can
                  become when they are based on hatred rather than affection. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9512"><span class="term">friendship </span> As with other aspects of Clerval, his capacity for "devoted," which is to say, perfectly
                  disinterested, friendship separates him as an ideal, both for Victor (who from his
                  student days has been too self-absorbed for such friendship) and for Walton, whose
                  desire for such a friend, articulated in his second letter (I:L2:1) and in his growing
                  attachment(I:L4:21) to Victor, first introduced this theme as central to the structure
                  of Mary Shelley's novel. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9519"><span class="term">to fulfill my wishes and my destiny </span> Victor, apparently deluded into believing his desires and his destiny the same, does
                  not notice the double connotation to which his phrase is susceptible. His wishes are,
                  indeed, for a happy, prosperous marriage; but the destiny he has marked out for himself
                  is exactly opposite, to suffer ruin. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9526"><span class="term">fury </span> As with the other terms of this loaded paragraph, this word, when contemplated from
                  the reader's perspective of Victor's biography, bears connotations by which it is
                  unlikely he would have wanted himself represented. In essence, as he gives himself
                  over to the raw fury of his rage, Victor seems to be acceding to the madness that
                  has become progressively more accentuated in his account. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9533"><span class="term">generous and self-devoted being </span> In a novel in which oxymorons have increasingly come to represent implacable ambivalences,
                  this summary of Victor Frankenstein stands out as an epitome. If readers should wonder
                  whether it is really possible so to overlay what appear to be opposite constructions,
                  a scrupulous respect for earlier connotations of the terms will sharpen the meaning
                  if not wholly dispel its ambiguities. Dr. Johnson's Dictionary (1755) lists these
                  meanings for "generous": 
                  <ul>
                     <li class="item" id="d30e9539">Not of mean birth; of good extraction. </li>
                     <li class="item" id="d30e9540">Noble of mind; magnanimous; open of heart. </li>
                     <li class="item" id="d30e9541">Liberal; munificent. </li>
                     <li class="item" id="d30e9542">Strong; vigorous. </li>
                  </ul> It is clear that the third, which is the customary modern sense of the word, would
                  be generally inappropriate to the figure that Victor Frankenstein has cut in this
                  novel, but either of the other three meanings would in one phase or another of his
                  existence adequately characterize him. The main thrust of the Creature's meaning is
                  probably the second. Even here, however, some readers might wish to cavil, asking
                  whether, given Frankenstein's ambitions and good intentions but customary self-enclosure,
                  it would be possible to retain a nobility of mind without being greatly magnanimous
                  or open-hearted. 
                  <p>With "self-devoted," the range of possibility is even greater and likewise is further
                     from a modern, loose conception of the term as meaning "devoted to one's self." The
                     three definitions of "to devote" in Johnson's Dictionary are: </p> 
                  <ul>
                     <li class="item" id="d30e9547">to dedicate; to consecrate; to appropriate </li>
                     <li class="item" id="d30e9548">to addict; to give up to ill </li>
                     <li class="item" id="d30e9549">to curse; to execrate; to doom to destruction </li>
                  </ul> All of these definitions have a bearing on Victor Frankenstein's character, even
                  simultaneously so, but in the context of the Creature's expression of "wildest rage,"
                  an attribute mirrored between him and his creator, the last of the definitions would
                  seem to bear a particular relevance. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9554"><span class="term">I, the native of a genial and sunny climate </span> The atmosphere of the third volume of the novel, with the exception of the honeymoon
                  excursion along Lake Geneva, has been so far from genial that the reader is enjoined
                  at this point to recall the original balancing of the novel, in which the civilized
                  bourgeois world of the Frankenstein household represents the beautiful against the
                  sublime of Mont Blanc and the Creature whom Victor encounters there in the second
                  volume (II:2:5). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9561"><span class="term">A ghastly grin </span> This is only the second occasion in which the Creature is perceived smiling (the
                  first is in I:4:3), and in each case Victor interprets an expression of pleasure and
                  anticipation as alien, even diabolical. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9568"><span class="term">a gigantic monster </span> As this paragraph suggests ("the fiend" . . . "the fiend" . . . "a gigantic monster"),
                  the creation of an abnormal identity through naming has become wholly habitual on
                  Victor's part. We have here, however, one last indication that, wherever the Creature
                  goes, he is immediately accorded the status of monster by the human beings he encounters.
                  </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9575"><span class="term">in giving the life and spirit </span> There is no little irony in this phrase, since Victor has already in a material sense,
                  given "life and spirit" to his Creature and even to his Creature as "enemy." Given
                  his manifest failure on the level of the actual, his desire to succeed on the level
                  of the merely textual may be understandable, but it is no less morally problematic.
                  Having the last word must be a poor substitute for acting with foresight and responsibility
                  in the first place. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9582"><span class="term">the glimmer of two eyes </span> This is an unmistakeable reference to "Alastor," the poem Percy Bysshe Shelley published
                  in March 1816 a few months before the excursion to Lake Geneva. The protagonist of
                  that poem is haunted by the two eyes of a "veilèd maid" (line 151) of whom he dreamed
                  and whom he subsequently pursues to the end of his life. As he dies his last glimpse
                  is of "two lessening points of light [that] / Gleamed through the darkness" (lines
                  654-55), an all-consuming ideal that is the ironic cause of his destruction. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9589"><span class="term">glorious creature </span> 
                  <p>The shading here seems deliberately suggestive of Milton's Satan. From the very first,
                     the Satanic legions sense that the fall from heaven has diminished their spiritual
                     essence, and, as in these early words of Satan's chief follower Beelzebub, that loss
                     is expressed in terms of "glory." <br/>the mind and spirit remains <br/> Invincible, and vigour soon returns, <br/> Though all our glory extinct, and happy state <br/> Here swallowed up in endless misery. (I.139-42) The most resonant identification
                     of diminished glory with the fall of the angels is uttered by Satan as he soliloquizes
                     atop Mount Niphates at the opening of Book IV. There, as he addresses the Sun, the
                     fallen archangel directly contrasts himself and God in terms of their manifestation
                     of glory. <br/> O thou, that, with surpassing glory crowned, <br/> Lookest from thy sole dominion like the God <br/> Of this new world; at whose sight all the stars <br/> Hide their diminished heads; to thee I call, <br/> But with no friendly voice, and add thy name, <br/> O Sun! to tell thee how I hate thy beams, <br/> That bring to my remembrance from what state <br/> I fell, how glorious once above thy sphere; <br/> Till pride and worse ambition threw me down <br/> Warring in Heaven against Heaven's matchless King.

                  I:7:27, and note. The Creature had earlier gnashed his teeth when shot by the father
                  of the girl he rescued (see II:8:20 and note): then, as here, he vowed revenge. </li>

                  <p>Mary Shelley refers to the account of the long Greek retreat from Armenia in Xenophon's
                     Anabasis, 4.7, quoted here in the translation of Carleton L. Brownson (Cambridge:
                     Harvard University Press, 1918): </p> 
                  <p>{329}<br/> [18] Leaving this land [of the Chalybians], the Greeks arrived at the Harpasus river,
                     which was four plethra in width. From there they marched through the territory of
                     the Scythinians four stages, twenty parasangs, over a level plain, and they arrived
                     at some villages, and there remained for three days and collected provisions.</p> 
                  <p>[19] From there they journeyed four stages, twenty parasangs, to a large and prosperous
                     inhabited city which was called Gymnias. From this city the ruler of the land sent
                     the Greeks a guide, in order to lead them through territory that was hostile to his
                     own. </p> 
                  <p>[20] When the guide came, he said that he would lead them within five days to a place
                     from which they could see the sea; if he failed to do so, he was ready to accept death.
                     Thus taking the lead, as soon as he had brought them into the hostile territory, he
                     kept urging them to spread abroad fire and ruin, thereby making it clear that it {331}
                     was with this end in view that he had come, and not out of good-will toward the Greeks.
                     </p> 
                  <p>[21] On the fifth day they did in fact reach the mountain; its name was Theches. Now
                     as soon as the vanguard got to the top of the mountain, a great shout went up. </p> 
                  <p>[22] And when Xenophon and the rearguard heard it, they imagined that other enemies
                     were attacking in front; for enemies were following behind them from the district
                     that was in flames, and the rearguard had killed some of them and captured others
                     by setting an ambush, and had also taken about twenty wicker shields covered with
                     raw, shaggy ox-hides. </p> 
                  <p>[23] But as the shout kept getting louder and nearer, as the successive ranks that
                     came up all began to run at full speed toward the ranks ahead that were one after
                     another joining in the shout, and as the shout kept growing far louder as the number
                     of men grew steadily greater, it became quite clear to Xenophon that here was something
                     of unusual importance; </p> 
                  <p>[24] so he mounted a horse, took with him Lycius and the cavalry, and pushed ahead
                     to lend aid; and in a moment they heard the soldiers shouting, "The Sea! The Sea!"
                     and passing the word along. Then all the troops of the rearguard likewise broke into
                     a run, and the pack animals began racing ahead and the horses. </p> 
                  <p>[25] And when all had reached the summit, then indeed they fell to embracing one another,
                     and generals and captains as well, with tears in their eyes. And on a sudden, at the
                     bidding of some one or other, the soldiers began to bring stones and to build a great
                     cairn. </p> 
                  <p>[26] Thereon they placed as offerings a quantity of raw ox-hides and walking-sticks
                     and the captured wicker shields; and the guide not only cut these {333} shields to
                     pieces himself, but urged the others to do so. </p> 
                  <p>[27] After this the Greeks dismissed the guide with gifts from the common stock --
                     a horse, a silver cup, a Persian dress, and ten darics; but what he particularly asked
                     the men for was their rings, and he got a considerable number of them. Then he showed
                     them a village to encamp in and the road they were to follow to the country of the

                  extinguished so that the room is only illuminated by the moon, it would appear next
                  to impossible for Victor so sharply to distinguish a visage that would be backlit
                  in such circumstances. Neither the Creature's own narration in the second volume nor
                  his account of his struggles with Victor Frankenstein at the end accords with such
                  a perspective of fiendish exultation in evil. This portrait is, however, wholly commensurate
                  with Victor's increasing tendency to demonize the Creature. See I:6:22, II:2:6, and
                  III:3:2. </li>

                  antihuman solidity of this barren field of ice, even where mountains appear to arise
                  from it, there is open and fluid water capable of erupting with terrifying sublimity.
                  Victor is, in fact, at sea; he has become the ancient mariner that the continual evocation
                  of Coleridge's text across the length of the novel has presaged.

               <li class="item" id="d30e9724"><span class="term">A ground sea </span> The fluid undercurrent belying the solidity of this iceworld (see also III:7:20 and
                  note) erupts with extraordinary effect, almost as an objective correlative for the
                  "burning gush of hope" and "heart pound[ing]" remarked within Victor in the previous
                  paragraphs. This ground-sea appears as almost a metaphor for the essentially human
                  that even in the most extreme of circumstances cannot be repressed. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9731"><span class="term">some great crime </span> The reader might well wish to contemplate the oddly contradictory character of this
                  formulation. Although Victor can exonerate himself by means of analytical logic, the
                  process is not liberating. Instead, psychologically he finds himself in a limbo of
                  uncertainty and incapacity, haunted by a dread he can neither escape nor define. Given
                  the increasingly psychotic symptoms he will reveal in the later chapters of the novel,
                  this early formulation may be considered a touchstone for Victor's successive mental
                  breakdowns. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9738"><span class="term">the great road </span> The road between London and Edinburgh had in the eighteenth century been improved
                  to the equivalent of a modern superhighway, allowing a speedy transit to both mail
                  and passengers and the commercial consolidation of the "United Kingdom." </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9745"><span class="term">my guiding spirit </span> The assurance of a guiding spirit on Victor's part is now total, but the previous
                  references in this chapter, in their shaded ambiguity, along with the context of P.
                  B. Shelley's "Alastor, or the Spirit of Solitude" (published February 1816), compel
                  the reader to question whether that guardian is a good angel or an evil spirit, an
                  alastor. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9752"><span class="term">I had money with me </span> This is not, perhaps, so innocuous a statement as it at first appears. Why should
                  such a statement matter to this narrative, except by way of reminding us that the
                  Creature, besides being a vegetarian, exists wholly outside the economy that links
                  Victor with other human beings? This is a telling reminder of the isolation of his
                  uniqueness, of how on a literal level all of humankind implicitly conspire to exclude
                  him from their interchange. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9759"><span class="term">that half kind of belief </span> With so many allusions to Coleridge's writings governing the exposition of this novel,
                  including the very notion of such a reiterated self-justification as Victor is presenting
                  (see III:6:21 and note), it would not be surprising to see this remark as a recasting
                  of his fine distinction between truth and the "willing suspension of disbelief" in
                  literature (see Biographia Literaria, Chapter 14). But, in fact, there is no assurance
                  that Mary Shelley would have come upon the formulation in time to have inserted it
                  into the novel. P. B. Shelley is recorded as having finished Coleridge's Biographia
                  Literaria on 8 December 1817. Frankenstein was advertised as published on 1 January
                  1818. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9766"><span class="term">a soul more in harmony with man </span> This is very much in the spirit with which Byron represents the Rhine in Childe Harold's
                  Pilgrimage, Canto 3, stanza 45ff.: see particularly his summary in stanzas 59-61.
                  Clerval prefers the beautiful, with its humanistic overtones, to the sublime with
                  its otherworldly and supernatural associations. It is indicative that he centers his
                  descriptions of the landscape upon human images—the priest and his mistress, grape-pickers
                  among the vines—who give historical or local significance to its details. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9773"><span class="term">Havre </span> Le Havre is a principal seaport of Normandy: Mary, Shelley, and Claire Clairmont
                  embarked for England from Le Havre when they returned from Geneva in September 1816
                  . The town would have held more than a tourist's interest for Mary. Her mother Mary
                  Wollstonecraft had moved to Le Havre to escape the Terror of 1794: there she wrote
                  her Historical and Moral View of the Origin and Progress of the French Revolution
                  and gave birth to her daughter Fanny Imlay, Mary's half-sister, in May of that year.
                  
                  <p>In the 1831 revision Mary Shelley has Victor and his father sail directly from Dublin
                     to Le Havre, avoiding the lengthy coach journey across England in the 1818 novel.
                     This, perhaps, reflects a more sophisticated sense of the historical geography of
                     the British Isles gained after her return to England in 1823. Over many centuries
                     Ireland had maintained a commercial and cultural exchange with France that flourished
                     independently from the frames of reference in which the British viewed the power that
                     was increasingly its major antagonist. Napoleon's attempt to capitalize on the Wolfe
                     Tone rebellion of 1798 underscored the dangers implicit in Ireland's independent foreign
                     relations, leading directly to the Act of Union of 1801 in which Ireland was assimilated
                     to the British crown. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9782"><span class="term">my heart . . . escape </span> By this time in his experience Victor might have learned to distrust such a state
                  of self-induced euphoria. It is literally the case that every time he indulges himself
                  in such a light-headed sense that he has escaped his "destiny," he is suddenly caught
                  up short by a new misfortune. (See I:5:17 and II:2:1). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9789"><span class="term">my heart bounded within me </span> Here the conventional associations of erotic passion intrude upon the diction, as
                  the closing of Creator and Creature appears to near its consummation. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9796"><span class="term">the cursed and hellish monster </span> The rhetorical overload here may be considered an appropriate expression of what
                  has become as well for Victor a totalized psychological overload. The "rage" that
                  immediately chokes off his speech is its manifestation. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9804"><span class="term">what remains of my hideous narration </span> The sharp suspension of narrative line here coincides with a self-regarding emphasis
                  on story-telling of a sort that we have witnessed earlier (I:L4:30, I:3:13). Such
                  a mirroring of the function of narrative will become a dominant motif in the late
                  pages of the novel. This act of doubling seems to entail another, identifying the
                  creation that is Victor's tale with his earlier creation, the being who five paragraphs
                  earlier had presented to his sight "a figure the most hideous and deformed" (III:6:10).
                  </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9811"><span class="term">A high destiny </span> This final sentence of Victor's retrospective memoir ends in a tone of great pathos
                  stemming from the most innocuous of verbs: "seemed." Reversing the assurance with
                  which the paragraph began, here Victor comes close to acknowledging that all his talk
                  of and even reliance on a sense of special destiny is empty of signification. If there
                  is no actual destiny, then there is also no particular meaning to what he has done
                  that can exonerate his actions or the path of destruction left in their wake. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9818"><span class="term">line of high land </span> The north coast of Ireland near Scotland is among the most formidable in the British
                  Isles, with high cliffs and a treacherous series of great rocks called the Giant's
                  Causeway upthrust from the sea. At this time, as Mary Shelley's exposition indicates,
                  the basic livelihood for the inhabitants was earned from these dangerous waters. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9825"><span class="term">a hired nurse </span> Up to this point in the novel nursing has been the domain of friends and family,
                  and the willingness to engage in it has been the mark of selfless affection and respect.
                  We recall that Victor's mother Caroline dies from the effects of nursing Elizabeth
                  Lavenza through an adolescent attack of scarlet fever (I:2:2) and that Justine Moritz,
                  in her turn, contracts the disease from attending on Caroline Frankenstein and herself
                  falls "very ill" (I:5:5) as a result. Although not vulnerable to consequences so life-threatening,
                  Henry Clerval acts as Victor's "only nurse" during the months-long nervous fever that
                  incapacitates him after the Creature is brought to life (I:4:17). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9832"><span class="term">Holyhead</span> 
                  <p>Holyhead, on the island of Angelsey, which lies off the northwest coast of Wales,
                     in the eighteenth century had developed into the major port linking Ireland and the
                     British Isles. It was the closest landing place to Dublin, with some 100 kilometers
                     of the Irish Sea intervening. Since, however, Anglesey was an island, passengers still
                     had to negotiate the treacherous Menai Strait linking it to the mainland. In 1810
                     Thomas Telford was commissioned at this site to build the first suspension bridge
                     in the world as part of a modernization of the coach road to Holyhead.</p> 
                  <p>Mary Shelley never traced this itinerary, but Percy did, both going to and returning
                     from his Dublin adventure via Holyhead in 1812. Mary Wollstonecraft had also taken
                     this route when she took up her post as governess in the Irish seat of Lord and Lady
                     Kingsborough in 1786. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9843"><span class="term">honour </span> Honour is a concept that, until now, has figured only modestly in this novel. One
                  earlier reference, however, might be construed to have a bearing on Walton's present
                  insistence on its claims. This comes in Elizabeth's letter of commiseration to Victor
                  about his illness while in Ingolstadt. There she testified to her accord with Ernest's
                  desire to be a farmer, though it were a less "honourable occupation" (I:5:2) than
                  that of a judge. In her letter the idea of honour is tied to social and class hierarchies,
                  perhaps as well to distinctions between gender roles. It is clear that in Walton's
                  eyes his crew are, to return to Victor's formulation (III:Walton:17), lesser men than
                  they would be if they were possessed of a sense of honorable duty to the cause to
                  which their master has committed them. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9850"><span class="term">horrible pilgrimage </span> Another ironic usage of religious terminology, this phrase also reminds us of the
                  principal context for this term in contemporary culture, Byron's monumental antiromance,
                  Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, the third canto of which he wrote during the Geneva summer
                  of 1816. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9857"><span class="term">The hour . . . arrived </span> Ironically affirming the Creature's statement of the reversal of power in their relationship,
                  Victor Frankenstein here as much as signs a contract for their future antagonism.
                  </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9864"><span class="term">I will hover near </span> Victor is transforming himself into the alastor, the evil spirit, that has been his
                  own guardian spirit through this chapter. But what he foresees is grisly, himself
                  as one of the living dead, a zombie haunting the ongoing processes of life among the
                  living. Remarkable as it may seem, this final vision is, in effect, an image of one
                  last Creature let go from his hands as a free and frighteningly independent agent
                  on earth: himself. Perhaps, however, that was what he became from the point at which
                  he matriculated at Ingolstadt and entered into the world of his obsessions. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9871"><span class="term">how happy and serene all nature </span> It appears in this novel that whenever the serenity of nature is emphasized (I:5:17,
                  III:3:6), the sublime power represented by the Creature is introduced to disturb its
                  tranquillity. Before, however, it was Victor who felt the effect of this natural profusion.
                  Here, clearly, Elizabeth is identified with a natural beneficence that Victor over
                  the course of the past five years has all but forsaken. What distinguishes her examples
                  is the ability she demonstrates to see all elements in motion; in their varied relations
                  with one another; and in their distinct particularity, whether distant and high (Mônt
                  Blanc) or near and deep (the bottom of Lake Geneva), rather than according to some
                  reductive model by which they are made identical and rendered inanimate. One senses
                  here a very different conception of nature from that manifested by Victor as scientist.
                  </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9878"><span class="term">a howl of devilish despair and revenge </span> A further instance of Victor's reconstruction of the Creature's emotions as diabolical
                  so as not to have to confront their actual nature. The howl represents, indeed, a
                  reaction of despair following an entire year's attentuated expectation, a year spent
                  in solitude and without any other hope. In turn, that understanding tends to ironize
                  Victor's own emotional dependency on Clerval during their trip. Both creator and creature
                  are here at last equally alone in their solitude, unconsciously prepared to transfer
                  their entire gamut of emotional needs into a single-minded pursuit of the other's
                  destruction. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9886"><span class="term">how little do you know me </span> The return of Alphonse Frankenstein to the narrative center of the novel brings with
                  it the vexed tension between father and son observed in the early chapters when Victor
                  was an adolescent. Victor's silence here, of course, is of no advantage in bringing
                  Alphonse to a better understanding of his by-now adult scion. Perhaps the son's reticence
                  is meant not just to mark his fear that the truth of his guilt would not be countenanced
                  by his father but also to implicate this strained history between them. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9893"><span class="term">how many days have passed </span> Victor has gone from a collapse of time distinctions (as in III:7:4) to an inability
                  to differentiate time itself. The entrance onto the ice field seems to remove him
                  from all normative structures of human life. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9900"><span class="term">human sympathies </span> This sentence carries an interestingly pointed balance. Everywhere in the novel,
                  in accord with Enlightenment values, human sympathy is marked as the foundation for
                  personal and social happiness. Here one infers that Mary Shelley recognizes that even
                  this virtue can lead to a measure of self-absorption in the merely human, at the expense
                  of an external reality principle embodied in nature. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9907"><span class="term">a husband, and lovely children </span> Until this very late point in the novel we have only been able to assume that Margaret
                  Saville, because of the difference in her surname, has a husband. With this confirmed,
                  we discover as well that she has children. One reason Mary Shelley may be supplying
                  this information now would be to justify the emotional intensity of this outpouring
                  in which Walton in solitude and dire straits reaches out to his only family connections.
                  But by the same token, that connectedness contrasts pointedly with the situation in
                  the Frankenstein household, where when the novel ends only Ernest, who would seem
                  to have little to recommend him beyond being a dull and regular fellow, will survive
                  its events. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9914"><span class="term">I called on him to stay </span> In their monosyllabic simplicity these words constitute the moral center of Mary
                  Shelley's novel. Against all his prejudices as Victor's friend, against his repugnance
                  to face a multiple murderer, against his basic human instincts that revolt from such
                  sublime ugliness, Robert Walton wills himself into a state of ethical selflessness
                  that is truly benevolent. The Creature's "wonder" at this unique experience in his
                  existence is only to be expected. He has never before been confronted by human inclusiveness.

               <li class="item" id="d30e9921"><span class="term">I could send . . . illness </span> The normative expression of sympathy by which Mr. Kirwin reestablishes connections
                  that Victor has all but severed emphasizes the extremity of Victor's withdrawal from
                  the society of those who have loved him. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9928"><span class="term">I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness </span> 
                  <p>"By the utmost self-violence": Victor lacks the modern vocabulary that would term
                     this act mere repression. He likens it to suicide, an active, even extreme, assertion
                     of violence against the self. Yet again, the reader may wish to ask, which self is
                     it that he would destroy, that of the Creator or of his extension who has destroyed
                     those whom Victor loves? The doubling of selves is insistent even where, as here,
                     it is merely insinuated.</p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9937"><span class="term">ignorant </span> This is a word with considerable resonance by this point in the novel. Victor has
                  carefully kept Walton ignorant of the process by which he created life, and, moreover,
                  excoriates him when he suspects Walton of wanting to penetrate his secret (III:Walton:3).
                  He dies clearly wishing that he had himself remained in a state of innocent ignorance.
                  Although it is likely that, upon reflection, Walton will broaden the range under which
                  he construes knowledge to embrace a moral education, here he limits its conception
                  wholly to scientific discovery. In his dejection he seems to have gone out of his
                  way to miss the point of Victor Frankenstein's narration, which is itself truly a
                  mark of his ignorance. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9944"><span class="term">I had been conversing with several persons in the island </span> The episode remembered by Victor is not noted in the previous chapter. There, the
                  events of the night before Victor departed "[b]etween two and three in the morning"
                  (III:3:24) are wholly unremarked. Clerval's body was discovered approximately four
                  hours earlier, some time after 10 o'clock. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9951"><span class="term">imagination was dreadful </span> 
                  <p>This is a further example of the dark tones in which the Romantic imagination is painted
                     in this novel, resembling earlier cases where an isolated mind is confronted with
                     a radical uncertainty. For earlier instances pertaining to Victor, see I:4:18 and
                     note; II:1:8 and note; for a similar construction on the part of the Creature, see
                     II:4:17 and note. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9960"><span class="term">the strangest tale that ever imagination formed </span> There may be an element of self-puffery by Mary Shelley in this statement, yet it
                  is surprisingly prescient in its sense of the cultural impact her novel was to have.
                  Moreover, it is entirely consistent with the way both she and her husband represented
                  the work to its public. Percy Bysshe Shelley, writing the Preface to the original
                  edition of Frankenstein, distanced this novel from any attempt at "merely weaving
                  a series of supernatural terrors," insisting on its adherence to the higher aims of
                  the "imagination." Similarly, Mary Shelley, in writing the Introduction to the third
                  edition, stresses how in its initial conception her "imagination, unbidden, possessed
                  and guided" her. That all these statements are congruent with one another and with
                  an exalted notion of the Romantic imagination, however, cannot alter the ironic context
                  in which this particular phrase is uttered. In the previous paragraph we have been
                  observing Victor Frankenstein, who was once swept along by his imagination to create
                  a deformed and alienated being, revising with soberly rational care his account of
                  that act and its consequences. The actual context for this phrase in the novel would
                  thus appear to offset its perhaps expected paean to the imagination. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9968"><span class="term">my imagination was vivid </span> Victor's remembrance alters the emphasis of his earlier account, which contrasted
                  his own interest in facticity with Elizabeth's (and Henry Clerval's) delight in the
                  imagination (I:1:9). However much he may be inflating the record here, the reader
                  cannot but be aware of the ambivalence about the nature of the imagination expressed
                  in these lines. That Victor once "trod heaven in [his] thoughts" cannot mitigate the
                  hellish misery to which he has now sunk, nor even at that earlier point in his remembrance
                  could it guarantee that the outcome of such an introverted elation would have an essential
                  value. The imagination, in this analysis, might be necessary for great achievement,
                  but by itself it is by no means sufficient, being merely an instrument, and, as such,
                  easily capable of indulging a self-absorbed solipsism. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9975"><span class="term">immersed in a solitude </span> This statement makes very clear that, for Victor, solitude carries psychological
                  consequences of considerable and dangerous weight. From this point on for many months,
                  with only the briefest exceptions, Victor will be trapped in a kind of solitary confinement.
                  What begins as a figurative condition, indeed, will become an actual physical fact.
                  </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9982"><span class="term">my first impulses </span> The repression of instinctive response continues as Walton, deeply mindful of the
                  solemn and reiterated injunction of Victor Frankenstein to exact vengeance upon his
                  Creature, hesitates before the presence of the other being. In essence, he substitutes
                  a reality for an abstraction, his own actuality for the vicarious experience provided
                  by Victor's narrative. Implied in this act is the priority of individual responsibility
                  for independent judgment. That Walton is preoccupied by his "impulses" in the plural
                  may indicate how difficult, complex, and responsive to particular circumstances such
                  a judgment must be. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9989"><span class="term">a part of the inheritance of Elizabeth </span> This addition to the 1831 text recalls the changed circumstances by which Elizabeth
                  enters into the Frankenstein household, as the natural daughter of a revolutionary
                  Milanese aristocrat who had been imprisoned by the Austrian government and had had
                  his property confiscated (see I:1:9) for being too ardent in the cause of his country's
                  liberty. Although Alphonse Frankenstein's dealings here might be construed as an honorable,
                  duty-bound attempt by a citizen of a neutral nation to right a wrong and restore to
                  Elizabeth what had been rightly hers, it is hard to imagine Mary Shelley, who abhorred
                  the Austrian occupation of Italy and represented Elizabeth's true father as "nursed
                  in the antique glory of Italy," not thinking this detail commensurate with the essentially
                  conservative, state-oriented political views Alphonse exhibits elsewhere (see, for
                  instance, I:1:1 or I:6:44 and note). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e9996"><span class="term">injustice </span> In his petulance Walton equates justice to his crew with injustice to himself. That
                  larger, disinterested justice is, however, the stronger ethical position, as Walton
                  himself understood when his crew presented its case to him earlier (III:Walton:16).
                  </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10003"><span class="term">inquiries concerning an event </span> 
                  <p>The diction Victor uses suggests that it is less having to inform mutual friends of
                     Clerval's death than his sense of culpability for it, with the attendant need to exonerate
                     himself, that drives him to avoid his English acquaintance, and perhaps some in France
                     as well. However we construe his hesitancy, Victor's total rerouting of his itinerary
                     here is of a piece with his progressive withdrawal from human society and normative
                     social obligations. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10012"><span class="term">instantly darted into my mind </span> Every detail of this scene seems meant to impress on those observing it that Victor's
                  purchase on reality is tentative at best. The closed circle of logic in which his
                  mind revolves leads him to conclusions that, on the face of it, would seem ludicrous:
                  in this case, the supposition that Mr. Kirwin would be opening the door to Victor's
                  Creature. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10019"><span class="term">interest for my guest </span> Where the first paragraph may lead Mary Shelley's readers to question the uses (and
                  abuses) of writing, the second quickly reminds us of its effects in reinforcing human
                  sympathy and community. Walton's concern for Victor is, of course, a measure of his
                  responsiveness as well and therefore of consequence for our estimation of his character.
                  </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10026"><span class="term">the Irish </span> Improbably, Victor has floated some hundreds of miles. Moreover, as we discover in
                  the next chapter he is not the only one who has traversed the open seas southwest
                  of the Orkneys to land on the northeast coast of Ireland. Although it has been suggested
                  that including Ireland in the expansive geographical range of the novel may be Mary
                  Shelley's means of honoring her mother, who served as a governess there, the strangeness
                  of this repositioning of setting has never been adequately accounted for. 
                  <p>From Victor's reference to "a line of high land" (III:3:26), we may suppose that Mary
                     Shelley has in mind geological features like the Giant's Causeway, a line of huge
                     islets, or the cliffs of Fair Head. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10035"><span class="term">company was irksome to me </span> Victor's rationalizations for his withdrawal from social interaction have an obvious
                  logic to support them. Still, that this characteristic retreat within reasserts itself
                  even where he should feel most diverted by his novel surroundings indicates a dangerous
                  state of mental health. </li>

               <li class="item" id="d30e10050"><span class="term">it was he . . . nurse </span> Mary Shelley's emphasis is delicate but marked. In his several months of illness
                  and misery it appears that only late does Victor recognize that there are medical
                  costs that had to be borne by someone. He has focussed critically on the quality of
                  the care without inquiring who had accepted the expence on his behalf. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10057"><span class="term">I will not </span> The reader may have forgotten, but certainly Victor Frankenstein has not, that he
                  deserted the ice floe on which Walton's crew had discovered him and boarded the sailing
                  vessel only because its course lay to the north, the destination toward which his
                  pursuit of the Creature was leading him (I:L4:8). Now that Walton's ship veers to
                  the south, remaining aboard can no longer serve his purpose, which is as single-minded
                  in its vengeance as ever. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10064"><span class="term">the journal of Clerval </span> Lacking the journal of Clerval, we will have to settle for that of Mary Shelley,
                  who traversed this route in 1814 and published it in her History of a Six Weeks' Tour
                  just before Frankenstein. At that time the point of departure for the Shelley party
                  was Basel. 
                  <p>Yet, that we lack Clerval's journal might in context seem strange. The entire novel
                     is based on the presence of an overload of documentary information that includes the
                     letters of Alphonse Frankenstein and Elizabeth Lavenza, the journal letter of Robert
                     Walton, his representation of Victor's narrative (dutifully "corrected" by Victor),
                     which in turn contains the Creature's narrative, which is, in part, attested to by
                     the letters of Felix that the Creature promised to leave with Victor when he finished.
                     If we lack this last piece of evidence, however, we do not lack its effect on the
                     narrative, since Victor here calls attention to the nature and quality of Clerval's
                     writing. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10073"><span class="term">Jura opposing its dark side </span> The Jura massif runs to the northwest of Geneva and serves as a natural barrier to
                  an armed adventure from neighboring France. This is clearly a reference to the French
                  invasion of Switzerland in the spring of 1798, when, it must be said, the Jura wholly
                  failed in this protective office. Still, why such a strong political sentiment should
                  be intruded by Victor Frankenstein at this point is not readily explicable. Perhaps
                  what the reader is intended to recognize is that Victor's distancing himself within
                  a political context allows him to forget the last time all these features of the landscape
                  were brought together by him in a single perspective, the night he first encountered
                  his Creature outside Geneva (I:6:17). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10080"><span class="term">in justice, or even in possibility </span> Questions of justice have entered this novel from various directions, spanning the
                  Creature's plea for a mate (II:9:2, II:9:8) to the condemnation of Justine Moritz
                  (I:7:1). What may be most interesting about Walton's invocation of the term is his
                  implicit understanding of the notion of disinterested equity, a notion wholly absent
                  from the closed circle of antagonism in which Victor and his Creature exist. For Mary
                  Shelley to introduce such a concept this late in the novel might suggest an effort
                  on her part to establish an ethical code by which readers can take the measure of
                  the novel's characters and events. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10087"><span class="term">I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri </span> Mary Shelley's History of a Six Weeks' Tour recounts her visit to Lucerne and Uri.
                  </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10094"><span class="term">a singularly variegated landscape </span> Although Mary Shelley depends for the description here principally on her own observations,
                  Byron's representation of the Rhine landscape as a point in nature where one might
                  observe a symbolic reconciliation of opposite powers in harmonious symmetry (see Childe
                  Harold's Pilgrimage, Canto 3, stanzas 59-61) seems to touch her conception here. That
                  representation, in any case, would not be far from her mind, since it was written
                  in the summer of 1816 and, indeed, when the Shelleys returned to England they carried
                  the manuscript of the poem with them. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10101"><span class="term">that language </span> Victor's sudden reminder of the instability of language throughout the novel also
                  serves to link linguistic difference with the notion of an alienated identity, a condition
                  that from now on he will share with his Creature. The Creature's vow to make Victor
                  equally miserable first unfolds on a psychological plain. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10108"><span class="term">last autumn </span> This is another sign of the mistaken chronology at this point in the narrative. The
                  previous autumn Victor spent awaiting his trial. What Elizabeth is referring to is
                  actually the late summer—the aftermath of the August trip to Mont Blanc—of the previous
                  year. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10115"><span class="term">a small quantity of laudanum </span> This revelation helps greatly to explain Victor's manic changes of mood, from almost
                  delirious emotionality to an impassive lethargy. Laudanum, a form of liquified opium,
                  was a narcotic freely available in the latter part of the eighteenth century. In those
                  days its usage lacked the social stigma that would be attached to it by later cultures
                  and it was commonly employed in all stations of society. Thomas DeQuincey's Confessions
                  of an English Opium-Eater was published in its first version in two installments of
                  the London Magazine in 1821, three years after the publication of Frankenstein, making
                  his literary reputation overnight. Percy Bysshe Shelley seems to have used laudanum
                  to dull the pain of the chronic nephritis from which he suffered. Mary Shelley, however,
                  was also well aware of the more consequential abuses to which laudanum lent itself.
                  Her half-sister, Fanny Imlay, the daughter of Mary Wollstonecraft and the American
                  Gilbert Imlay, committed suicide by an overdose of laudanum in November of 1816, while
                  Mary Shelley was still in the early stages of her novel. Thus, this detail must be
                  seen as colored by that tragic event. At the very least, it is a further indication
                  of the deep instability of Victor Frankenstein's mind at this juncture of his career.

               <li class="item" id="d30e10122"><span class="term">I cannot lead them unwillingly to danger </span> Despite the bitter dejection recorded at the beginning of this entry to the letter,
                  Walton recognizes the essential justice of a contract mutually agreed to and refuses
                  to use the arbitrary authority contemporary law put in his hands to force the mariners
                  to fulfill his purposes. The emphasis on the adverbial "unwillingly" carries political
                  as well as ethical connotations. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10130"><span class="term">the lessons of my father </span> Victor is at this point twenty-five years old and seemingly beyond the necessity
                  of instruction in the nature of human affairs. The distance, in attitude and experience,
                  between father and son stands without comment, although Victor's silence at the beginning
                  of this scene of patriarchal instruction is indicative of how unbridgeable we may
                  presume has become the gap that divides them. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10137"><span class="term">the letters of Felix and Safie </span> These were the letters Safie wrote Felix imploring his aid in the rescue of her father
                  from prison and that she had translated from Turkish into French. In recounting this
                  episode, the Creature had promised to give Victor the copies he had made of them (II:6:7),
                  and this offhand reference suggests that he did so. The logical completion of that
                  strand of the narrative does not, of course, explain just why Victor Frankenstein,
                  embarked on an odyssey of epic proportions where he can scarcely provide himself with
                  the essentials of life, is carrying the translated correspondence of a perfect stranger.

               <li class="item" id="d30e10144"><span class="term">liberty had been a useless gift </span> In Mary Shelley's households, whether living with her husband or her father, liberty
                  is the greatest of human gifts. For Victor to call it useless speaks volumes about
                  the deterioration of his mind and sensibility. It also subtly links his present mental
                  condition to his continuing sloughing off of personal responsibility upon an abstract
                  and transcendental destiny. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10151"><span class="term">until my own life, or that of my adversary, were extinguished </span> Mary Shelley here offers another accentuation of the adversarial masculinist code
                  that has dominated Victor's perspective on his Creature and blinded him to the dangers
                  to which he has exposed his loved ones. The melodramatic posturing, it should be emphasized,
                  does have a purpose if we remind ourselves that this first-person narrative is delivered
                  to a listener, Robert Walton, who at the end of the next chapter will reenter the
                  novel. Since Victor is well aware that Walton is preserving this record as an exemplary
                  warning to later human generations, he has every reason to try to influence the portrait
                  thus handed down to the future. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10158"><span class="term">Light, feeling, and sense, will pass away </span> In contemplating his end, the Creature logically reverts to the memory of his first
                  sensations as he became conscious of the world around him (II:3:1 and note). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10165"><span class="term">listless indolence </span> 
                  <p>The near-catatonic state in which Victor exists is a sign of profound mental disturbance:
                     Mary Shelley's repetition of the word "listless" from the chapter's beginning indicates
                     that Victor leaves in the same state in which he has existed since his interview with
                     the Creature: compare III:1:1 and note. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10174"><span class="term">I passed whole days . . . silent and listless </span> 
                  <p>Victor has returned to the desultory sailing on Lake Geneva that occupied him earlier
                     in the summer (II:1:5 and note). To be "listless" is literally to be without desire.
                     </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10183"><span class="term">lost in darkness and distance </span> The novel closes with a fine symmetry, repeating the verbal form ("lost") with which
                  the Creature had disappeared from view in Volume 1 (I:L4:3) and Volume 2 (II:9:18).
                  Given its profound association with the epic of Milton that so haunts this work, that
                  term may be thought to be a marker for the Creature's entire existence. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10190"><span class="term">Do you not love another? </span> At this juncture in the novel few readers would not be startled by the aptness of
                  this question, even if none would construe the passion that consumes Victor as in
                  any conventional sense, whether erotic or paternal, that of love. Whatever the problems
                  of the fictional time scheme, it is apparent that for the past four-and-a-half years,
                  which is the lifetime of Victor's offspring, not to neglect the months of concentrated
                  labor that went into his gestation, Victor has been obsessed with the Creature to
                  the neglect, even destruction, of any other relationship. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10197"><span class="term">I should be supposed mad </span> Given the past consequences on his friends and family of Victor's silence, particularly
                  in his never explaining to Clerval the possible danger to his existence from accompanying
                  him to Britain, Victor's continuing reticence seems perverse. Yet, at the same time,
                  when he is driven at last to depose himself to the law, the fact that he is treated
                  with patronizing incredulity and wholly exonerated from any responsibility for the
                  wake of destruction that has visited his family circle (see III:6:24), is a subtle
                  touch on Mary Shelley's part. Conventional human expectation, of necessity, protects
                  itself from whatever is beyond its normal range of experience. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10204"><span class="term">Are you mad . . . ? </span> Alphonse Frankenstein had raised exactly the same question with Victor at the beginning
                  of the fifth chapter (III.5.5), and the Genevan magistrate seems to have been assured
                  of the matter from his interview at the end of the sixth (III.6.28). For readers who
                  by this point in the novel might well have come to the same conclusion, Victor's questioning
                  of Walton's mental stability would venture on the absurd. From the larger perspective
                  of the novel's development, however, the strange echo emphasizes how relative, given
                  the acute isolation in which its three male protagonists have come to exist, have
                  become all grounds of reason and normalcy. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10212"><span class="term">the mad enthusiasm </span> As elsewhere in these paragraphs the candor of Victor's language is unexpected and
                  surprising. Earlier in his narration he has used "enthusiasm" as an apology, even
                  perhaps as a cover for his lack of responsibility (see I:3:3, I:3:8, I:3:14, and III:2:21).
                  This linking of his obsession with creating life to a state of madness will be reinforced
                  near the end of the novel where Victor will reflect on his endeavor as a "fit of enthusiastic
                  madness" (III:Walton:28). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10219"><span class="term">a maddening rage </span> The language seems scrupulously chosen to indicate a transference of madness into
                  the obsession of revenge: which is to say that, though his vindictiveness allows Victor
                  to focus his mind wholly on this pursuit, the aim may nonetheless be construed as
                  insane. After the death of Elizabeth and his father, Victor seems not so much to recover
                  his mental health as to concentrate his madness. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10226"><span class="term">my mad schemes are the cause </span> The notion of madness, encountered frequently in the late chapters of the novel,
                  has been associated almost entirely with Victor Frankenstein's disturbed mental state.
                  This small shift in rhetoric for the 1831 edition, coming as it does eight paragraphs
                  after Victor's impassioned questioning of Walton's naive desire to know "the particulars
                  of his creature's formation" ("Are you mad, my friend . . . ?"—see III:Walton:3 and
                  note), suggests that, for this novel, madness may be less a matter of actual derangement
                  than it is a kind of violation of accepted codes of social conduct whereby the individual
                  becomes isolated from the community and communal obligations. Its closest synonymn
                  might then be "solipsism," which is an issue with deep roots within Romanticism and
                  one that is stressed in these final pages of Frankenstein. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10233"><span class="term">magistrate . . . benevolent man </span> As a magistrate, Mr. Kirwin, who treats all people with equity and compassion, contrasts
                  with the Geneva judges who condemned Justine Moritz to death (I:7:14) as well as the
                  rigged Paris tribunal that pronounced a like sentence on Safie's father (II:6:3).
                  There is likewise to be observed here a curious symmetry, since at the other end of
                  Victor's trip to the British Isles is another magistrate who, in effect, authorized
                  it, Alphonse Frankenstein. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10240"><span class="term">the main land </span> The Orkney Islands begin just north of John O'Groats, the point of Caithness that
                  is commonly considered the northernmost point in the United Kingdom. There are several
                  small islands between this village and Pomona, the largest of the Orkneys. Exactitude
                  is impossible here, however, because Pomona is itself popularly known as Mainland.

                  <p>Oxford is famous for the way in which the structures of the university rise above
                     other features of the landscape to dominate the horizon. In the late nineteenth century
                     Thomas Hardy paints an enduring picture of the young Jude Fawley, the hero of Jude
                     the Obscure who has mythicized what is there denominated Christminster, venturing
                     far out of his village and climbing a ladder at sunset with the hope of making out
                     this far-off object of all his desires: </p> 
                  <p>Some way within the limits of the stretch of landscape, points of light like the topaz
                     gleamed. The air increased in transparency with the lapse of minutes, till the topaz
                     points showed themselves to be the vanes, windows, wet roof slates, and other shining
                     spots upon the spires, domes, freestone-work, and varied outlines that were faintly
                     revealed. It was Christminster, unquestionably; either directly seen, or miraged in
                     the peculiar atmosphere.</p> 
                  <p>The spectator gazed on till the windows and vanes lost their shine, going out almost
                     suddenly like extinguished candles. The vague city became veiled in mist. (I.iii)</p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10260"><span class="term">I can make you so wretched </span> Resuming the earlier play on the meanings of "wretch" and "wretched," the Creature
                  once again turns Victor's own terminology back on him. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10267"><span class="term">maladie du pays </span> Home-sickness. Why Victor should lapse into his native tongue here, the single such
                  instance in his lengthy account to Walton, is a mystery. Perhaps it is meant as another
                  instance of his euphemisms, suggestive of an essential insincerity in his representation
                  of his motives. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10274"><span class="term">call on the manes </span> The Oxford English Dictionary nicely captures the rationale for Victor's use of this
                  Latinism, defining the term in the plural, as the deified souls of departed ancestors
                  (as beneficent spirits; opposed to larvæ and lemures, the malevolent shades of the
                  Lower World). Also, the spirit, `shade' of a departed person, considered as an object
                  of homage or reverence, or as demanding to be propitiated by vengeance. The manes
                  Victor lists here have in the aggregate constituted the guiding spirits that throughout
                  this chapter he has invoked as demanding his intercession to avenge their deaths.
                  Upon his own death he foresees himself joining their number. If Walton is expected
                  to pick up the family cause, perhaps in thinking of Victor as "the brother of [his]
                  heart" (I:L4:22) he has got much more than he bargained for. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10281"><span class="term">the mark of the fingers </span> Victor recalls the account of William's death contained in his father's letter of
                  May 12th in the previous year (I:6:6). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10288"><span class="term">the martyrs of old </span> Once again Victor's sense of his own heroism intrudes on the discourse to transform
                  what could be construed as unfeeling, sordid, or insane into a grand and self-exculpating
                  gesture. Martyrs, we may remind ourselves, however their acts may be justified, are
                  by their nature suicidal. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10296"><span class="term">I am your master </span> Portending a reversal of the father-son roles both Victor and the Creature have implicitly
                  relied on, this assertion of the Creature's power contrasts markedly with Victor's
                  chronic indecision and impotence. From this point on, as this language intimates,
                  both are locked in the embrace of their mutual anatagonism. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10303"><span class="term">Of what materials was I made </span> The word "materials" is the euphemism Victor customarily uses for the human and animal
                  parts out of which he constructs the beings to which he intends to impart life. Now
                  reduced to a psychological wretchedness, his physical being seems to him equivalent
                  to these shards of undifferentiated flesh. Mary Shelley subtly reaffirms Victor's
                  growing identification with his miserable Creature. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10310"><span class="term">8th of May </span> 
                  <p>The timetable seems seriously awry at this point. Henry Clerval was murdered in late
                     August. Victor's subsequent breakdown forced a two-month delay during which his father
                     was summoned, and the trial seems to have transpired about a month after Alphonse
                     Frankenstein's arrival. This would put it in the December following the summer's removal
                     to the Orkney Islands. Victor's release from prison ensued in a fortnight (III:4:44),
                     and he records that thereafter he and his father left Ireland as speedily as they
                     could (III:4:48). Thus, the arrival in Paris should come some four months earlier
                     than Elizabeth's letter makes it. This error is attenuated in the first edition, we
                     may remember, by a similar lapse of time in the trip to England, where, though it
                     appears that Victor and Henry begin their trip down the Rhine in early September,
                     they are not reported as having crossed the channel until the "latter days of September
                     " (III:1:24). </p> 
                  <p>Scrutiny of the surviving manuscripts suggests that Mary Shelley had her chronology
                     straight the first time around and for some reason changed her mind and then, again,
                     subsequently compounded the confusion. In the draft she originally had Victor and
                     his father arrive in Le Havre on the "8th of Feb." and dated Elizabeth's letter from
                     Geneva "February 18th;" then in each case she crossed out the month, substituting
                     "May." In the fair copy intended for the printer, Elizabeth's letter was first dated
                     "April," but this designation was cancelled and replaced with "May 18th." </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10321"><span class="term">Mayence </span> A French spelling for Mainz. Mary Shelley uses this same form in A History of a Six
                  Weeks' Tour. Her description of the Rhine landscape at the same time of the year closely
                  parallels Frankenstein's account on this occasion. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10328"><span class="term">the mechanical impulse </span> A reader can empathize with the sense of relief with which Victor sheds his anxious,
                  nervous state of mind in favor of a dogged determination. But the particular language
                  Mary Shelley uses here indicates that it is also a dogged determinism. In ridding
                  himself of anxiety and a sense of personal responsibility, Victor would seem to give
                  up his last shreds of humanity, transforming himself into a mere machinery of destruction,
                  an armament of war. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10335"><span class="term">an absorbing melancholy, that resembled madness </span> 
                  <p>The final third of the novel is going to concentrate much attention on the progressive
                     deterioration of Victor's mental health. Thus, in revising the novel, Mary Shelley
                     carefully implants at this crucial turn of events, when Victor once again plans to
                     depart the family circle, Alphonse Frankenstein's suspicion that his son may be deranged.</p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10344"><span class="term">satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory </span> Curiously, in this respect the Creature is the opposite of Victor Frankenstein, whom
                  he otherwise mirrors in so many aspects. Victor was so preoccupied with inscribing
                  his experiences in such a way as to exonerate himself that he corrected Walton's transcript
                  of his narration (III:Walton:4). Oddly enough, the only tangible memory that the Creature
                  existed is embodied in Walton's manuscript, of which he is ignorant. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10351"><span class="term">It is midnight </span> In folk traditions midnight is a time for supernatural events (the transformation
                  of Cinderella's coach into a pumpkin) or strange apparitions (witches, elves). It
                  was at midnight that Victor Frankenstein first encountered his Creature in the wild,
                  on his return to Geneva after the murder of William (I:6:25). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10358"><span class="term">wandering ministers of vengeance </span> Upon a moment's reflection the reader will recognize that Victor, by this term, means
                  the primitive Furies of classical myth. Their most prominent realization in Greek
                  literature is in Aeschylus's Oresteia, where, as enacted in the third part of the
                  trilogy, The Eumenides, the Furies are persuaded by Athena to give over their ritual
                  vengeance to a new and more civilized system of justice that will henceforth regulate
                  human behavior. For Victor thus to invoke the Furies suggests his reversion to a primitive
                  bloodlust incompatible with modern civilization. Although not yet written, P. B. Shelley's
                  representation of the Furies in Prometheus Unbound (see I.444), as psychological agents
                  of self-victimization who lacerate the psyche, is wholly in accord with Mary Shelley's
                  conception here. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10365"><span class="term">Miserable himself, that he may render no other wretched </span> This phrasing succinctly captures the closed circle in which the Creature and his
                  creator exist, miserable and incapable of producing anything else but misery. Its
                  terms are as applicable to the speaker as to the object of his hatred, as may be indicated
                  by the simple fact that Victor Frankenstein dies first. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10372"><span class="term">so miserable a wretch </span> This speech is closely linked in tone and diction with the point in Victor's narration
                  when, awaiting his trial in Ireland, he resolved on the destruction of his Creature
                  as the sole purpose of his future existence (III:4:43). Once again, we discern language
                  (e.g. "miserable," "wretch"), which was originally applied to the Creature (I:4:2,
                  I:4:3), then thrown back upon Victor by the Creature's taunts (III:7:7), operating
                  as a standard diction for his own self-reference. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10380"><span class="term">miserably pent . . . wretchedness </span> The ironic undertone of identification between Victor and his Creature continues
                  with the implication of how unfortunate it will be should Victor once more be "let
                  loose" upon the world. Here, the term by which Victor first denominated his Creature—wretch
                  (see I:4:2 and note)—which is descended from the Old English word for exile, is expanded
                  to encompass the entire world. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10387"><span class="term">miserable wretch </span> There is no sharper indication of the way in which doubling patterns operate in this
                  novel than the way in which this term shifts its application as the narrations unfold.
                  The two words are first juxtaposed by Victor as he contemplates his newly vivified
                  Creature (I:4:3). This exact phrase is then employed by the Creature (though, of course,
                  we must recall that in terms of strict chronology, his usage predates that of Victor's
                  narrative), as he tells of his sensations upon awakening on the first night of his
                  existence (II:3:2). Now it is he who applies it to Victor. In its final use Victor,
                  having internalized its truth, will invoke the term, in conversation with Walton,
                  to describe the total failure of his existence (III:Walton:9). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10394"><span class="term">miserable wretch </span> By this point in the novel's development, these terms have become interchangeably
                  shared by Victor Frankenstein and the Creature. Unconscious of his repetitive language,
                  Victor has named the Creature a "wretch" on first looking at him (see II:4:2) and,
                  again upon seeing him a second time, as the being approaches him across the Sea of
                  Ice (II:2:5). But he likewise refers to himself by the same term in the last sentence
                  of Volume 1 (I:7:33), and Elizabeth characterizes him similarly at the beginning of
                  the second volume (II:1:8). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10401"><span class="term">it modelled my feelings </span> Whether impelled by the verb "modelled" (1818) or "moulded" (1831), this is a fascinating
                  phrase. In the second case, although the revised edition lacks the epigraph from Milton's
                  Paradise Lost that marks the original title page ("Did I request thee, Maker, from
                  my clay / To mould me Man?"—X.743-44 ), Mary Shelley's recast diction seems to recall
                  it with a deliberate irony. In this reconstitution the new Adam, lacking all free
                  will, is animated by his own revenge, which is the pattern, the "mould," established
                  by Satan in Milton's epic. 
                  <p>On a mundane rather than cosmic level, however, we might want to contemplate what
                     it is to have one's entire emotional life formed by the sentiment of revenge? In accord
                     with the loss of "voluntary thought" mentioned in the previous sentence, Victor also
                     gives up any feeling, any instinctual sense of identification, that might lead him
                     away from his obsessive rage against his double. He thus confesses himself as being
                     wholly shaped, both intellectually and emotionally, by this bond of negation. As he
                     embarks on a pursuit of high adventure, he casts himself, ironically, as a totally
                     passive victim of his own choosing. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10410"><span class="term">the monster . . . the daemon </span> The interchangeability of this nomenclature is by this point in Victor's career habitual.
                  The Creature is thoroughly demonized in his mind. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10417"><span class="term">the monster of my creation </span> Of all Victor's terms for the being he has brought to life this seems the most directly
                  applicable to a true understanding of the dynamics that underlie the identification
                  of him as monstrous. No longer merely a "monster" in and of himself, here the Creature
                  is designated as being created in such a form. Victor thus tacitly acknowledges his
                  responsibility for making his Creature monstrous, whether in deed or by the mere utterance
                  of the word. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10424"><span class="term">apparition of the monster </span> The undertone in which the text, as Walton reasserts his control over it, questions
                  the statements of its narrators continues here as Walton twice—and in the formulation
                  of a logical proof ("conviction of the truth" . . . "Such a monster has then really
                  existence")—thoughtlessly borrows Victor's diction to describe the Creature. Careful
                  readers will remember that the "apparition . . . seen from our ship" was described
                  very differently at the time (I:L4:3). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10431"><span class="term">Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose </span> Since the rising of the moon is, like the dawning of the sun, a phenomenon marked
                  almost wholly by its gradual character, the reader can attribute this statement either
                  to Mary Shelley's desire for a gothic ambience or, more consistent with her art, to
                  Victor's overheated imagination. Since the previous paragraphs have, through the foreshortening
                  of time, already hinted at his surrender to mania, this could be intended as a further
                  example of the slippage of his sense of reality. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10438"><span class="term">his more than daughter </span> 
                  <p>In the 1818 edition Elizabeth is the daughter of Alphonse's deceased sister (see I:1:7).
                     Although in the 1831 edition her parentage is distanced, she retains this same designation
                     of being "more than daughter." The terms recall the rhetoric in which she herself,
                     in her dungeon, addressed Justine (see I:7:23). Even more so, they echo Victor's own
                     description of her in their youth, in the revised 1831 edition (see 1831:I:1:10),
                     and thus strongly suggest that there Mary Shelley was attempting to draw together
                     these linguistic echoes to emphasize the inbred, almost incestuous, closeness of the
                     family. As elsewhere, the echoes may intimate that the bourgeois domestic affections
                     are not an unmixed blessing. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10447"><span class="term">Towards morning . . . night-mare </span> This appears to be a further application of Coleridge's writings to the general tenor
                  of the novel. His "Pains of Sleep," in which he recounts the psychic repercussions
                  of a nightmare induced by opium, was published in 1816, shortly before Mary Shelley
                  began writing Frankenstein. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10454"><span class="term">the most distinguished natural philosophers </span> In general terms England was the center for scientific knowledge in the Europe of
                  the late Enlightenment. A major reason for this was the presence of the Royal Society
                  for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge, founded in 1660 shortly after the restoration
                  of Charles II: its periodical, Philosophical Transactions, was still in Mary Shelley's
                  day the principal scientific journal of the world. The president of the Royal Society
                  at the time of the publication of Frankenstein was Sir Joseph Banks, one of the great
                  explorers and botanists of the eighteenth century. Although Banks's diverse interests
                  would not have specifically engaged Victor Frankenstein, we can be sure that his example
                  would have been a guiding light for Walton. That of his successor, Sir Humphrey Davy,
                  however, would have equally drawn Victor's admiration, since he was perhaps the premier
                  scientist experimenting with the chemical effects of electricity in the first quarter
                  of the nineteenth century. 
                  <p>Percy Bysshe Shelley, it should be noted, attended a number of anatomical lectures
                     by John Abernethy in 1811. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10464"><span class="term">most miserable of mortals </span> The terms here have a strongly echoing effect, returning us to the language in which
                  the Creature and Victor acknowledged their similarities toward the end of the colloquy
                  on the Mer-de-Glace (II:8:36, II:9:2, II:9:5). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10471"><span class="term">motion of every muscle . . . extremities of my limbs </span> The oddity of this observation seems to be directly based in Victor's experience
                  as a physiologist. What the reader cannot miss, however, is the extent of self-absorption
                  that could lead a man in the process of discovering his wife's corpse to note his
                  own bodily symptoms with such detached scrupulosity. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10478"><span class="term">mutilated one </span> The irony of the previous sentence is here almost grotesquely intensified. The being
                  to whom Victor originally gave "life and spirit" was so horribly mutilated in his
                  creation as to provoke universal aversion from all whom he met. Now, in the text,
                  Victor hopes in some way to rectify that lack of initial perspective and clean up
                  either what he once called his "filthy creation" (I:3:9), or lacking success at that
                  aim, at least his own image. The secondary irony is that neither he nor his Creature
                  can expect an individual "posterity" since each has denied the other the possibility
                  of procreation. The posterity that will determine their lasting reputations is thus
                  composed solely of readers of the present text that Victor is so assiduously determined
                  to rewrite. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10485"><span class="term">the fears I entertained of a mutiny </span> These are by no means unfounded fears. The notorious mutiny of Henry Hudson's crew
                  during his fourth voyage to the north in 1611 resulted in the renowned explorer's
                  death. Even so late as his polar exploration of 1829, Sir John Ross experienced a
                  mutiny on one of its ships. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10492"><span class="term">to shake off my chains </span> This conception of slavery as a psychological as well as physical condition is very
                  much of a piece with other literary productions by the Geneva circle during the summer
                  of 1816, most particularly The Prisoner of Chillon, written by Lord Byron in the week
                  after he and Percy Bysshe Shelley visited the Castle of Chillon during their boat
                  trip around the lake in mid-July. Shelley included an account in the letters he appended
                  to A History of a Six Weeks' Tour. In Byron's poem, at the end of his long captivity,
                  François de Bonnivard, the prisoner, claims, "It was at length the same to me, / Fetter'd
                  or fetterless to be" (lines 372-73) and ruefully notes, in much the same language
                  as Victor employs here, that "iron is a cankering thing, / For in these limbs its
                  teeth remain, / With marks that will not wear away" (lines 38-40). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10499"><span class="term">my destiny . . . close </span> The wrenching shift in narrative stance into a present "now" accentuates the difference
                  subtly in play up to this moment between Victor's self-accusations and his actual
                  avowal of culpability. The man talking to his father knows that he is innocent of
                  the crime for which he is languishing in jail. The one speaking in Walton's cabin
                  nearly three years later, in contrast, has locked the key on his own imprisonment.
                  </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10506"><span class="term">such is not my destiny </span> Victor reiterates what he has said before (III:4:43, III:7:5), accentuating the reader's
                  strong sense that he has built a conceptual prison around himself. If the purpose
                  of one's life is solely to bring death to another, then the notion of a vital or life
                  force has been systematically inverted. Such a psychological condition is clearly
                  pathological. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10513"><span class="term">what were my duties with regard to this destroyer </span> "Duty" has been a charged concept throughout Frankenstein, invoked in regard to family
                  affairs, social obligations, legal contracts, uses of knowledge—even, in Victor's
                  rationale for suspending his second creation, the human race. This occasion is different
                  from all the rest, involving the question of what is the moral duty of a human to
                  another sentient but alien being. This assertion of the priority of moral obligation
                  requires willed self-abnegation on Walton's part. No other figure in the novel, certainly
                  not Victor Frankenstein, has ever assumed that the Creature was owed anything. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10520"><span class="term">my eyes . . . death </span> Whatever the accruing psychological similarities between Victor and his Creature,
                  this is the first indication that Victor is also growing into his physical counterpart.
                  Perhaps, these signs of death are to be read from a moral perspective, as indicating
                  how deeply implicated with spiritual decay is Victor's retreat from normal human interaction.
                  </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10527"><span class="term">my fiendish enemy. </span> Victor first designates his creature as an "enemy" shortly after his creation (I:4:12),
                  and the Creature, in turn, after the collapse of his aspirations with the DeLacey's
                  thinks of Victor in a like capacity (II:8:30). Throughout this last chapter, however,
                  Victor has conceptualized his Creature wholly in adversarial terms, again and again
                  referring to him as an enemy. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10534"><span class="term">my friends </span> The plural form appears to indicate that Victor has deduced from the sympathetic
                  concern of the benevolent Mr. Kirwin that he is as true a friend to him as his father.
                  </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10542"><span class="term">it was to be my grave. </span> As earlier in the chapter (III:3:19), Victor's egotism is a barrier to his recognizing
                  where the actual threats to his well-being are lodged. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10549"><span class="term">they all died by my hands </span> This is a further instance in which Victor's new level of candor is striking in its
                  unblinking justice. Although it is easy to dismiss this language as characteristically
                  hyperbolic and histrionic, to do so without maintaining a regard for the intensification
                  of his self-understanding would be unjust. The sense of connectedness he now acknowledges
                  with his Creature will become the distinguishing feature of the last movement of the
                  novel. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10556"><span class="term">my imagination . . . sting me </span> As on several earlier occasions in the novel (see I:3:11, I:4:18, I:6:24) the Romantic
                  imagination is here connected with inner torment rather than transcendence. Instead
                  of regenerating the psychic economy, the imagination preys across its isolated and
                  wholly enclosed spaces. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10563"><span class="term">My letter was calm and affectionate </span> A less calming letter could scarcely have been written to a fiancée who had not heard
                  from her lover for the better part of two years. Perhaps, Mary Shelley writes with
                  her tongue in her cheek, wishing to stress the strange air of unreality that has become
                  habitual by now with Victor. His idea of "perfect confidence," after all, is to let
                  on that he has a "dreadful" secret and then to require that Elizabeth not ask him
                  a word about it. The irony is lost on him, though one assumes not on the reader. Unfortunately
                  for Elizabeth, she, indeed, never questions him about his odd revelation. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10570"><span class="term">my misfortunes, and their cause </span> No reader can miss the tone here, as Elizabeth's murder is abstracted into merely
                  another item in Victor's pitiful history of sorrows. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10577"><span class="term">my vow was heard, and that I was reserved for vengeance </span> The supposition with which this graveyard scene commenced has now hardened into conviction.
                  But surely Mary Shelley emphasizes her irony here, that the sign that Victor's vow
                  has been heard is not some apparition from the dead he would avenge but rather the
                  laugh of the Creature. It is, then, specifically the Creature who reserves Victor's
                  remaining months for vengeance. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10584"><span class="term">my wanderings </span> Another important theme of the novel and of the age here resonates in Victor's seemingly
                  innocuous phrase. As the Ancient Mariner of Coleridge has been invoked on several
                  occasions in the novel, the reader may here wish to see Victor, in his passive surrender
                  to his obsession, as willingly assuming that character's fate. But the idea goes considerably
                  beyond Coleridge's prototype. The notion of the Wandering Jew, cursed to be an eternal
                  vagabond for having taunted Christ on his way to the cross, stands behind both Coleridge's
                  and Mary Shelley's conceptions; and, indeed, that myth may be being evoked here on
                  a particularly subtle level, as Victor's turning his back on his own will to live
                  assumes a psychological counterpart to that taunting of the figure of redemption.
                  The poet figure of Percy Shelley's "Alastor" (1815), who wanders over some of the
                  same terrain as Victor in search of his visionary love, suggests yet another context.
                  Behind that figure is probably another conceptual avatar, the peddler in Wordsworth's
                  Excursion (1814) who is explicitly named the Wanderer, and who in that poet's conception
                  is able through his internal poise and just relationship with his natural environment
                  to maintain his balance amid the turbulence of life. Neither of the Shelleys had much
                  respect for that poem, but, needless to say, Victor's balance in contrast to that
                  of Wordsworth's peddler is seriously awry. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10591"><span class="term">my wretchedness </span> Once again, the Creature reverses Victor's assignment of "wretchedness," affirming
                  that it is the state he is forced to inhabit, not the condition he wishes to perpetrate
                  on human society. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10598"><span class="term">Nature </span> This is the only point in the 1818 edition where Nature is capitalized to give it
                  a quasi-transcendental significance. By the 1831 edition this practice is extended

                  <p>This would suggest that the date is in early August, since it was "in the latter end

               <li class="item" id="d30e10614"><span class="term">its deadly weight yet hanging around my neck </span> 
                  <p>Although this language may sound proverbial, we are actually witness here to the actual
                     occurrence of a cultural transformation into proverbial status. The reference is,
                     once again, specifically to Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner," where the dead
                     albatross is hung around the Mariner's neck in the last stanza of Part 2, not to be
                     removed until the end of Part 4. Although the overtone of Victor's comment is light,
                     it does return us to the isolation of the far northern seas where this story is being
                     told and where earlier Coleridge's poem was invoked for analogy by Walton (I:L2:6).
                     It may also remind us of the morning after the Creature's endowment with life (I:4:7)
                     when Victor's sense of being haunted first descends on him. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10624"><span class="term">new and dear objects of care will be born </span> This statement carries a subtle resonance, reminding us that this was exactly the
                  fear Victor entertained of his Creature if he were allowed a mate, except that his
                  perspective on those "dear objects of care" was of "a race of devils [being] propagated
                  upon the earth" (III:3:2 and note). Immersed as he is in irony, Victor does not notice
                  the similarity between his state and that of his Creature. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10631"><span class="term">the new town </span> The area to the north of the old town, between the Castle and the Firth of Forth,
                  was developed during the eighteenth century and rapidly became the center of the vital
                  cultural and intellectual life of the "Scottish Enlightenment." When Percy Bysshe
                  Shelley and his first wife Harriet eloped to Edinburgh at the end of August 1811,
                  they took lodgings in George Street in New Town. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10638"><span class="term">nicer eye </span>Nice here bears the significance of sense 12a of the Oxford English Dictionary: "Entering
                  minutely into details; attentive, close." Elizabeth's frankness and perspicuity are
                  testified to earlier by Victor upon his return to Geneva after William's murder (see
                  I:6:41). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10645"><span class="term">O Night, and by the spirits that preside over thee </span> In all conventional mythologies Night is a figure of discord and threat. As she appears
                  in Book I of Spenser's Faerie Queene, she is represented as "griesly Night, with visage
                  deadly sad" (I.5.172), testifying that "I the mother bee/ Of falshood" (I.5.240-41).
                  The eldest of divinities, she has unimpeded access to the depths of Hell. In Paradise
                  Lost Night dwells with Chaos in the "dark/ Illimitable ocean without bound" (II.891-92)
                  from which God creates Hell. Whatever Victor thinks he is doing by solemnly invoking
                  Night to aid him in his revenge, it is clear, by all traditional associations, that
                  no good will come of it. 
                  <p>The observant reader may recall that the Creature invoked figures associated with
                     the daytime in swearing before Victor that, if he were given a partner, he would never
                     trouble his maker again (see II:9:17). </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10654"><span class="term">I had no choice but to adapt my nature </span> As the Creature laments over Victor, he unwittingly uses language with which we have
                  become familar through Victor's own usage. Here, it is the terminology of destiny.
                  There is, however, an added recognition on his part that the course he embarked on
                  was "willingly chosen," which is an acknowledgement that Victor would have been wont
                  to suppress. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10661"><span class="term">no creature . . . history of man </span> Victor's lot is doubtless a hard one, but the hyperbole by which he inflates it to
                  a unique status in human annals is surely self-serving, the more so as this summary
                  comes at so determined a break in the narrative thread. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10668"><span class="term">for the guilty there is no peace </span> Victor's self-conviction is once again expressed with neither mitigating excuses
                  nor any sense of possible future exoneration. For him, truly, guilt has become a constant
                  state of mind. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10675"><span class="term">I would not lead them further north </span> 
                  <p>The association of the north with the realm of Satan is deeply embedded in Christian
                     mythology, perhaps justifying Dante's depiction of the lowest circle of Hell, in which
                     Satan is trapped, as ice-bound. Certainly, in Paradise Lost Milton knowingly exploits
                     this association, as at the very moment in which Satan's revolt against God materializes
                     he retreats to the north: </p> 
                  <p>          Assemble thou <br/> Of all those myriads which we lead the chief; <br/> Tell them, that by command, ere yet dim night <br/> Her shadowy cloud withdraws, I am to haste, <br/> And all who under me their banners wave, <br/> Homeward, with flying march, where we possess <br/> The quarters of the north; there to prepare <br/> Fit entertainment to receive our King, <br/> The great Messiah. (V.683-91)</p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10704"><span class="term">I shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe </span> Mary Shelley gives her Creature the honor of discovering the North Pole over a century
                  before the first human explorer reached it. She does so, however, not just for the
                  sake of irony, but to complete a figurative line that has spanned the novel from Walton's
                  first letter (I:L1:2) on and has underscored the linkage of Walton and Victor Frankenstein.
                  The Creature, who was brought to life by a fiery electric charge, intends through
                  fire to resign his being into the pure electromagnetic field of the pole. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10711"><span class="term">you do not credit my narrative </span> Mary Shelley here achieves a fine balance herself between crediting and subverting
                  the narrative. On the one hand, her readers (not to exclude Walton) have been at the
                  mercy of this autobiographical account for the better course of the novel. Its "connectedness"
                  is in great part what keeps them reading on. Yet there is the lingering hint of madness
                  threading its way through the narrative and impinging on its claims to reliability.
                  That Victor manages to convince Walton of its truth before the actual evidence appears
                  is, in the face of the skepticism he arouses here, rather an achievement. But then,
                  we might wish to remind ourselves that Walton is an habitué of adventure stories and
                  was wont to believe the North Pole a "region of beauty and delight" (I:L1:2). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10718"><span class="term">You will not hear </span> It goes without saying that if Margaret Saville hears nothing of her brother's fate,
                  we will never read this novel. Thus, even as Walton is apprehensive about his future,
                  we know that he will survive. This is something more, however, than a conventional
                  expression of fear or a plea for pity, being rather another instance of Mary Shelley's
                  accentuating the instability of her text and the innumerable contingencies surrounding
                  all authorship, whether we think of the result as her novel or Victor's Creature.
                  </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10726"><span class="term">I am not mad </span> Mary Shelley's concentration on this issue brings the reader to an awareness that,
                  where an entire culture refuses to believe in the truth of the aberrant, it may appear
                  mad even when it is not technically so. Or, as the British psychoanalyst of the 1970s,
                  R. D. Laing, tried to argue, it is possible to believe that those we call mad are
                  merely reacting sanely to the inherently mad stresses forced upon them by modern civilization.
                  It is those who have no awareness of them who truly constitute the mad. In this case
                  the public position of those who seem to value Victor's intellectual integrity but
                  dismiss his self-accusations, first Mr. Kirwin and then his own father, allows us
                  to read them as representatives of a reigning cultural establishment that, however
                  well-meaning it may be, may at the same time appear willfully blind. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10733"><span class="term">Daniel Nugent </span> Catherine Nugent was the landlady with whom Percy Bysshe Shelley and his first wife
                  Harriet resided during their short visit to Dublin in the spring of 1812. Both the
                  Shelleys maintained a correspondence with her thereafter. The fact that Harriet, not
                  Percy Shelley, informed Catherine Nugent of the rupture of their marriage suggests,
                  perhaps, that of the two she felt the closer ties. Mary Shelley, however, never met
                  Catherine Nugent, and there is no reference to her anywhere in her writings or in
                  her husband's correspondence with her. Thus, the presence of the surname Nugent in
                  this novel comes as something of a surprise that has never been explained. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10740"><span class="term">offspring of solitude and delirium </span> Walton is taking very seriously the notion of the living dead whom Victor accounted
                  a "guiding spirit" (III:7:26 and note) as he embarked on the Arctic ice fields. Yet
                  what he appears to be telling his sister and her readers here is that Victor's only
                  solace is in madness, and that for so deeply alienated a creature madness is preferable
                  to sanity. If by this statement he is recognizing that Victor is actually mad, it
                  raises considerable questions about what constitutes the truth contained by either
                  narrative—Victor's, certainly, but also his own which relies exclusively on Victor's
                  for its authority. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10747"><span class="term">one of the remotest of the Orkneys </span> The Orkney Islands, or Orcades, long a Norse dependency, were joined to Scotland
                  in 1472. There are eight principal islands, as well as other smaller ones of the type
                  Victor chooses: in all, the group amounts to seventy islands. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10754"><span class="term">our circle will be small </span> Alphonse seems incapable of thinking outside the terms of an enclosed, bourgeois
                  family unit. It is his point of stable reference throughout the novel (see also I:1:28,
                  I:6:2). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10761"><span class="term">I would rather . . . friendless outcast over the earth </span> Here, as Victor recognizes how wholly inverted was truth from expectation, the ironies
                  become heavy indeed, for, however extreme his rhetoric, he seems wholly unconscious
                  that this is the fate he has bestowed upon his Creature. And given that what he utters
                  here comes with the burden of a sudden shift to the total retrospect of Walton's cabin,
                  he seems strangely unable to acknowledge that this is the fate he has bestowed upon
                  himself as well. From a few days after the marriage onward, Victor does, in fact,
                  desert Switzerland for ever to pursue the Creature far and wide across national borders,
                  the two of them sharing a state of permanent "exile." </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10768"><span class="term">I wished to be participated </span> 
                  <p>This curious locution calls attention to itself, and it would seem purposefully so,
                     as being distinctively Miltonic. It is a verb used by Adam in Paradise Lost when pleading
                     with God to create a second being with whom he can share his existence:      </p> 
                  <p>Of fellowship I speak <br/> Such as I seek, fit to participate <br/> All rational delight: wherein the brute <br/> Cannot be human consort. (VIII.389-92)</p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10786"><span class="term">I may still be misled by passion </span> A final insistence on a continuing revision of the text, this phrase suggests that
                  even at the end Victor cannot be sure that he responds to anything concerning his
                  own situation with total disinterestedness. His frank admission is touching in its
                  expression of a simple, unapologetic humanity. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10793"><span class="term">the peasant </span> The powerless of this unlanded peasant before the forces of state power probably
                  reflects the devastation of Europe during the last phase of the Napoleonic Wars. However
                  self-serving or self-pitying we may find Victor's comparison, its political edge is
                  unmistakable and is perhaps intended by Mary Shelley, like other incidental political
                  observations in the novel, to insinuate a viewpoint that could not be explicitly stated
                  in the political climate of England in 1818. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10800"><span class="term">the most perfect solitude </span> 
                  <p>If the reader regards this phrase ironically, it would seem commensurate (or nearly
                     so) with death. The last third of Frankenstein is dominated by the withdrawal of its
                     protagonists behind psychic barricades that wall them off increasingly from the forces
                     of life. Again, one senses the context of P.B. Shelley's recently-published Alastor;
                     or, The Spirit of Solitude behind Mary Shelley's text. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10809"><span class="term">That then was the period </span> The "then" reveals Victor distancing himself from the sense that there will be any
                  immediate consequences to his act. His susceptibility to dismiss, or just miss, the
                  logical point, however, is not so much the result of chronic thick-headedness as it
                  is the effect of the egotism through which he filters all experience. His characteristic
                  assignment of a "destiny" to himself likewise testifies as much to his sense of self-importance
                  as to the determinism by which he attempts to deflect moral responsibility for his
                  actions from himself. </li>

                  marks, foreshadows the plot with a heavy ominousness. We perhaps have forgotten by
                  this point that on this issue there has been a much earlier foreshadowing, as in I:L4:26.

                     razed until the year of Frankenstein's publication. The city is located on the river
                     Tay some twenty miles southwest of Dundee, where Mary Shelley spent nearly two years
                     -- from June 1812 to March 1814 -- at the home of the Baxter family. </p> </li>

                  chapters, it may come as something of a relief to acknowledge that he is still as
                  scientifically alert to the representations of physiognomy as he was shen he dismissed
                  Dr. Krempe's credentials on that basis (see I:2:12). </li>

               <li class="item" id="d30e10854"><span class="term">my heart was poisoned with remorse </span> This may seem a strange usage, but it accords with the primary meaning of "remorse"
                  in Mary Shelley's day. Johnson's Dictionary (1755) lists the following two definitions:
                  
                  <ul>
                     <li class="item" id="d30e10860">Pain of guilt </li>

                  </ul> In both cases, but particularly in the first, remorse involves a passionate suffering
                  that could be likened to the action of poison. </li>

                  <p>Portsmouth was at this time the principal commercial port of the south of England,
                     maintaining a constant traffic between it and France. For a Londoner the normal crossing
                     would have been via Kent, from Dover to Calais; but embarkation from Portsmouth would
                     have been preferable for voyagers coming, like Alphonse and Victor, from the west
                     of England. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10874"><span class="term">to post </span> To post means going overland in vehicles drawn by horses. Mary Shelley copies the

                  Rhine after Cologne and proceeded on the final leg of their continental excursion

               <li class="item" id="d30e10881"><span class="term">my power is complete </span> This curious phrase recalls us to the last colloquy between Victor and his Creature
                  after the destruction of Victor's second being. There, asserting his mastery over
                  Victor, the Creature claims that he will attain this "power" (III:3:11), which is
                  that of reducing Victor to the state of utter wretchedness he has now reached. </li>

                     mental stability, we may see this careful planning between father and fiancée as reflecting
                     a shared concern that Victor not be left alone to indulge what they see as a tendency
                     toward melancholy, or, in his own characterization, "lonely, maddening reflection."
                     Even his seemingly innocent adjective here ("maddening") takes on added weight in
                     the depiction of Clerval as a kind of chaperon to ensure the preservation of Victor's

                  death and Justine's being cast into the Swiss prison where he visited her, the second
                  wave of dark events is starkly complementary. Now his best friend has been murdered
                  and he has himself experienced the alienating effects of imprisonment. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10905"><span class="term">I will proceed with my tale </span> With Victor's pause to utter his encomium upon Clerval and thus intrude a strong
                  value judgment into his discourse, the question of narrative truth is once again brought
                  to the fore. Once again, Victor intrudes the notion of a "tale," a word used by him
                  (I:L4:28, I:3:13) and by the Creature (II:2:13, II:2:16, II:9:18) to describe their
                  narratives, also (with a different construction of what might constitute the truth)
                  in the last sentence of the novel's Preface. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10912"><span class="term">the herd of common projectors </span> "Projector" is a term commonly used in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
                  to refer to inventors, often in a pejorative sense. Its ambivalence of connotation
                  is reflected in the double primary meaning assigned to it by the Oxford English Dictionary:
                  a. One who forms a project, who plans or designs some enterprise or undertaking; a
                  founder. 
                  <p>b. In invidious use: A schemer; one who lives by his wits; a promoter of bubble companies;
                     a speculator, a cheat. </p> Samuel Johnson is, if anything, less evenhanded in the double definition of "projector"
                  contained in his 1755 Dictionary: 1. One who forms schemes or designs. 
                  <p>2. One who forms wild impracticable schemes. </p> Perhaps the most famous literary account of projectors is that offered by Jonathan
                  Swift in Gulliver's tour through the Grand Academy of Lagado (Gulliver's Travels,
                  III.5), a think-tank populated by inventors of perfectly useless or insane conceptions
                  and contraptions. 
                  <p>Victor Frankenstein's desire to separate himself from madmen and hacks is thus easily
                     justifiable, whether we construe it in accord with his ambition or his achievement.
                     Yet, the tone of condescension in his phrasing is expressive of an arrogance and self-approbation
                     that verges on universal contempt. Its natural complement in a social dimension would
                     be a hierarchical rigidity denominated according to class, and in a psychological
                     field the prejudice we customarily comprehend under the rubric of racism. In other
                     words, there is an easy shift from this self-esteem to the denigration of the Other
                     expressed by Victor's continual demonization of his Creature. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10925"><span class="term">I had had now neglected my promise for some time </span> Since Victor and Clerval had not left London until the end of March, and as they
                  had "passed a considerable period at Oxford" and "two months in Cumberland and Westmoreland,"
                  not to mention the time spent in this lengthy journey northward, it should now be
                  early in July, which is to say, almost a year after Victor's promise to his Creature.
                  His pattern of attenuated delays throughout the novel is particularized in an earlier
                  note. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10932"><span class="term">I often endeavoured to put an end to the existence </span> The matter-of-fact tone in which Victor speaks here clothes in euphemistic objectivity,
                  and seems meant to cushion, a remarkable statement. A person who "often" over a period
                  of a few weeks attempts to commit suicide, in general terms, would be considered seriously
                  deranged. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10939"><span class="term">his queen, and son </span> The syntax is somewhat confusing. Falkland and Gower/Goring are mentioned as companions
                  to King Charles I, whose queen was Henrietta Maria (1609-69)—actually Henriette-Marie,
                  daughter of Henry IV of France and Marie de Medici, by birth and practice a Roman
                  Catholic. The son mentioned here probably would be Charles II (1630-85; restored after
                  the Commonwealth as king of Great Britain and Ireland, 1660-85); but the term could
                  as easily apply to his slightly younger brother James II (1633-1701), who became king
                  after the death of Charles II but was deposed three years later, in 1688, in what
                  became known as the Bloodless Revolution. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10946"><span class="term">a race of devils </span> At this point Victor's demonizing of his Creature extends into a primitive form of
                  racism, transforming a personal vendetta into a supposedly objective ideology that
                  stamps this Other as inherently inferior, incapable of civilization, and undeserving
                  of existence. Thus positioning himself at an extreme of self-righteous justification,
                  Victor will fall back upon this hardened, docrinaire authority for all his subsequent
                  actions concerning the Creature. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10953"><span class="term">I belonged to a race of human beings </span> It requires but a moment's pause over this bland statement of relief, particularly
                  in conjunction with Victor's fears, expressed at the beginning of the chapter, about
                  propagating a race of devils (see III:3:2 and note) to realize that its premise is
                  a blatant racism. Mary Shelley represents it without any underscoring, all the more
                  suggestive of how inherent is the thinking, how psychologically embedded the attitude.
                  </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10960"><span class="term">the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion </span> Rage has appeared such an emotional constant of this novel that the reader may be
                  surprised in reflection to realize that the emotion never occurs in Volume 1, but
                  enters the space of the fiction in the encounter of the Creature and Victor Frankenstein
                  on the Mer-de-Glace of Mont Blanc. There the figure embroiled in rage is Victor (II:2:5).
                  In the Creature's own narration something like this present unrestrained rage occurs
                  when he burns down the cottagers' house (II:8:12). Thereafter, the novel evinces a
                  smoldering fire, ready to burst into flame at any point: we witness it in the successive
                  "rage" that grips Victor (II:9:3) and the Creature (II:9:6) over the question of the
                  creation of a companion. Beginning with chapter 3 of the third volume, rage is an
                  abiding emotion of Victor Frankenstein's, concomitant with the fever that wastes his
                  body. Now that he is dead, it is as if that violent emotion were floating free of
                  his body, the sole evidence of the bond driving both these figures to their destruction.
                  It is notable that the rage inhabiting the Creature is not against Victor but himself.
                  </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10967"><span class="term">real insanity possessed me </span> It is easy to overlook the weight of this statement, but "real" should be given its
                  due meaning. Following the accounts of Victor's attempted suicide (III:4:46) and his
                  father's questioning earlier in this chapter whether his son was not actually mad,
                  (III:5:5) these symptoms, an alteration between violent rage and withdrawn lethargy,
                  point to a serious manic-depressive condition. For Elizabeth this has to be extraordinarily
                  trying: the depressed state Victor was in when he had left her, both upon undertaking
                  the excursion to Chamounix (II:1:10 and II:1:14) and in the aftermath of his encounter
                  with the Creature (III:1:1), had been serious enough, but the extremity into which
                  it has developed hardly bodes well for her future with him. Even so, Elizabeth reverts
                  to her characteristic vocation of nurse. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10974"><span class="term">it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality </span> The uncanny coincidences by which Victor comes upon the scene of Clerval's death,
                  as if enmeshed in a logic over which he has no control, reinforce his larger sense
                  that he has no independent will to exercise in his life's narrative. These coincidences
                  may likewise remind us of the crucial role played by narrative, or having a firm control
                  over interpretation of the narrative, throughout the novel. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10981"><span class="term">a thinking and reasoning animal </span> As in his initial creation Victor's impulse is to deny humanity to the being he would
                  endow with life. What most deeply plagues his mind is the fact that his creation will
                  be beyond his control. In a theological extension of this concern, the question before
                  the creator is whether the new race, particularly the female member of it, can be
                  trusted to exercise free will. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10989"><span class="term">The recollection of this injustice </span> The Creature is an acute reader of his own history, aware that amid his accumulated
                  experiences of victimization some cases were freer than others from any possible mitigation.
                  He concentrates here on the two instances (see II:7:38 and II:8:19) where his own
                  disinterested benevolence was rewarded with a violent attack on his person. For all
                  Victor's repeated threats to grapple with his Creature, it is interesting to observe
                  that after his creation he never again physically touches him. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e10996"><span class="term">I cannot forbear recording it </span> Walton, who cannot resist the impulse to continue a creation whose end he cannot
                  predict, bears an uncanny resemblance to the obsessive Victor Frankenstein racing
                  to the denouement of the Creature's birth in Ingolstadt (I:3:8). The difference, and
                  it is one maintained throughout the novel's self-reflexive mirroring of its own operations,
                  is that writing has no effect in the world until it is read. The writer's obsession
                  with the text may seem both narcissistic and solipsistic, but this antisocial dimension
                  is confined to a conceptual plane. Still, Walton's unselfconscious acquiescence in
                  the claims of what seems to him irresistable reinforces our sense that what drives
                  Victor is little different from the passions we all share as human beings. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11003"><span class="term">only regretted . . . understanding </span> 
                  <p>At this point Elizabeth Lavenza is about twenty-one years old. Two years younger,
                     Mary Shelley has spent a good part of her childhood in Scotland, has twice been to
                     France and Switzerland, and has travelled up the Rhine through Germany and Holland
                     (none of it under parental guidance or supervision). That her experiences were unusual
                     is reflected in this observation, with its glancing feminist edge. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11012"><span class="term">that I might remain alone </span> Victor's retreat from society characteristically involves shutting himself up in
                  an enclosed room, as he had done when engaged in creating the Creature in Ingolstadt.
                  Although the former desire has turned to abhorrence, his practices do not alter. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11019"><span class="term">his remembrance </span> This confirms the sense of mortality initimated by the questions of the previous
                  paragraph. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11026"><span class="term">remorse </span> Remorse is by no means an unalloyed virtue in Enlightenment usage, as Johnson's definition
                  of it makes clear. Contemporary literary usage had, indeed, suggested that this was
                  a tragic passion. Coleridge's Remorse, which was produced in 1813, represents the
                  passion as a static rankling, and Byron, who had a hand in bringing that tragedy to
                  the stage at Drury Lane, recasts its essential situation into the unavailing grief
                  of Manfred. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11033"><span class="term">even to the most repulsive among them </span> Perhaps this statement is meant to remind us that, though Victor was originally repelled
                  by the "repulsive countenance" of Krempe, the chemistry professor at the University
                  of Ingolstadt (see I:2:9), in time he came to treasure "his sound sense and real information,"
                  however much he was still aware of their being "combined . . . with a respulsive physiognomy"
                  (I:3:1). Obviously, however, what Victor can tolerate in a human constrained by the
                  normative boundaries of inherited genetic combination he is unwilling to extend to
                  his Creature, who is a being of whom, from the first, he claimed "no mortal could
                  support the horror of that countenance" (I:4:4), a being who himself, upon first seeing
                  his reflection, "started back" from his "miserable deformity" (II:4:13). Victor's
                  magnanimous identification with his fellow beings collapses here under the weight
                  of the ironies of a categorical discrimination he seems unable to comprehend. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11040"><span class="term">a resolution . . . of vice </span> This is a term with something of a history in the novel. Both Walton and Victor have
                  earlier prided themselves on their resolution. See I:L1:6 and note, confirmed in I:L2:5,
                  and I:3:1. Victor's resolution will become ever more unbending and even murderous
                  in the course of the novel's conclusion. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11047"><span class="term">I grew restless and nervous </span> As in Ingolstadt (I:3:14), Victor's health begins to suffer from his compulsive and
                  solitary existence. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11054"><span class="term">to restrain me </span> It would appear from this statement that Victor's capacity for violence has increased
                  markedly since, three months earlier, he had destroyed the female creature, "trembling
                  with passion" (III:3:4). Again, the terminology (e.g., "restrain") seems appropriate
                  to a pathological condition. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11061"><span class="term">a restless spectre </span> Literally, a ghost who cannot break through the barrier separating the afterworld
                  from the scene of actual human life. Such a being, we should remind ourselves, is
                  also a "dæmon," the term used by Victor in the previous sentence to distance himself
                  from and dehumanize his Creature. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11069"><span class="term">revenge remains . . . food </span> The Creature, as it were, accepts the challenge Victor offered at the beginning of
                  the previous paragraph, assuming mastery over his destiny. The terms in which he defines
                  his revenge, indeed, will be the dominating force of the later chapters, in which
                  vengeance becomes a single-minded obsession for both creature and creator. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11076"><span class="term">Leigh Hunt's "Rimini" </span> Leigh Hunt's Story of Rimini (1816) recounts the legendary love of Francesca da Rimini
                  and her brother-in-law, Paolo Malatesta, which is found in Dante's Inferno (5.73-138),
                  in a style at once richly textured like a medieval tapestry and linguistically contemporary.
                  His explanation for the illicit love was that the youthful Francesca was married to
                  Paolo as a stand-in for his haughty older brother and fell in love with him at first
                  sight. This quotation comes from the beginning of Canto 2, after the groom's elaborate
                  wedding party arrives with the surrogate Paolo as "the very poetry of nature" (2.47)
                  to fetch the bride. In 1815 Hunt had become something of a mentor to both Mary Godwin
                  and Percy Bysshe Shelley, and he was to remain one of their warmest friends. Indicative
                  of how close this circle was, Hunt's Story of Rimini was dedicated to Lord Byron.

               <li class="item" id="d30e11083"><span class="term">roarings like thunder </span> This is the sound of the "ground sea," which had also been heard some five weeks
                  earlier, on the afternoon of 31 July (I:L4:5 and note). The breakup of the ice on
                  that occasion cut Victor Frankenstein off from his Creature, and he remembered its
                  violent sound (III:7:24 and note) in terms similar to those used here by Walton. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11090"><span class="term">Rotterdam </span> In 1814 the Shelley party also sailed for England from the port of Rotterdam. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11097"><span class="term">I could not sacrifice the whole human race </span> Even as Victor demonized his Creature and surrounded his second creation with imaginings
                  of the direst consequences, it is clear that in the ensuing months he has inflated
                  this act of destruction of the second being, transforming what appeared at the time
                  as an act of passionate homicide into a gesture of sublime heroism offered in behalf
                  of all of humankind. It is small wonder Alphone Frankenstein changes the subject:
                  such apparent delusions of grandeur are highly suspect. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11104"><span class="term">Mont Salêve </span> This is a nice touch on Mary Shelley's part. The attentive reader will nod in recognition
                  that the previous time this mountain was reported as being in Victor's line of vision,
                  two years earlier, he had descried his Creature climbing its nearly perpendicular
                  face (I:6:22). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11111"><span class="term">the same boat </span> A realistic perspective on this evidence might emphasize the fact that, since both
                  the Creature's and Victor's boats are Scottish in make, they would therefore in all
                  probability resemble one another closely. But Mary Shelley seems to have another purpose
                  in mind. Having already forced an aura of the uncanny upon this scene through the
                  great distance of travel and coincidence of destination of her characters, she subtly
                  reinforces the interchangeability of Creature and creator that will progressively
                  intensify as the novel moves towards its conclusion. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11118"><span class="term">what a scene has just taken place </span> Characteristic of the structural ingenuity of Frankenstein, its final scene is a
                  recollected flashback. Chronologically speaking, this brief paragraph, with its self-reflexiveness
                  about its own artistic imperatives and capacities, constitutes something of a final
                  bow, the last words of a novel that, from end to end, has held a mirror up to its
                  own operations as a primary example of the creation that is its theme. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11125"><span class="term">scent of flowers and hay </span> As this is June, the air is suffused with the scent of Alpine wildflowers and freshly
                  cut grass: this would appear a memory of Mary Shelley's from the 1816 summer. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11132"><span class="term">my selfish despair </span> If the terms in which Victor recounts his regaining a sense of responsibility cannot
                  easily be reconciled with a disinterested ethics, one senses in this phrase a tone
                  of self-accusation reflecting a more mature understanding of his own implication in
                  the catastrophic events he has unleashed. This acceptance of responsibility is not
                  uniform, returning only sporadically in the later chapters of the novel, but it testifies,
                  perhaps, to a measure of moral growth; or, if Victor's vindictive diction places that
                  conclusion in some doubt, at least to a sharper sense of the price that has been paid
                  for his solitary ambition and withdrawal from normative human interactions. Still,
                  suspecting that Victor's self-important posture as family protector will only eventuate
                  in great calamities, a reader may find it hard not to cast an ironic eye upon what
                  continue as usual to be good intentions never sufficiently thought through. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11139"><span class="term">the lessons of my Seneca </span> 
                  <p>Lucius Annaeus Seneca (c. 4 BCE — 65 CE). A leading philosopher and statesman of the
                     mid-first century, Seneca was also a playwright, whose nine tragedies celebrate stoic
                     resignation. As a statesman, his practice was anything but what such a philosophical
                     stance might indicate, for he was an activist not a conservative. He was Nero's tutor
                     and later acted behind the scenes to secure the emperor's power. He retired from the
                     court in the year 62 to devote himself to philosophy, but three years later he was
                     denounced as taking part in the conspiracy of Piso against the emperor. Ordered by
                     Nero to commit suicide, Seneca took his own life with stoic resignation and fortitude.
                     It is not, it would appear, in Seneca's writings but in his example that Walton looks
                     for comfort in his peril.</p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11149"><span class="term">sensibility </span> Victor is here being characterized as the ideal "man of feeling," in accord with
                  Enlightenment cultural standards of a kind associated with the writings of Rousseau
                  and, in English, Adam Smith. With the latter, see particularly The Theory of Moral
                  Sentiments, 3.2-3.3, 5.2, and 6.3. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11156"><span class="term">sentence </span> Officially exonerated as he has been by his trial in the previous chapter, Victor
                  nonetheless carries a profound psychological sense that he has been convicted in the
                  court in which his destiny has been plotted and that there is no escaping the sentence.
                  That he totally misreads the result, however, is sufficient commentary on the "necessity"
                  under which he feels he labors. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11163"><span class="term">September 2d </span> A week has elapsed since Walton's last entry in the letter to his sister, a notable
                  absence in a time frame that has been previously so overcharged with event. The dating
                  makes comparison almost inevitable, and the reader thus becomes conscious of the curious
                  fact that the entirety of Victor's narration of his life took one day less than this
                  week-long lacuna in which the late-summer ice has slowly but inexorably been heaved
                  by the pressures of wind and sea into threatening mountains. The natural landscape,
                  as is so often the case with Mary Shelley's treatment of the sublime Arctic wilderness,
                  has a corollary in the psychological development of her characters, particularly in
                  the nexus of guilt and destiny driving Victor. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11170"><span class="term">September 9th </span> 
                  <p>In 1818 the compositor, evidently reading this as one in a series of journal entries,
                     surmised that it could not follow "September 12th" and added an integer to make it
                     "September 19th." But, of course, what the text intends us to understand by its idiom
                     is, "On September 9th the ice began to move." Since this is the date in the manuscript
                     and it is restored in 1831, the text has been emended here. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11179"><span class="term">the latter days of </span> The text printed in 1818 has "latter days of December," which is clearly a compositor's
                  error unnoticed in the Shelleys' proofreading of the text for the first edition. The
                  mistake, once in print, went unnoticed in all later editions of the novel. In Mary
                  Shelley's draft, however, the word is unmistakably "September." She would have had
                  every reason to adhere to this timeline since, just a few weeks earlier than her fictional
                  schedule, in 1814, it took the Shelley party nine days to cover the distance between
                  Basel and Rotterdam (30 August-7 September) travelling exactly as do Victor Frankenstein
                  and Henry Clerval and, even when adverse conditions delayed their departure from Holland,
                  a three days' crossing brought them to London on 13 September (see Six Weeks' Tour
                  for Switzerland and Holland). 
                  <p>The attenuated journey of the 1818 text is whittled to three months in the shifting
                     of the original departure date in 1831, which, as indicated earlier, may have been
                     done to accommodate the timespan after Victor's return from Mont Blanc rather than
                     his arrival date in England. In the next chapter, as recorded in both the 1818 and
                     1831 texts, the chronology reverts to a normative calendar and Victor observes that
                     he and Clerval "had arrived in England at the beginning of October" (III:2:5). </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11188"><span class="term">the shadow of a human being </span> Although this phrase is meant to underscore the precarious state of Victor's physical
                  health, it resonates within a psychological and moral construction as well, once again
                  reminding us of how like the state of his Creature Victor's has become. The Creature
                  functions as a shadow, not just in the modern sense of trailing Victor wherever he
                  goes, but also in his incapacity ever to assume a full human dimension. Victor, in
                  his isolation and his chronic sense of undiscriminating guilt, has also forsaken that
                  dimension. In the late chapters of the novel Victor's physical condition is, as here,
                  a measure of his psychic state. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11195"><span class="term">a shout of tumultuous joy </span> Although there are shrieks of fear or anger here and there across this novel's landscape,
                  this is the only shout heard in Frankenstein. The intense silence of the novel, indeed,
                  is a remarkable stylistic achievement. The noisy enthuasiasm of the sailors may remind
                  us of Victor's recent recollection of how the Greek soldiers wept for joy upon reencountering
                  the sea when they returned from Persia (III:7:17). The naturalness of the mariners'
                  response stands in paradoxical contrast with Victor's sense of transcendental empowerment.
                  It is little wonder that he should be awakened from his sleep by the threat simple
                  humanity poses against his aims. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11202"><span class="term">I shut my eyes involuntarily </span> These two sentences encapsulate a highly complex aesthetic and moral act. It is against
                  his will that Walton closes his eyes; yet with eyes closed he occupies an essentially
                  different space from that in which he first viewed the Creature a second before. He
                  has unwittingly placed himself in the position of the elder DeLacey, who is the only
                  stranger not to have rejected the Creature at first sight (II:7:18). DeLacey's blindness
                  and Walton's closed eyes remove from their judgments the beautiful as a determining
                  aesthetic criterion. With its absence each is able to act on what purports to be an
                  objective moral plane, or at least not to have pre-determined aesthetic categories
                  prejudice their responses. Paradoxically, an act that is reflexive and therefore deterministic
                  in its inception becomes the means by which unexamined, normative standards of behavior,
                  which are truly deterministic in their impulse, can be transcended, allowing an exercise
                  of free will. Since Walton is not actually blind, his act in its ethical import is
                  unique for the novel. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11209"><span class="term">with a single man in it </span> The villagers one and all reduce the being whom Victor has been anathematizing as
                  a daemon to human proportions. In this they seem cast in the same mold as Walton's
                  lieutenant who, after the initial appearance of the Creature, stolidly questions Victor
                  about the "man" he has been pursuing (I:L4:11). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11216"><span class="term">a sister or a brother </span> In terms of Mary Shelley's biography, this may be a revealing, if somewhat odd, statement.
                  Mary Shelley was the sole child of William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft, conceived
                  before they were officially married and then left motherless by Wollstonecraft's death.
                  She had three step-siblings: Fanny Imlay, the daughter of Mary Wollstonecraft and
                  the American Gilbert Imlay, who committed suicide in 1817 while Mary was still engaged
                  in the writing of Frankenstein; and Charles and Claire Clairmont, children of the
                  first marriage of Godwin's second wife Mary Jane Clairmont. Because of their gender
                  and nearness of age, Mary and Claire were thrown much together and experienced considerable
                  sibling friction. Claire's unacknowledged pregnancy by Lord Byron was the driving
                  force behind the 1816 journey to Geneva, and when her condition became known it fell
                  largely to Mary to see her through the pregnancy without scandal. From this point
                  on, for the next five years, Claire lived with the Shelleys both in England and Italy.
                  Whatever words Victor speaks here, it is clear that Mary's closeness to her step-sister
                  generally increased the suspiciousness with which she regarded Claire's motives and
                  actions. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11223"><span class="term">I was the slave, not the master </span> The Creature reverts to the terms of his last confrontation of Victor Frankenstein,
                  when he called Victor his slave and demanded his obedience (III:3:11 and note). The
                  effect of this recantation, however, is not so much the simple reversal the diction
                  connotes, as an erasure of the polarizing of his terms. Both he and Victor were slaves,
                  mastered alike by their antagonism. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11231"><span class="term">during which I was the slave of my creature </span> 
                  <p>The new terminology for Victor's relationship with the Creature, introduced four paragraphs
                     earlier (III:1:9), returns with augmented stress. The underlying notion of slavery
                     includes not just bondage but an absence of willed responsibility. Victor thus appears
                     to be distancing himself from his recognition of the awesome obligations of a deity
                     with which the second volume closed (II:9:18). </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11240"><span class="term">my slavery </span> 
                  <p>This term is ominous for Victor's future relations with his Creature. It also considerably
                     darkens the construction of what Victor sees as his destiny, also of how he comprehends
                     the nature of imitative behavior, for he appears to think it achieved not through
                     emulation but, rather, through the exercise of coercion.</p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11249"><span class="term">smooth and placid as a southern sea </span> Victor's only experience of a southern sea would appear to have come at the beginning
                  of this last trip in pursuit of the Creature, embarked on from a French Mediterranean
                  port (III:7:9). On its surface his sardonic comment roundly indicts the crew for moral
                  and spiritual laxity. Yet, on second thought, an even stronger counterforce ironically
                  deflates the surface terms. This ironic inversion begins as we recognize the considerable
                  negative connotations from earlier in the novel already adhering to this celebration
                  of the "glorious" (I:L1:6 and note, I:L2:3 and note, and III:Walton:6 and note). On
                  top of those resonances, the reference to "a southern sea" should remind the knowledgeable
                  reader of the last voyage undertaken by Ulysses and his crew in search of glory, a
                  voyage that took them far into the unknown southern sea where their ship foundered.
                  This is the subject of Canto 26 of Dante's Inferno, which is likewise the source upon
                  which Tennyson depended for his dramatic monologue, "Ulysses," written in 1833. In
                  Dante's rendition of this story, for all his heroic posturing, Ulysses has led his
                  men to their death for nothing beyond a meaningless personal glory. For this act of
                  essential treachery he is lodged near the bottom of hell for eternity. 
                  <p>It is worth remarking that, in her draft of this passage, Mary Shelley originally
                     wrote "summer lake," and the phrase "southern sea" was inserted above it in P. B.
                     Shelley's hand. This interpolation, of course, would have had to have been agreed
                     to by Mary Shelley, presumably after some discussion of the appropriateness of the
                     intertextual context the phrase evokes. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11258"><span class="term">smothered voice </span> A year after the Creature's long narration beneath Mont Blanc and after several chapters
                  devoted to Victor's egocentric ruminations in the interim, we are here sharply reminded
                  of the Creature's inner life that Victor refuses to acknowledge. In modern parlance
                  the Creature is engaged at this point in a deliberate repression of his anger. As
                  in their previous encounter Victor notably outrants his Creature. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11265"><span class="term">the solitude I coveted </span> 
                  <p>Although, of course, Victor will need to pursue his scientific labors by himself,
                     the verb "coveted" conveys a sense of profound asociality as a crucial aspect of Victor's
                     constitution. However eagerly he expresses his anticipation of returning to find fulfillment
                     in his union with Elizabeth, what his father praises as "our domestic calm" at this
                     point in the 1818 edition seems wholly to lack the capacity to satisfy Victor.</p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11274"><span class="term">some destiny </span> Victor's perhaps unconscious withdrawal into vague euphemism to match his father's
                  rhetoric here strongly suggests a lack of candor. It also indicates that, however
                  self-accusing he may be, he has accepted no real responsibility for the actions of
                  his Creature. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11281"><span class="term">wishing for some mighty revolution </span> Victor's desire for an externally applied apocalyptic solution that will break the
                  logical circle he cannot escape is as characteristic of him as the passivity into
                  which he actually retreats from the stress of events. Still, his figure resonates
                  against his contrasting application of the turning wheel a few paragraphs earlier
                  (see III:4:12 and note), where its every revolution was conceived as bringing new
                  calamities upon him. 
                  <p>The term "mighty revolution" cannot but retain some of its political charge in the
                     context of post-Napoleonic Europe, particularly if connected to the world of undiscriminated
                     wretchedness that Victor had been contemplating before Mr. Kirwin entered to prepare
                     him for his father's arrival (III:4:21). </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11290"><span class="term">soon lost amid the waves </span> The Creature disappears not only with the same superhuman speed but also in much
                  the same language as accompanied his previous departure from Victor's ken, on the
                  Mer de Glace below Mont Blanc (see II:9:18). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11297"><span class="term">so unfeeling a speech </span> Victor's reflection on the nurse's lack of charity and sympathy is surely justified,
                  but it has a double edge, reminding the reader of a similar abstracted indifference
                  with which he has treated a being with far more substantial claims on his interest
                  and attention. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11304"><span class="term">the spirits of the dead </span> The character of the "guiding spirit" (III:7:17) is darkened even more by this representation
                  of the walking dead hovering around Victor and encouraging his desperate venture into
                  a world of death. Although such macaberie is conventional to the gothic mode, its
                  psychological impress here is new and startling. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11311"><span class="term">a spirit of good </span> The context strongly suggests that it is the ever-watchful Creature who is sustaining
                  Victor's life throughout his long voyage, not the heaven-directed spirits that Victor
                  imagines. Thus, this phrase is heavily weighted with irony. The irony is in fact attenuated,
                  for Mary Shelley could not have written this phrase without consciousness of P.B.
                  Shelley's title, "Alastor, or the Spirit of Solitude," the poem he published in 1816,
                  three months before the excursion to Lake Geneva. An alastor in Greek is an evil spirit.
                  </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11319"><span class="term">The spirits that guarded me </span> Two paragraphs before Victor hypothesized the active intervention of the spirit world
                  on his behalf. By this point he has convinced himself that he is under their protection.
                  This is a further example of how in the last pages of his narration Victor moves further
                  and further beyond the boundaries of a normative rationality. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11326"><span class="term">the spirits that I had invoked to aid me </span> This observation strengthens Victor's faith in an unworldly sanction for his mission
                  of destruction. Yet, the forceful egotism by which Victor empowers himself, justifying
                  his actions as divinely decreed, also suggests what today we would call a megalomania.
                  </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11333"><span class="term">this glorious spirit </span> This is the second time that Walton has referred to Victor Frankenstein as "glorious."
                  Although less obviously allusive to Milton's characterization of Satan in Paradise
                  Lost than the earlier reference (III:Walton:6 and note; see also I:L4:22), the verbal
                  repetition serves to underscore with some finality the parallel with the fallen archangel.
                  </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11340"><span class="term">The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around </span> As the chapter continues the tentative "seems" of the shadow cast by the dead is
                  sharpened by Victor into a certainty. The dead become the enablers of his action and
                  he sees himself increasingly as acting upon their behalf. Again, Mary Shelley's psychological
                  portrait here is subtly telling: a person who has given up all sense of individual
                  will has surrendered the central principal of vitality and may, indeed, be considered
                  to have become an agent of death. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11347"><span class="term">as I spoke my native language </span> Although he has spent a full year negotiating his way in English, when Victor is
                  reduced to an irrational state he naturally falls back on his native French. There
                  is an undercurrent of class revealed in the indication that only Mr. Kirwin among
                  the Irish attendants or villagers is sufficiently educated to understand French. </li>

                  <p>A coastal city in Fife, St. Andrew's is the site of the oldest university in Scotland,
                     founded in 1411. However impatient Victor represents himself, he and Henry Clerval

                  <p>Coming up the Thames, these late eighteenth-century travellers remark the objects
                     that rise above the cityscape, which in general would have otherwise been limited
                     to perhaps five or six storeys in height. In these circumstances the steeples of the
                     London churches would have called attention to themselves, as they include many architectural
                     masterpieces. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11372"><span class="term">Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended </span> Mary Shelley's readers might easily construe the storm as merely providing a conventional
                  Gothic atmosphere in which to wrap the suspense of this long-awaited evening. But
                  the storm functions more specifically as a leitmotif associated with the sublime power
                  of nature, of forces beyond human control, and of the Creature. There actually are
                  only two such Gothic storms in Frankenstein. The first was also set in the environs
                  of Lake Geneva and occured as Victor, returning from Ingolstadt, sought out the scene
                  of his brother William's death at Plainpalais. There in a brilliant flash of lightning
                  he encountered the form of his Creature for the first time since the night of its
                  creation. That scene in the sixth chapter in the first volume (I:6:20) thus operates
                  as a symmetrical counterpart to this other storm of the sixth chapter of the third
                  volume, anticipating the reemergence of the Creature into Victor's domestic idyll.
                  </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11379"><span class="term">The story is too connected </span> Doubtless, Victor, who has in numerous critical situations been unwilling to explain
                  his case for fear of not being believed, worries about how he can convey his deposition
                  so as to produce conviction. Yet, once again, the language reminds us that we are
                  in the midst of a narrative whose truth is totally dependant on the veracity of the
                  narrator. Victor likewise makes much of its internal consistency to Walton as he begins
                  the narration (I:L4:30). What this detail adds is the realization that Victor's is
                  truly what Nathaniel Hawthorne termed a "twice-told tale," having, with the exception
                  of its final chapter, been already rehearsed in the judge's chamber. The reiteration
                  of such a tale of fatally transgressed boundaries recalls the context provided by
                  the same sort of obsessive repetition in Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner."

               <li class="item" id="d30e11386"><span class="term">St. Paul's </span> 
                  <p>In the eighteenth century the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral, after St. Peter's in Rome
                     the largest structure in the world, dominated the London cityscape. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11395"><span class="term">Strasburgh </span> 
                  <p>The idea here is that Victor would travel northeast to Basel on the confines of Switzerland,
                     thence follow the Rhine to Strasbourg, where he would be met by Clerval who, suspending
                     his course of studies at the University of Ingolstadt, would have travelled west across
                     Germany to join him. The two would then proceed north by boat through Germany into
                     Holland where the Rhine empties into the North Sea just beyond Rotterdam. This is
                     essentially the return route followed by Mary Godwin and Percy Shelley in their 1814
                     excursion memorialized in A History of a Six Weeks' Tour.</p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11405"><span class="term">the strange chances that have lately occured </span> Mary Shelley's diction indicates how deliberately she has plotted these "strange
                  chances" to seem beyond the ordinary expectations of causality, whether in a human
                  or a novelistic sphere. Such uncanny events are, however, a customary feature of the
                  gothic novel, and it is at points like this that one feels that the author fully recognizes
                  the heritage she is exploiting. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11412"><span class="term">A deadly struggle would take place </span> Although Victor is self-evidently no match in strength with his creature, he continually
                  looks to a melodramatic struggle-to-the-death to resolve their conflict, thus substituting
                  a simply physical resolution for one that might embody ethical or psychological justice.
                  Once again, one may read here a female author's sense of the conventions of masculinist
                  fictions, whether those of art or real life. (For other instances where Victor similarly
                  falls back on physical competitiveness, see II:2:5, II:2:6, III:3:16 and III:3:17).

               <li class="item" id="d30e11419"><span class="term">I generally subsisted on the wild animals </span> In the vegetarian Shelley household this information would carry an implicit ring
                  of false consciousness, as Victor charges himself with a solemn revenge for murders
                  of human beings yet supports his mission by killing other sentient creatures. Readers
                  will recall that, in contrast, the Creature is a strict vegetarian. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11426"><span class="term">yet another may succeed </span> Victor's complete self-contradiction in his last moments mirrors the novel's ambivalence
                  over the conflicting claims of domestic retreat and aspiring self-assertion, which
                  are in turn poles that themselves comprise a dialectical field over which Romanticism
                  continually expresses much ambivalence. The particular terms of Victor's last utterance
                  have a somewhat chilling effect: at what, a reader may well wonder, does Victor contemplate
                  another's success? If in the realm in which he has failed, assuming the role of God,
                  we may envision from Victor's experience a greater, even a catastrophic, failure.
                  Even as he moves linguistically to open up possibility, the lingering effects of his
                  example resist his optimism. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11433"><span class="term">suffering blunt </span> The reader who has overheard the Creature's narrative—particularly his claim that
                  "misery made me a fiend" (see II:2:11 and note)—may view this generalized platitude
                  with a more sharply focussed perspective than Victor brings to bear on it. As is so
                  often the case, he misses the connnection between his experiences and those of the
                  being he created. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11440"><span class="term">sufficent for me was the consciousness of them </span> In other words, what human society allows into its purview is no longer the factor
                  by which Victor judges his actions. His sense of pronounced guilt in the face of a
                  normative cultural sanction of his innocence moves him further into an alienated posture
                  that seems identical with what we have come, in the second volume of the novel, to
                  characterize as that of the Creature. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11447"><span class="term">a sum of money, together with a few jewels </span> Does Mary Shelley intend us to see a comparison or a total contrast with Safie, who
                  uses virtually the same words to explain how she escaped her father in Leghorn and
                  made it north to the De Lacey's cottage in Germany? That episode, impelled by love,
                  occurs at the center and southern extremity of the novel; Victor, in this last chapter
                  of his narrative, stands near its outer edge and sets out for the far north driven
                  by a hatred that in its passion and compulsion seems a mirror reflection of Safie's
                  desire: see II:6:19. 
                  <p>The statement also contains a second bearing, which is that, although it is not explicitly
                     mentioned by Victor, with the demise of Alphonse Frankenstein, Victor, as first-born
                     son, has inherited the family estate and can spend his inheritance in whatever fashion
                     he chooses. No longer need he follow his father's admonition to attend a university
                     (see I:2:1) or ask his permission to travel to the British Isles (see III:1:11). In
                     effect, Victor is now the patriarch of his family. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11456"><span class="term">the sun shone upon me </span> The context seems to take the reader back to the May afternoon two and a half years
                  earlier when Victor and Henry Clerval returned from their happy perambulations in
                  the region of Ingolstadt to find Alphonse Frankenstein's letter describing William's
                  death. Such innocent pleasure in natural renewal, Victor asserts, is no longer possible
                  for him (see I:5:17). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11463"><span class="term">swear </span> That Victor has no right to implicate Walton in his vendetta goes without saying.
                  But the legalistic, contractual mode in which he assaults Walton testifies strongly
                  to the closed tyranny of mind in which he has been laboring now for many months. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11470"><span class="term">sympathies </span> Although Victor dehumanizes the creature, it is interesting to recognize that, even
                  so, he is unable to deny the being's fundamental claim to a primary human attribute.

               <li class="item" id="d30e11477"><span class="term">the sympathy of a stranger </span> In accentuating his own lack of any ties but the common ones of humanity, Mr. Kirwin
                  quietly establishes his link with Walton, who in the immediate context of the narrative
                  recital has likewise altruistically attended to Victor's well-being without any sense
                  of obligation or self-congratulation. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11485"><span class="term">tears gushed from my eyes </span> Victor's emotional instability is underscored by this sudden excess of sensibility.
                  That his rekindled joy will soon be transformed into the despair his isolation in
                  the boat had prefigured is indicative of the irony in which, from the point in which
                  he spurned his Creature's desire for sympathetic rapport, he finds himself invested.
                  Later, hope will come to him in a "burning gush" of ironically inverted expectation
                  (III:7:22). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11492"><span class="term">tears . . . streamed from my eyes </span> Even as Victor thinks of himself as reacting with compassion to the assumed plight
                  of Elizabeth, it is clear to any reader that he is actually weeping for himself. His
                  giving in at last to his feelings is thus ironized, for rather than opening him to
                  a renewal of his emotional life, his convulsive weeping results from a maudlin theatrical
                  representation of his own death that wholly mistakes the threat to his future wife.

               <li class="item" id="d30e11524"><span class="term">the devil </span> Curiously, with so many references to the Creature as diabolical, only once earlier
                  has Victor used this flat substantive, when he glimpsed the Creature on the Plainpalais
                  outside Geneva after uttering a similar imprecation to the heavens. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11531"><span class="term">Are you then safe </span> Victor's first words to his father in fourteen months must, if we detach ourselves
                  from his obsessive perspective, seem more than merely odd. They are the expression
                  of what has become a deeply paranoid personality. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11538"><span class="term">the Tower </span> 
                  <p>By the eighteenth century the Tower of London had been reduced to a tourist attraction,
                     housing the crown jewels, the royal armor modelled by full-size wooden figures, and
                     a menagerie dominated by the great cats.</p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11547"><span class="term">She was thinner </span> Characteristically, Victor construes Elizabeth's state of health in reference to
                  himself. At the age of twenty-two she should not be so beyond her prime. Clearly,
                  worry over the last two years has taken its toll. Although Mary Shelley maintains
                  her undeviating focus on Victor, this momentary description illuminates the cost of
                  his obsession and detachment from Elizabeth on her state of mind and body. This is
                  as close to an inner life as Elizabeth ever manifests. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11554"><span class="term">this deposition did not in the least interest me </span> A reader could sense a cultural dislocation and estrangement behind this remark.
                  On the other hand, the lack of concern for the plight of others unless it bears in
                  some way on his own subtly underscores Victor's egotism here. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11561"><span class="term">thrust your sword </span> From the language of the legalistic contract, expressing at least an implicit ideal
                  of fidelity, Victor advances to that of the secret assassin. Here in the last sentence
                  of his narration, we are confronted with the mentality of a murderer. In that regard,
                  at the very least, the doubling with his creature is absolute. </li>

               <li class="item" id="d30e11576"><span class="term">Tintern Abbey </span> Mary Shelley quotes lines 76-83 of the last poem in the 1798 Lyrical Ballads by Wordsworth
                  and Coleridge, changing first person pronouns to the third person ("or" in line 83
                  was regularized by Wordsworth to "nor" only in 1836). The quotation of these celebrated
                  lines about natural inspiration underscores the association of Henry Clerval with
                  the Romantic poet, and more specifically, might recall Byron's remark that Percy Shelley
                  "dosed" him with Wordsworth during the summer of 1816. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11583"><span class="term">which are to cease but with life </span> Another conspicuous feature of the final chapter is introduced here. Although we
                  are close to having completed the narrative circle, returning to Walton's voice part
                  way through this chapter, the continual shift of time frames does more than remind
                  us of this impending closure. The sudden confrontation of past and future in a sentence
                  such as this also serves implicitly to suggest that at the point where Victor locked
                  himself into the hermetically sealed enclosure of his obsession, time began to lose
                  its normative distinctions. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11590"><span class="term">You throw a torch </span> Walton's metaphor is prescient, since it is by fire that the Creature plans to consume
                  himself (III:Walton:45). It is no coincidence but an extensive of the metaphor that
                  Victor appears to have succumbed to a consumptive fever (III:Walton:14). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11597"><span class="term">tore to pieces the thing </span> On the complex moral spectrum laid out by this novel Victor here engages in the equivalent
                  of murder. His destructive burst of passion and pointed denial of humanity to the
                  object of his creation, which he calls a thing, reduce him at least to the moral level
                  of the Creature, who at this point has likewise been guilty of one murder. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11604"><span class="term">it did not endure the violence of the change without torture </span> Having been created over a long period of time, then brought to life, the Creature
                  has passed the nearly six years of his existence being recreated in an inverse, indeed,
                  a negative manner. He describes it as viscerallly painful, a creation without anesthesia.
                  The violent negation of his original being is a corollary to the way in which hatred
                  replaced love as his bond with Victor Frankenstein. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11611"><span class="term">the tour of Scotland alone </span> Obviously, Victor needs to isolate himself in order to carry out his scientific labors.
                  On the other hand, the phraseology here may be seen as indicative of an antisocial
                  instinct that has been so long indulged as to have become an essential aspect of his
                  character. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11618"><span class="term">To you first entering on life </span> In regard to this curious reminder of the present tense in which Victor narrates
                  the story of his life, it is important to recall that, far from being Victor's junior,
                  Walton is 28 years old at this point in the account, one year older than Victor. A
                  useful point of comparison is the exchange between the simple Chamois Hunter and Manfred
                  in the second act of Byron's Manfred, the dramatic poem he began in the summer of
                  1816 and set in the same Alpine wilderness as the second volume of Mary Shelley's

                  <p>Asked to reply candidly, Victor lies to his father. This might be considered of a
                     piece with the way he recalled his solemn promise to the Creature two paragraphs earlier:
                     no sooner was it invoked than he began immediately to consider what would result should
                     he dare to break it.</p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11651"><span class="term">I tried to conceal </span> Although Clerval has just been described as like a "former self" to Victor, the difference
                  between them involves more than the effect of experience on each man's sense of well-being.
                  Victor is, in effect, living a lie, and his lack of openness to Clerval is the actual
                  wedge by which their division is being enforced. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11658"><span class="term">like the turning of the wheel </span> When Ixion, king of Thessaly, fell in love with Hera, Zeus punished him for his effrontery
                  by binding him to a wheel in Hades that revolved in perpetuity. In notable instances
                  in the English literary tradition the mode of Ixion's torture is reconceptualized
                  in psychological terms. Mary Shelley would surely have been familiar with King Lear's
                  portrayal of himself as "bound/ Upon a wheel of fire" (IV.vii.46-47). It could well
                  be that her own image influenced Percy Shelley's employment of the same figure in
                  Prometheus Unbound (see I.139-42). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11665"><span class="term">I lay for two months </span> It has been less than three years since Victor Frankenstein had been seized with
                  a similar "nervous fever" that, after the creation of his being, confined him for
                  months (see I:4:17 and note). Mary Shelley emphasizes how severely debilitated his
                  physical state has become as a result of the acute psychological stress under which
                  he has been laboring and from which no amount of diversion can seem to liberate him.
                  </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11672"><span class="term">the threatened fate as unavoidable </span> Victor's constant attention to his unavoidable fate is at least partly to be construed,
                  at this point in the discourse, as a justification for the blindness with which he
                  worried so exclusively about himself, leaving Elizabeth unprotected. But it falls
                  in line as well with his reiterated invocation of destiny during this narration to
                  Walton, a rhetorical ploy by which, whether or not it is his explicit intention, he
                  exonerates himself of acknowledged responsiblity for the events his actions produce.
                  </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11679"><span class="term">unmingled with disbelief </span> Victor's self-consciousness as to his effect as narrator shadows this deposition
                  of his case, both for the magistrate and for Mary Shelley's readers. We cannot help
                  recognizing here that the end of a novel is to make fiction appear like truth. That
                  Victor in the end does not gain the credence of his judge does, of course, vindicate
                  his earlier reticence; but it also in some sense impinges on his reliability as a
                  witness. Does it also have a destabilizing effect on the larger narrative of which
                  it is a microcosm? </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11686"><span class="term">utter carelessness . . . second </span> Again, as in his shock over the mistreatment of Justine Moritz in the first volume
                  (I:7:30), Victor's innate sense of decency is evoked to complicate our recognitions:
                  in this particular case, that his own medical carelessness was implicit in his creation
                  of a being with monstrous features who could not function within a conventional social
                  format (I:3:7) and that his uncaring brutality has been recently marked in the wanton
                  destruction of the second creature on whom he had been working in the preceding chapter
                  (III:3:4). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11693"><span class="term">one vast hand was extended </span> With his "hand . . . stretched out, seemingly to detain" his double, the Creature
                  replicates the gesture in which he first appeared before Victor's eyes, in his bedroom
                  in Ingolstadt (I:4:3). The reaction of Walton to his monstrous presence is in stark
                  contrast to that evinced on that previous occasion by his creator. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11700"><span class="term">We travelled at the time of the vintage </span> In this context "vintage" means the harvesting of the grapes used in making the classic
                  white wines of Germany frequently designated as "Rhine wines." Mary Godwin, Claire
                  Clairmont, and Percy Bysshe Shelley descended the Rhine at this same time of year
                  in 1814, and this description is colored by the experiences Mary recorded in A History
                  of a Six Weeks' Tour. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11707"><span class="term">the love of virtue </span> The Creature unwittingly echoes the language with which Victor surveyed his past
                  life after the execution of Justine Moritz (II:1:1). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11714"><span class="term">voluntary thought </span> Beginning with this phrase, the last chapter of Victor's long narration starts a
                  subtle recapitulation and intensification of the overarching themes of his discourse.
                  In this case, if we read between the lines we realize that Victor has finally given
                  up all reponsibility for his own actions and, with that loss, any sense of his individual
                  identity. He is now locking himself within the dyad of his adversarial relation with
                  the Creature. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11721"><span class="term">I was alone </span> Victor ironically echoes the reflection of the Creature, as he contemplates the domestic
                  happiness of the De Lacey household, on his contrasting solitude. The diction the
                  Creature used at the point—"no Eve soothed my sorrows"—would suggest that it was then
                  that he began to conceive the plan for a mate that here comes to a disastrous conclusion.
                  (See II:7:11). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11729"><span class="term">the watery, clouded eyes </span> See I:4:2. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11736"><span class="term">Wearing away his time fruitlessly </span> The 1818 text at this point stipulates that "nearly a year had elapsed" since this
                  journey had begun from Geneva, a period the 1831 text identifies as "the latter end
                  of September." (There is a month's disparity between the two texts on this point—see
                  III:1 in 1818 and 1831). In her revision of the novel Mary Shelley, desiring to underpin
                  the professional engagement of Henry Clerval, quietly presses home the irony that
                  he, who once indolently indulged himself in imitating eastern poetry (see I:6:14)
                  now has, in contrast to Victor, a firm sense of personal mission and a commitment
                  to the future. Of course, in Ingolstadt at one point Victor was himself posssessed
                  of both traits. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11743"><span class="term">I should have wept to die </span> It is true that the Creature's first experience of spring was joyful (II:4:19); but
                  his memory is here playing tricks with him. He was created on a "dreary night of November"
                  (I:4:1), and upon his escape into the woods near Ingolstadt he experienced extreme
                  and uncomfortable cold. His reaction to his first day of life was, in fact, to weep
                  (II:3:2). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11750"><span class="term">What his feelings were </span> Mary Shelley at once reminds us that the Creature has feelings and that, except on
                  the one occasion on Mont Blanc when he told his life story (II:3:1), they are wholly
                  indecipherable to Victor, beset as he is with his calculations of revenge. She also
                  prepares us for his unmediated reintroduction into the arena of the novel when in
                  its last scene he comes aboard Walton's ship (III:Walton:33). </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11757"><span class="term">Who feared that if I lost all trace I should despair and die </span> The egotism of this statement is less strange than its underlying logic, which is
                  that the closed circle of revenge enacts a kind of perverse sympathy in which the
                  Creature sustains Victor so that he may continue on his mission to destroy his Creature.
                  Throughout this final chapter of Victor's narration Mary Shelley is ingenious in following
                  through on the implications of a life cast wholly in an ironic mode. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11764"><span class="term">wild and enthusiastic imagination </span> This encomium to Henry Clerval touches virtually all the thematic stops invoked by
                  the novel in its representation of an ideal character, with terms already enveloped
                  with multiple associations. Although any single one in excess might reveal a flaw
                  productive of personal and social difficulties, in Clerval they reside in a perfect
                  dynamic and dialectical balance. Where earlier critics associate Clerval with Percy
                  Bysshe Shelley, this passage would be taken as a loving tribute to him. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11771"><span class="term">the wind was unfavorable </span> As would be natural in this environment, the storm descends from the west or northwest,
                  picking up energy and precipitation in traversing Lake Geneva. To return to Geneva,
                  Victor must drive squarely against the wind. With sails thus rendered useless, only
                  manual exertion can prevail against the storm. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11778"><span class="term">Windsor</span> 
                  <p>Percy Shelley had been living in Windsor when he first met Mary, and it was to that
                     region that they moved in 1817 to set up their household in Marlow. There Mary Shelley
                     wrote the principal part of this novel. It is clear that in retrospect Windsor held
                     a special place in Mary Shelley's memories: it is the site, for instance, in which
                     she bases the early chapters of The Last Man (1826), with their idealized portraits
                     of herself and Percy Bysshe Shelley. </p> </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11787"><span class="term">the wind was contrary, and the stream of the river was too gentle </span> In other words, the boat was encountering a north wind blowing against their further
                  progress in that direction. By the time the Rhine reaches Cologne it has broadened
                  considerably, abating the strong current it bears through the mountainous country
                  further south. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11794"><span class="term">a wish . . . across me </span> In its context this is a striking revelation of Victor's deep, antisocial isolation,
                  which contrasts ironically with the passionate need for community that drives the
                  Creature and that has just been denied him, it would appear, forever. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11801"><span class="term">the wretch </span> By this time, we are so aware of how this kind of terminology distances and demonizes
                  the Creature that Victor's resort to it is perhaps only to be expected. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11809"><span class="term">Wretch! </span> At this late point in the novel this vocative is literally true, and the Creature
                  will acknowledge it so three paragraphs later. Still, we have to recognize that we
                  have come full circle: Walton addresses the Creature with the appellation employed
                  by Victor Frankenstein immediately after his creation (I:4:2 and note) and again upon
                  reencountering him on the Mer-de-Glace of Mont Blanc (II:2:5 and note). Two sentences
                  later he will reiterate Victor's linguistic leap into transcendental terminology,
                  demonizing the Creature as a fiend. In his response the Creature picks up on the shift
                  in signification, comparing himself both to Adam and to Satan. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11816"><span class="term">a year ago </span> At this point in the year before Victor and Henry resided in London and were preparing
                  to transfer their center of activity to Oxford. Elizabeth must be referring to the
                  despondent period the summer earlier, following Victor's confrontation by the Creature
                  beneath Mont Blanc. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11823"><span class="term">you, my friend </span> Not since Volume 1 (I:3:13, I:6:18 and note) have the narrative lines been broken
                  to remind us of the circumstances in which this story is being told. As was the case
                  in those instances Victor signals a new intensification in the circumstances of the
                  plot, with Henry Clerval reentering the novel. </li>
               <li class="item" id="d30e11830"><span class="term">young man </span> As the weight of circumstances and of tragedies accumulates it may be somewhat difficult
                  to remember the actual chronology of the novel. Victor is yet only 24 years old. </li>
