						<term>a black and comfortless sky</term>
						<p>After the allusions to hell in these paragraphs the absence of any conventional sign of heaven is starkly telling. So
							"hellish" has Victor's psychological state become that the universe seems to have changed to reflect it. Even as one
							posits moral or theological implications to this language, however, one must be conscious that the megalomania that
							allowed Victor to presume to usurp God's prerogatives in the first place might just as easily issue in changing the
							universe to suit the mood of his mind. </p>

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="4">
						<term>a foreign accent</term>
						<p>Victor's native tongue is French, which, the reader will recall, is a language Walton cannot speak (I:L2:02 and note).</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="5">
						<term>acquirement of the knowledge which I sought</term>
						<p>By the time Mary Shelley made these revisions, Goethe's Faust, Part I, had become a European classic. She knew the work
							well, not only because Percy Bysshe Shelley had translated parts of it during his last months, but because she had twice
							prepared the text of these—a partial version the first time, in The Liberal, the shortlived periodical the Shelleys,
							Byron, and Leigh Hunt had projected—and then in full in her 1824 publication of Posthumous Poems of Percy Bysshe Shelley.
							The Faustian desire for knowledge, of course, was also deeply implicated in the 1818 edition. Mary Shelley was introduced
							to it shortly after she began work on her novel when Matthew (Monk) Lewis, visiting Byron during the 1816 summer at
							Geneva, translated parts of it to the assembled company. Faust also had a profound effect on Byron's dramatic poem
							Manfred, begun shortly thereafter.</p>
						<p> The extent to which Walton here throws all caution to the winds will be balanced late in the novel by Victor
							Frankenstein's adoption of the same kind of rhetoric in appealing to the sailors on Walton's vessel to risk everything for
							the mission's success (See III:WC:14). It is at that point that Walton's prudence and essential humanity return, perhaps
							as a secondary effect of his having, in the meantime, by this outburst elicited Victor's sobering account of the cost to
							him and to those he loved of his passion for knowledge. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="6">
						<term>a design which she never found reason to repent</term>
						<p>The first-time reader of this sentence would see no reason to pause and ponder its import, but for one returning to the
							text and tracing its linguistic and thematic linkages, it would hard to understand how Victor could speak in such bland
							terms about circumstances his mother could not foresee but through which he has suffered inordinately. Moreover, not only
							does he have strong personal reason to repent this "design," but its fulfillment, as he bitterly knows, will result
							directly in the death of his father (III:6:16).</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="7">
						<term>advancement in his profession</term>
						<p>This, the first substantive change in the 1831 edition, speaks volumes on the shifts in consciousness that have taken place
							during the thirteen years separating the two editions. A separate middle-class identity and sense of upward mobility have
							become endemic in British cultural attitudes, bringing heroic concepts like glory firmly to earth.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="8">
						<term>well advanced on my voyage</term>
						<p>The supposition is that Walton has met with a ship above Finland at the end of the common sea-route out of the Russian port
							of Archangelsk. Here, at the top of Scandinavia, as Walton continues his northern voyage, the other ship prepares to curve
							in a southerly direction toward England. With its departure Walton loses his last contact with his domestic circle: from
							now on he must prepare himself to be in isolation.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="9">
						<term>a friend</term>
						<p>Slowly, if we compare this statement with the initial voicing of this theme in I:L2:2, it begins to take on secondary
							associations. Here, the primary value of friendship is to provide sympathy, which is here glossed not as mere compassion
							or genial fellow-feeling, but as a mirror for the self that will be conducive to personal growth.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="10">
						<term>again and again testify</term>
						<p>Only in retrospect will the conclusion of this letter take on additional meaning from the remarkably heightened rhetoric
							indulged in by Walton here at its end. For Walton so to "testify" is to "bear witness" before the world to a dependence
							upon and need for his sister. In a narrative in which solitude and obsessiveness will come to seem a threat to all
							normative human relationships, this prior assertion of the primacy of human affection bears an ideological import.
							Students of English Romantic poetry may even be reminded of the highly emotional faith with which Wordsworth turns to his
							sister Dorothy in "Lines Written a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey", a poem that will be quoted by Victor Frankenstein in an
							encomium to his friend Henry Clerval at a point of structural balance with this passage, at the beginning of Volume 3 of
							the novel (III:1:21).</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="11">
						<term>These reflections have dispelled the agitation</term>
						<p>We are thus invited to return at this point to the beginning of Walton's letter (and the novel), perhaps to reflect on the
							fact that the first noun we encounter in the novel is "disaster" (I:L1:1). Clearly, however he may publicly suppress their
							effects, Walton, to some extent at least, shares the "evil forebodings" of his sister he recalls in that initial sentence. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="12">
						<term>agony</term>
						<p>Several critics have noted the extent to which Mary Shelley goes out of her way, as Victor brings his creation to life, to
							transpose the physical pains of childbirth into an equivalent psychological state. </p>

						<term>Cornelius Agrippa</term>
						<p>Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim, 1486-1535, German mystic and alchemist.</p>
						<p>Agrippa of Nettesheim was born of a once-noble family near Cologne, and studied both medicine and law there, apparently
							without taking a degree. In 1503, he assumed the name Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim, adopting the von to suggest a
							noble background; three years later, he established a secret society in Paris devoted to astrology, magic, and Kabbalah.</p>
						<p>His career is diverse: secret agent, soldier, physician, orator, and law professor, in Cologne, Paris, Dôle, London, Italy,
							Pavia, and Metz. In 1509, he set up a laboratory in Dôle in the hopes of synthesizing gold, and for the next decade or so
							traveled Europe, making a living as an alchemist, and conversing with such important early humanist scholars as Colet and
							Reuchlin. In 1520, he set up a medical practice in Geneva, and in 1524 became personal physician to the queen mother at
							the court of King Francis I in Lyons. When the queen mother abandoned him, he began practicing medicine in Antwerp, but
							was later banned for practicing without a license, and became historiographer at the court of Charles V. After several
							stays in prison, variously for debt and criminal offenses, he died in 1535.</p>
						<p>Agrippa's wrote on a great many topics, including marriage and military engineering, but his most important work is the
							three-volume De occulta philosophiae (written c. 1510, published 1531), a defense of "hidden philosophy" or magic, which
							draws on diverse mystical traditions -- alchemy, astrology, Kabbalah. A later work, De incertitudine et vanitate
							scientiarum (Of the Uncertainty and Vanity of the Sciences), attacks contemporary scientific theory and practice.</p>
						<p>Many of his opinions were controversial. His early lectures on theology angered the Church, and his defense of a woman
							accused of witchcraft in 1520 led to his being hounded out of Cologne Cologne by the Inquisition. In his own day, Agrippa
							was widely attacked as a charlatan. After his death, legends about him were plentiful. Some believed him to be not only an
							alchemist but a demonic magician, even a vampire. In one account, he traveled to the New World.</p>
						<p>In 1799, Robert Southey published an amusing ballad on this man, suggestive of his later reputation as a master of black
							magic, as well as of his susceptibility to gothic trappings. Percy Bysshe Shelley listed Agrippa and Paracelsus among his
							favorite writers in a discussion with Godwin in 1812. </p>

						<term>experiments on an air-pump</term>
						<p>The air-pump—what a later age would call a vacuum-chamber—was an important part of any eighteenth-century chemical
							laboratory. Darwin, for instance, notes an experiment with an air-pump in the fifth of the Additional Notes to his Temple
							of Nature. </p>

						<term>Albertus Magnus</term>
						<p>Albertus Magnus (1193 or 1206-1280), German monk and alchemist, known as "Doctor Universalis."</p>
						<p>Born to a noble family in Bavaria, Albertus (Albert von Bollstüdt) became an adherent to the newly formed Dominican Order
							while he was a student at Padua in 1223. After being ordained in Germany, he traveled to Paris and in 1245 became master
							of theology at the University there. His most famous student was Thomas Aquinas. Albertus had a lifelong interest in the
							natural sciences (at a time when alchemy had not yet been sharply distinguished from more legitimate sciences such as
							chemistry), and was an important scholar of Aristotle, whose influence pervaded both his scientific and his religious
							writings.</p>
						<p>From 1260 to 1262, Albertus was the bishop of Regensburg, the nearest principal medieval city on the Danube to the north of
							Ingolstadt. He died in Cologne in 1280. Not long after his death, a number of writings on magic circulated under his name,
							although the validity of these attributions is questionable.</p>
						<p>Albertus was beatified in 1622. In 1931, Pope Pius XI declared him a saint and a Doctor of the Church; in 1941, Pope Pius
							XII named him the patron saint of those who study the natural sciences. </p>

						<term>a league</term>
						<p>This is how the Oxford English Dictionary represents this obsolete measure:</p>
						<p>LEAGUE</p>
						<p> league lig, sb.1 Forms: 4-5 leghe, 4-6 lege, leuge, (4 lewge, 5 lewke, leuke, leeke), 5-6 leege, 6 legge, le(a)que, Sc.
							lig, 6-7 leag(e, 6- league. Late ME. leuge, lege, leghe, etc., ad. late L. leuga, leuca (= late Gr. leu'gh, leu'kh),
							according to Hesychius and Jordanes a Gaulish word; hence OFr. liue, liwe (mod.Fr. lieue), Pr. lega, legua, Cat. llegua,
							Sp. legua, Pg. legoa, Ital. lega. </p>
						<p> An itinerary measure of distance, varying in different countries, but usually estimated roughly at about 3 miles; app.
							never in regular use in England, but often occurring in poetical or rhetorical statements of distance.</p>
						<p>Thus, a league outside Geneva. would be, perhaps, an hour's easy walk from the town. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="17">
						<term>the creature . . . might still be there, alive</term>
						<p>It is clear, to invoke the customary alternatives, that to Victor at this point "dead" would be far preferable to "alive."
							The ugliness of the morality behind his ruminations here seems not to occur to him.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="18">
						<term>all at once become so extremely wicked</term>
						<p>The doltishness with which Ernest speaks cannot obscure the moral question implicit here. The reliance on simplistic moral
							absolutes will extend outward from Ernest to involve his father (I:6:37), who has been established from the beginnings of
							Victor's narrative as a citizen of consequence, and he will then in the next chapter be joined by other men of consequence
							in Geneva, from the Church to the magistracy, in a miscarriage of justice. Victor's intuition of the murderer, as well as
							his own intellectual research beyond conventional limitations, isolates him from the other male upholders of establishment
							values. This does give Victor a certain moral authority not apparent before, but it is heavily shadowed by his silence as
							the travesty of Justine's trial unfolds. Only Elizabeth, like Justine a woman and without effectual power, is able through
							sheer human sympathy to "judge" aright in this case.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="19">
						<term>all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer, than that one guilty should escape</term>
						<p>Victor's bitterness over the law may reflect Godwin's teachings about its arbitrary nature and conformist tendencies, as
							well as Percy Bysshe Shelley's own legal problems with his father during Mary's first years living with him. We see
							similar sentiments in Elizabeth's aversion to the law as a profession for Ernest, which is expressed in a passage in the
							first edition (I:5:2 and note).</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="20">
						<term>with all my ardour</term>
						<p>This word, which as a noun entered the novel with Walton rhapsodizing over his passion for discovery (I:L4:20), is now
							picked up by Victor as if deliberately to echo and admonish the mariner. It will toll repetitively—and resonantly—through
							the remainder of this chapter. It seems clear that Mary Shelley, capitalizing on her strategy in 1818, is here emphasizing
							the word in all its ambiguity. The complex of associations in its definition can be tracked here. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="21">
						<term>Amadis</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley's journal notes indicate that she was sporadically reading in Robert Southey's translation of Amadis of Gaul,
							a Spanish chivalric romance by Garcia de Montalvo, during the early months of 1817. At this time she was also actively
							working on Frankenstein.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="22">
						<term>science of anatomy</term>
						<p>The University of Ingolstadt medical faculty and particularly the anatomy theater would have offered Victor unparalleled
							resources for pursuit of this new phase of his studies.</p>
						<p>The medical school, which today houses the German Museum of the History of Medicine, was known as the Anatomie upon its
							completion in 1736. That designation is still recalled in the street name on which the edifice stands. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="23">
						<term>ancestors</term>
						<p>Frankenstein is a novel that centers on a transgressive birth; it is replete with orphans and both women and men who, cut
							off in their youth, die without creating children of their own. In contrast to the actual terms of the work, Victor begins
							his narrative by emphasizing normative and extended family structures.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="24">
						<term>the Angel of Destruction</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley's emendations of 1831 once again link early statements in Victor's narrative with his condition when he is
							rescued by Walton's crew, a frantic and paranoid specter whose otherworldly mystifications, as expressed in the late
							chapters of Volume 3, are a driving force in his obsessive pursuit of the Creature. It is interesting to note that even
							this late in her work on the novel Mary Shelley is recalling the machinery with which Percy Bysshe Shelley invested his
							poem centering on the uncompromising pursuit of a love object, "Alastor; or, the Spirit of Solitiude," published in March
							of 1816, shortly before the two left for Switzerland.</p>

						<p>Coleridge's "Ancient Mariner" (1798), lines 451-56—with "who" substituted for "that" in line 451. (In the 1817 revision,
							the passage occupies lines 445-450.) The second direct allusion to this poem in the novel: the first occurs in Walton's
							second letter to Mrs. Saville (I:L2:6).</p>
						<p>"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner," is frequently also the subject of subtle allusion (see, for instance, I.2.7 and note, or
							III.1.8 and note) casts a long shadow over its conceptions.</p>
						<p>There is nothing odd about this, for Coleridge bore an unusual weight in the house in which Mary Godwin was raised. William
							Godwin, although separated from Coleridge on key matters of philosophy and theology, was deeply attached to him, calling
							him one of his four "oral instructors." Accordingly, Coleridge was a frequent guest in the Godwin household. Mary Shelley
							never forgot the experience of hearing Coleridge recite his "Rime" as she hid behind the sofa. Given Coleridge's
							brilliance in conversation, she may have imbibed more from her youthful encounters with him than a later time can ever
							know. Certainly, the implicit tribute accompanying her frequent allusions to him in the course of Frankenstein suggests a
							deep and personalized admiration. </p>

						<term>an omen</term>
						<p>Although as a novel Frankenstein is highly ingenious in its interweaving of omens, it also casts those who believe in them
							in a sharply reflexive light. In particular, Victor's account of his life as buffeted by a continual sway of destiny tends
							to exculpate him from responsibility for his choices and his actions.</p>

						<term>watchful with anxious thoughts</term>
						<p>Walton is anxious not just because his way is barred but because the icefield, in expanding, could easily crush the hull of

						<p>There have been veiled if persistent questions raised thus far about Victor's mental stability. These will slowly increase
							over the course of the novel, to such an extent, indeed, that near its end (III:WC:26), Walton has every reason to think
							he is himself listening to "the ravings of insanity." Questions of conventional expectations and of documentary evidence
							are present on all levels of this novel, in issues ranging from verisimilitude in writing to justice in society.</p>

					<item n="29">
						<term>a plain and simple explanation of the facts</term>
						<p>Justine discounts how much eloquence counts in her world, and in this novel (see, for instance, I:L4:24and note). But if a
							plain, unvarnished recital of facts cannot exonerate one, the novel asks, in what does truth exist? Compare Mary

						<term>this apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in reality, so distant</term>
						<p>This phrase, which is the first written in reflexive thought about the Creature, immediately establishes a threat to
							presumptions of scientific facticity, as the presence of this alien existence casts its shadow over all facile assumptions
							and assurances, leaving uncertainty in its wake. Such indeterminacy will increasingly come to dominate the narrative of
							events in Frankenstein. The fact that the Creature and Victor are traveling not over solid land but upon the fragile
							surface of ice is exactly emblematic of the problematic nature of reality that Mary Shelley introduces to the novel here.</p>

						<term>arrange in connected classifications</term>
						<p>Waldman points to a distinctive feature of scientific discourse of the later eighteenth and early nineteenth century. From
							Carolus Linnaeus (1707-1778), who in the study of botany established the terms for the classification of plants, to John
							Dalton (1766-1844) who in chemistry determined the universal table of atomic weights, late Enlightenment science was

						<term>as nearly as possible</term>
						<p>We will later discover (III:WC:4) that it was not "nearly" enough for Victor, who proceeds to rewrite Walton's narrative.
							But, then again, it could very well be his own narrative that he so conscientiously revises. Whatever the particular case
							is immaterial: what matters is the fact of emendation. Mary Shelley's deliberate accentuation of the unreliability of her

					</item>
					<item n="43">
						<term>astonishment of the students</term>
						<p>The condescension Victor so easily adopts toward Professor Krempe here seems to extend as well to his peers among the
							students. Within another chapter we will witness yet a further example of how Victor's sense of superiority combines with
							an almost instinctive aversion to those he considers in some sense inferior to him. His observation here may thus be
							intended by Mary Shelley to help prepare us for his sudden rejection of the Creature to whom he gives life. Yet it might
							also be designed to bear a double reading: not just that Victor's fellow-students are in awe of his commitment, but that
							they are aware of something neurotic in its intensity.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="44">
						<term>a strange tale</term>
						<p>When Walton resumes his narrative in Volume 3 (III:WC:1) his words will echo Victor's here, as he calls the narrative a
							"strange and terrific story" and acknowledges that the "tale is connected, and told with the appearance of the simplest
							truth," phrases suggestive of how broadly the judging of truth is an issue in the novel.</p>
						<p>This phrasing also introduces the complicating factor of the novel's deliberately involuted structure. To adapt Walton's
							language, Victor's account of the strange tale occurs within his own strange tale, which has already conveyed the
							narrative of William's death provided by his father (as well as, in the chapter before, Elizabeth's account of local
							doings). This tale will be told twice more, in the courtroom (I:7:6) and in the Creature's autobiographical summation
							(II:8:33). If, in the end, readers can assume that they are able to sift the truth from its excessive narrative
							elaboration, the fact remains that in the official account Justine Moritz will be known as the murderer, and no one in
							Victor's family—including Ernest, who will presumably inherit a substantial fortune and the position that goes with it and
							his family's reputation in Geneva—will ever be any the wiser. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="45">
						<term>at one time for five, and at another for nearly two years</term>
						<p>Justine, we remember from Elizabeth's letter to Victor (I:5:4), had come to imitate the expression and demeanor of Caroline
							Frankenstein. Thus, having lived with the Frankenstein family for seven years, which is the age at which William was
							murdered, she has in some sense become a surrogate for his mother who died when William was yet an infant. Further in the
							paragraph, Elizabeth explicitly compares her treatment of William as "like [that of] a most affectionate mother."</p>
						<p>This detail, which has no effect on anyone outside the family circle, would seem intended by Mary Shelley to insinuate a
							class bias into the court proceedings. Although Elizabeth speaks of her almost as a member of the family, she is not so
							seen by the judges or the populace of Geneva. Whatever the circumstance that separates her from an equality with other
							family members, the important issue is the very principle of separation by which she can be socially cast as a scapegoat. </p>

					<item n="46">
						<term>His daughter attended him</term>
						<p>The novel slides, seamlessly and without calling attention to itself, from Walton's nursing Victor Frankenstein back from a

							continual necessity in Frankenstein and a measure of a character's capacity for sympathy.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="47">
						<term>attended on him</term>
						<p>Walton here assumes the position of ministrant that Clerval held during Victor's "nervous fever" in Ingolstadt (I:4:17),
							pointedly an inversion of customary gender roles. Healers are accorded a privileged value in this novel, though by no
							means in the world that encompasses its fiction. Justine Moritz's attendance on Victor's mother in her final illness earns
							for her no particular credence from her judges (I:7:10), and his mother, contracting scarlet fever from nursing Elizabeth,
							dies as a result of her good offices (I:2:2)</p>

						<term>beauties of nature</term>
						<p>Readers have nothing at this point from which objectively to compare Walton's surmises. From Victor's own narration,

							as being (I:5:17); indeed, while engaged in his scientific pursuits, he confesses himself wholly oblivious to the
							attractions of the natural world (I:3:10). Rather than sense a narrative disjuncture from this evidence, however, we might
							consider it a deliberate attempt on Mary Shelley's part to distance herself and her readers from Walton's increasingly
							inflated language. The figure Victor will cut in his own narration is very much darker than the one to whom we are being
							introduced through Walton's eyes. The underlying problem of how perspective shapes reality is thus being subtly

					<item n="55">
						<term>Beautiful!</term>
						<p>Victor's instinctive aesthetic sense has already allowed him to misjudge his teacher, Professor Krempe (I:2:12). Now it
							operates to overpower any sense of shared humanity with the Creature. In respect to the master categories of
							eighteenth-century aesthetics, the Creature is exactly the opposite of the Beautiful: he is the embodiment of the Sublime,
							at once awesome and terrifying. If most of our experience with sublimity is mediated through art and literature, the
							Creature in all his encounters forces it with stunning immediacy into normative human life, always with disastrous
							consequences</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="56">
						<term>been destroyed</term>
						<p>Victor suddenly shows a political consciousness that has not been active up to this point. The context suggests that the
							enclosed world of the domestic affections, governed by a feminine sensibility, is threatened—and through history actually
							destroyed—by the masculinist drive for power. This is a sentiment with which both her father William Godwin and her
							husband Percy Bysshe Shelley would have agreed. In the shadow of the Napoleonic Wars and the reinstitution of reactionary
							monarchies across Europe, it is a sentiment not in accord with the prevailing state of political opinion in England.</p>
						<p>It could be argued that Victor simply serves momentarily as mouthpiece for the author's pointedly liberal views to surface.
							What would complicate that supposition is the fact that this series of political failures is identical with those the
							Creature derives from the oral reading of Volney's Ruins of Empire by Felix De Lacey (see II:5:14). If we focus on that
							identity retrospectively, we are suddenly confronted with the amazing fact that Victor, whether he registered it or not,
							will actually learn something concrete from the Creature's narration in the second volume of the novel. </p>

					<item n="57">

					<item n="58">
						<term>a being which had the shape of a man</term>
						<p>Walton's innocent description of the Creature names him in relation to a human community. The ship's lieutenant in

							him as a "man," whereupon Victor automatically renames him as "daemon."</p>
						<p/>

					<item n="59">
						<term>Belrive</term>
						<p>Bellerive (which connotes "beautiful shore") is a suburb of Geneva, situated north of the city on the western shore of the
							lake as it narrows towards its end and thus affording a picturesque view of Geneva and the mountains beyond it. That the
							Frankenstein family possesses a country house testifies to their comparative wealth and social standing in the community,
							an issue that will be of some moment to the trial recounted in I:7:1. After its painful conclusion the family will seek
							tranquillity in a return to the comfortable setting of this country house (II:1:5).</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="60">
						<term>Belrive</term>
						<p>Bellerive is where the fifteen-year-old Victor witnessed the violent thunderstorm (I:1:22) that started his obsession with
							the powers of electricity: thus, it is particularly appropriate that the "most violent storm" occurs in this area. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="61">
						<term>Their benevolent disposition</term>
						<p>The repetition of the adjective "benevolent" three times in as many paragraphs indicates the stress Mary Shelley places on
							this as a fundamental attribute of human virtue. However it may be stressed in Victor's memory, the frequency with which
							such benevolence is actually encountered as a motivating force will be tested when the Creature flees Victor's apartment
							and attempts to make his way in the world.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="62">
						<term>benevolently</term>
						<p>Victor's stress on the term marks it as of particular importance to him and indicates that it is also of concern to the
							novel. With some pathos, Victor will begin the second volume by recalling that he had himself "begun life with benevolent
							intentions" (II:1:1). At this point we cannot know how far from disinterested benevolence Victor has strayed. In
							retrospect, however, the novel's readers can easily comprehend why fervent emotions would be generated in him by a return
							to civilized human standards and ethical conduct.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="63">
						<term>bestowing on the state sons</term>
						<p>As Walton's first letter opens with an expression of the opposed perspectives of men and women (I:L1:1 and note), so this
							initial paragraph of the first chapter accentuates the concern of the patriarchy with replicating itself. Alphonse
							Frankenstein's sense of public purpose is to reproduce himself for the good of the state. By suppressing the role of the
							female in this process, he paradoxically voices what will become his son's obsession with creating a new man without the
							intervention of woman. With that creation in mind, however, it does not require of the reader an undue stretching of the
							sense to regard the distinctive tone of this language, so abstracted and clinical, as being more characteristic of Victor
							than of his father.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="64">
						<term>bestowing animation upon lifeless matter</term>
						<p>Although not the elixir of life per se (which would give the owner perpetual youth), Victor Frankenstein's discovery is

							has been his ruling passion over the past eight years.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="65">
						<term>Louisa Biron</term>
						<p>This would appear to be an in-joke among the writing friends, since Lord Byron's name, in Geneva, would have been

							Allegra, the illegitimate daughter Claire Clairmont bore in January 1817, the name of Biron.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="66">
						<term>the blackest ingratitude</term>
						<p>The same noun is employed by Alphonse Frankenstein in the previous chapter (I:6:37). The word conveys a sense of obligation
							and therefore of class difference. Again and again it is emphasized that Justine has been raised above her rank in life by
							the active interest of the Frankenstein household in her welfare. But has she really altered her condition? Not just the
							family but the whole of Geneva society condescend to her as having less than full rights to her supposedly respectable
							condition. The ease with which her claims to equity are abrogated implicitly places her on a par with Victor's Creature,
							named a wretch and denied the claim of human sympathy.</p>
						<p/>

					</item>
					<item n="68">
						<term>blame</term>
						<p>What is odd about this statement is not the sense of guilt embedded in it—Victor, we will learn, has much to acknowledge on
							that score—but how unpenitent is the language that expresses it. Victor's "not . . . altogether" phrase so strongly hedges
							the confession that it calls attention to his rhetoric as self-serving, less than candid, and perhaps not to be wholly
							trusted. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="69">
						<term>that blank incapability of invention</term>
						<p>Although Mary Shelley surely exaggerates the time it took her to begin her novel as well as the anxious writer's block that
							inhibited her starting forth, there is a more serious aspect to this account than her personal uncertainties. Questions
							concerning the circumstances of and responsibility for creativity, the attitude with which intellectual ambition
							approaches the unknown, and the moral neutrality of the human imagination, are deeply inlaid within the structure of
							Frankenstein. There is thus a sense in which this personal account in her Introduction seems intended to focus attention
							on such larger, more public concerns with which the reader will soon be asked to grapple.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="70">
						<term>blasted stump</term>
						<p>That the power that Victor will use to create life is initially associated with destruction is significant for the symbolic

						<p>That the forces of nature are equally devoted to creation and destruction is an issue whose dynamics are central to Byron's

						<p>The difference in the Genesis account of human creation could not be more pronounced:</p>

							and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth

						<p>1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</p>

							have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the
							earth.</p> Victor's adjective "breathless" may be intended by Mary Shelley to resonate ironically against the moment in
						Genesis in which Adam is actually brought to life: 2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed

							and the Nore in the spring of 1797. The Shelleys' friend Leigh Hunt wrote several attacks on the practice in his weekly

						<term>Buffon</term>
						<p>Georges Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, 1707-1788, French naturalist.</p>
						<p>Buffon spelled out his views in his monumental Natural History (Histoire naturelle, générale et particulière), an attempt
							to present systematically all the known facts of natural science, of which the first volumes appeared in 1749 and the
							final volumes in 1804.</p>
						<p>Buffon rejected Linnaeus's method of classifying species, insisting instead on smooth gradations between not only species
							but individual organisms. Although he was willing to use anatomical structures to make working distinctions between
							species, he believed any division into orders, classes, genera, and species misrepresented the variety of nature.</p>
						<p>His own experiments, however, caused him to think seriously about the idea of the species. Buffon discovered that animals
							of different species could be crossbred, but the offspring were infertile: he therefore defined a species as a group of
							animals that could produce fertile offspring.</p>
						<p>Buffon did believe in the idea of the mutation of species, and was the first to suggest the possibility that all animals
							might have descended or evolved ultimately from a single breeding pair. He rejected the notion of evolution, however,
							favoring instead a devolutionary theory: animals over time fell off by degrees from their originally perfect state. The
							broad range of his scientific interest includes subjects of direct import for Frankenstein: comparative geography, the
							diversification of types within a species, the sexual origin of species, and monsters. </p>
						<p>Buffon's most important work in physical anthropology appeared in The Varieties of the Human Species (1749), in which he
							described the physical and cultural differences between groups of humans. He attributed these differences to the races'
							accommodation to different environmental conditions.</p>
						<p>This well-known theory is alluded to in a letter that Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote his long-time friend Thomas Love Peacock
							during the Geneva summer of 1816. That citation, in turn, was included in the last letter appended to Mary Shelley's
							History of a Six Weeks' Tour. </p>

						<p>Having twice in his letters to his sister (I:L2:5 and I:L3:3) assured her of his prudence, Walton here becomes carried away

							designating a feature shared by the male protagonists whose value, like the other shared attribute of curiosity, is
							complexly ambiguous. He has already declared himself overly ardent (I:L1:2). Soon, we will observe the same problem in

						<term>cannot begin life anew</term>
						<p>Although the extent of Victor's losses must await his own narration, his despairing language here calls attention to itself

							renew life is, in some profound sense, not truly alive, a condition made famous by Coleridge in the idea of
							"Life-in-Death" advanced in "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner," line 193. Philosophically speaking, Victor's language

						<p>This was the work on which Byron was working during the summer of 1816. It was carried to his publisher John Murray by

						<term>catastrophe</term>
						<p>The powerful wrench to the language here replicates the effect of Victor's awaking from his dreams into a new and alien

							novel's first sentence (I:L1:1) as foreseeing for Walton's expedition. The stark word would have borne another kind of
							resonance in Mary Shelley's culture: Buffon'sNatural History gave wide currency to a catastrophic theory of creation, and
							Victor's adolescent delight in that account (at least as it is recounted in the first edition of the novel—see I:1:25)
							would thus seem to have left an indelible, ironic imprint on him.</p>

					<item n="88">
						<term>Roman Catholic</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley's general dismissal of Roman Catholicism in this novel should be placed within the context of centuries of

						<p>This suggests that Walton implicitly recognizes the third element, after electricity and magnetism, in what would in the

						<p> That a unified field theorem is a still unrealized ideal of experimental physics, one that has excited the ambitions of
							major scientific minds in all quarters of the world, may indicate the seriousness of the scientific issues and passions
							underlying Mary Shelley's novel. Without denigrating those ambitions here, she characteristically reminds us of human

							celestial observations would be impossible. </p>

						<term>I have changed no portion of the story</term>
						<p>Most modern commentators would dispute this statement strongly, taking exception both stylistically and substantively, and
							tending to see the 1831 edition as truly a reconception of the 1818 edition rather than the tidying-up suggested here. But
							it is not entirely easy to focus categorically on the differences between the texts. Some political innuendos of moment in
							1818, for instance, were no longer relevant to the changed climate in the year before the Great Reform Bill, but that does
							not mean that others—for instance, the curious intrusion of imperialism into the plot (see I:6:14 and note)—have not taken
							their place. Mary Shelley did greatly rewrite the first chapter of 1818 breaking it into two separate chapters in 1831.
							She similarly reworked the opening chapter of Volume 2. Throughout her revision she endeavors to flesh out her characters
							rather than merely to add descriptive elements to the novel. In this regard, her most extensive elaboration is in making
							Victor's account of his life from the very beginning subtly reflect the paranoid mental condition to which experience has
							reduced him.</p>

					<item n="92">
						<term>enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety</term>
						<p>This poses a contrast worth contemplating: on the one hand, as earlier in the chapter (I:3:8 and note), enthusiasm here
							literally suggests the presence of an indwelling deity, or at least Victor's aspiration to play God; on the other hand,
							anxiety indicates a counterforce within his mind, disrupting his self-assurance, even prompting self-alienation. Since in
							Milton's myth Satan is created as a counterforce at the precise moment that God announces his plan to create a new race,
							these contrary poles are essential to the basic creation myth in terms of which Mary Shelley plots her novel.</p>

						<p>Victor's blasé consent is in sharp contrast with his sense of follow-through, and his truancy from school is indicative of

						<term>rational theory of chemistry</term>
						<p>During the latter part of the eighteenth-century the life sciences were undergoing a radical transformation of their

							conceptual ordering and deductive animism inherited from medieval and Renaissance paradigms. The exacting science of
							chemistry influenced these developments and, in turn, was given impetus by the responsiveness of the life sciences to
							their renewed systemization. When Victor speaks of a "rational theory," he means, at least in part, such a logical
							ordering of constituent knowledge within the discipline. In the early decades of the nineteenth century, particularly in
							Great Britain under the guidance of figures like John Dalton and Humphrey Davy, chemistry made enormous advances in basic
							knowledge, winning for the discipline something of a cachet among educated people. </p>

							Victorian, another sign of the major shift in British culture during the 1820s. The nostalgic sentimentality, however,

						<p>Frankenstein is a novel haunted by the spectre of death. Not yet a quarter of the way through the novel, the reader will

							pattern, death has touched each chapter of the novel, first as Walton recounts how he inherited a fortune upon the death
							of an unnamed cousin (I:L1:4and note), the decline of Alphonse Frankenstein's friend Beaufort (I:1:2), the sudden demise
							of Caroline Frankenstein (I:2:2), Victor's nocturnal visits to vaults and charnel houses (I:3:3), his association of his
							Creature with mummies and ghouls (I:4:4), and the death of Justine's three siblings and mother in this paragraph. The
							actual context for this narrative should, of course, not be forgotten, an unexplored reach of the Arctic wilderness where

						<term>chivalry and romance</term>
						<p>An inordinate interest in chivalry, suggestive of an investment in archaic notions of manners and social hierarchy,

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="101">
						<term>they sought the pleasant climate of Italy</term>
						<p>Whether Mary Shelley, in framing her revisions, intended to give her novel a geographical symmetry by placing an Italian
							sojourn in the early part of Victor's narrative to balance that of Safie and her father at its absolute center
							(1831:II:14:12) can be only a matter of conjecture. It is consistent, however, with the strong structural patterning of
							the novel. By 1831, of course, she might simply have decided to translate her own experience into the rewriting of the
							novel, for it was certainly the case that she and Percy Bysshe Shelley sought Italy in 1818, just months after the
							publication of Frankenstein, ostensibly for reasons of health.</p>
						<p>One consequence of the considerable emendation made to this first chapter of Victor's narrative is to emphasize how well
							off his family is. To see the sights of Italy is one thing; to make a leisurely tour of the country, then extend the
							excursion to take in France and Germany, requires substantial means as well as leisure. In the 1818 text the Frankensteins
							were respected members of their community; by 1831 they have assumed something of the trappings of aristocracy. </p>

						<term>the story of Columbus and his egg</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley read this anecdote in Washington Irving's Life and Adventures of Christopher Columbus (1828), Book V, Chapter
							7, where it is used to applaud the explorer's "practical sagacity." Her light emphasis here on the achievements of great
							explorers and the uses to which their knowledge is put might be thought to press issues of considerable importance to the
							novel she is introducing. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="104">
						<term>communication</term>
						<p>Walton raises for the first time a major concern of the novel, the aims, uses, and potential limitations of writing.
							Although he affirms the importance here of a human presence that will guarantee unmediated sympathy, still he does so in
							the form of a written letter that in the previous sentence names his correspondent ("Margaret") and in the sentence to
							follow strongly links her to him by a charged term of endearment ("my dear sister"). The logic of this letter, indeed,
							suggests the actual limitations of the unmediated exchange. Although he admires the officers of his ship, for instance,
							Walton cannot expect their sympathy in the refined emotions he here transmits to his distant sister.</p>
						<p>At the same time, Victor Frankenstein's retreat into obsessive study and his Creature's enforced isolation will show the
							consequences of trying to fall back upon one's own singular resources. That Mary Shelley regards the communication of
							emotion as fundamental to human need and experience seems implicit in her choice of an epistolary form in which to frame
							her novel. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="105">
						<term>the manner in which I should employ it</term>
						<p>It seems never to cross Victor's mind that he might not "employ" his discovery or even that he might collaborate with
							others in its practical application. As the paragraph goes on, it is also clear that the number of options Victor
							considers for his discovery is very limited. To invoke the terminology of a later day, rather than publishing his
							discovery, he decides to author it. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="106">
						<term>confessed her guilt</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley contorts the plot somewhat to force this detail upon it. This is of a piece with her concentration on
							individual responsibility, but it also stresses the element of social coercion that brings about this miscarriage of
							justice. That Justine will prevaricate in a situation where Victor cannot bring himself to speak the truth once more
							underscores how relative is the nature of truth in this novel.</p>

						<term>My confessor has besieged me</term>
						<p>Early nineteenth-century English anti-Catholic prejudice stressed the hierarchical conformity of the Roman Church as

							emphasized. Yet if this confessor is manipulative and reminds one of that staple of Gothic fiction, the obdurate
							inquisitor, he seems to stand in contrast to the earlier confessor, who acted as a kindly mender of family fences to
							convince her mother after the deaths of her other children to take Justine back into her home (I:5:6). Of course, he could
							be the same priest, only apparently kind in his offices, but essentially superstitious in interpreting God's will and

						<term>contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley seems to understand with acuity a phenomenon that could only have just come into general awareness in her

							a disciplinary partnership with the physical sciences. From that point forward all notions of distinct animistic or

						<p>Ordinarily in the writings of the English Romantics, and particularly in the contemporaneous poems of Byron (Childe

						<p>If one reads back from this point into the previous paragraph, it is evident that Victor has attempted in some sense to

						<p>In evoking traditional martial virtues Walton unwittingly echoes Milton's Satan who stresses this and other such heroic

							between Victor Frankenstein and his Creature in the novel, an attachment based more and more on passionate revenge.</p>
						     What though the field be lost?<lb/> All is not lost; the unconquerable will,<lb/> And study of revenge, immortal

						<p>The caveat about Walton's boasting of his courage in the opening letter (I:L1:6), and at the beginning of the second

						<p>This, the second death in as many paragraphs, almost slips by without notice. But surely Walton might have been left a

							whom we may assume was of an age comparable to his. This unexpected source of his independence, means sufficiently ample
							to allow him to hire a crew and outfit an ocean-going vessel for a lengthy voyage, testifies to the instability of

						<term>Partly from curiosity</term>
						<p>As Victor exactly echoes the diction used by Walton to explain his eagerness to hear the account to which he now listens
							(I:L4:31, and note), Mary Shelley reverts to the notion of curiosity as being, for better or worse, a fundamental human
							trait that impels the actions of all the major characters in the novel. Often, as here, the interest is wholly idle and
							unmotivated.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="125">
						<term>curiosity</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley reverts to the characteristic (and problem) of human curiosity first broached in Walton's Letter (I:L1:2) and
							continued in the opening chapter of Victor's narrative. Late in the novel Walton's curiosity will also function to
							establish for the first and only time a momentary bridge between Victor's Creature and humanity (III:WC:38).</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="126">
						<term>ardent curiosity</term>
						<p>The initial posing of a highly problematic theme of the novel, the thirst for knowledge as an end in itself. The same theme
							implicates "Alastor," Percy Bysshe Shelley's major poem written in 1815, and published in March of the next year, four
							months before Mary Shelley conceived the idea for Frankenstein, as well as William Godwin's first great success in
							fiction, The Adventures of Caleb Williams (1792): whose fourth paragraph begins, "The spring of action which, perhaps more
							than any other, characterised the whole train of my life, was curiosity."</p>

					<item n="127">
						<term>dæmon</term>
						<p>This is the term that, as his narrative proceeds into Volume 3, Victor will increasingly use to denominate his Creature.
							But to have it thus introduced here without any preparation, and in this peculiar period spelling, is to raise a serious
							question as to what exactly Victor may intend by the term. Walton's interpolation, "as he called him," emphasizes the
							importance of perspective in any such definition and may even indicate his own lack of assurance about what is meant by
							Victor's usage.</p>
						<p>Samuel Johnson's Dictionary (1755) is uncharacteristically reductive in its definition:</p>
						<p>DEMON, n.s. [dæmon, Latin; daimôn.] A spirit; generally an evil spirit; a devil.</p>
						<p>The Oxford English Dictionary, in contrast, exhibits the full range and complexity of the word's history. (The examples are
							here abridged.)</p>DEMON<p>demon 1. Also 6-9 dæmon. In form, and in sense 1 a, a. L. dæmon (med.L. demon) spirit, evil
							spirit, a. Gr. dai'mwn divinity, genius, tutelary deity. But in sense 1 b and 2, put for L. dæmonium, Gr. daimo'nion,
							neuter of daimo'nioj adj. '(thing) of divine or dæmonic nature or character', which is used by the LXX, N. Test., and
							Christian writers, for 'evil spirit'. Cf; Fr. dimon (in Oresme 14th c. dimones); also 13th c. demoygne = Pr. demoni,
							Ital., Sp. demonio, repr. L. dæmonium, Gr. daimo'nion.</p>1.<p>a. In ancient Greek mythology (= dai'mwn): A supernatural
							being of a nature intermediate between that of gods and men; an inferior divinity, spirit, genius (including the souls or
							ghosts of deceased persons, esp. deified heroes). Often written dæmon for distinction from sense 2.</p>
						<p>b. Sometimes, particularly, An attendant, ministering, or indwelling spirit; a genius. (Chiefly in references to the
							so-called 'dæmon of Socrates'; Socrates himself claimed to be guided, not by a dai'mwn or dæmon, but by a daimo'nion,
							divinum quiddam (Cicero), a certain divine principle or agency, an inward monitor or oracle. It was his accusers who
							represented this as a personal dæmon, and the same was done by the Christian Fathers (under the influence of sense 2),
							whence the English use of the word, as in the quotations. See tr. Zeller's Socrates iv. 73; Riddell, Apology of Plato,
							Appendix A.).</p>2. An evil spirit.<p>a. (Representing daimo'nion of the LXX and N.T. (rarely dai'mwn); in Vulgate
							dæmonium, dæmon). Applied to the idols or gods of the heathen, and to the 'evil' or 'unclean spirits' by which demoniacs
							were possessed or actuated. A Jewish application of the Greek word, anterior to Christianity. Daimo'nia is used several
							times by the LXX to render shedim 'lords, idols', and secirim 'hairy ones' (satyrs or he-goats), the latter also rendered
							ma'taia 'vain things'. It is also frequent in the Apocrypha (esp. in Tobit), and in the N.T., where in one instance (Matt.
							viii. 31) dai'monej occurs in same sense. In the Vulgate generally rendered dæmonium, pl. -ia, but once in O.T. (Lev.
							xvii. 7), and in 10 places in N.T. (8 in St. Matthew) dæmon, pl. -es. These words are indiscriminately translated deofol
							in the Ags. Gospels, feend or deuil in Wyclif, and in all the 16-17th c. versions devil; the Revisers of 1881-5 substitute
							demons in Deut. and Psalms, but in the N.T. retain devil, -s, in the text, with the literal translation demon, -s, in the
							margin. Quite distinct from this is the word properly translated 'Devil', dia'boloj, which is not used in the plural. It
							is owing to this substitution of devil in the Bible versions, that demon is not found so early in this, as in the popular
							sense b, which arose out of this identification.</p>
						<p>b. In general current use: An evil spirit; a malignant being of superhuman nature; a devil.</p>
						<p>c. Applied to a person (animal or agency personified), of malignant, cruel, terrible, or destructive nature, or of hideous
							appearance. (Cf. devil.)</p>
						<p>d. fig. An evil passion or agency personified. spec. an alcoholic drink. Also attrib.</p>
						<p>e. Applied to a being of superhuman or 'diabolical' energy, skill, etc. (cf. 3 a spec.); also to an action, etc.</p>
						<p>Accordingly, although Victor Frankenstein obviously wishes to "demonize" his Creature as a kind of fiend or devil (as in
							2b), in both his actual encounters with him, the Creature acts as a kind of conscience in the sense of 1a (II:2:7,
							III:3:13), reminding him of his duties as a creator. In later chapters of the novel, where a complex doubling effect
							occurs, it seems at times as if the Creature were, indeed, an inner genius, as in 1b. The Creature does, of course, have
							the hideous appearance defined in 2c, and he exhibits the extraordinary energy and skill noted in 2e, aspects that remind
							us that Victor himself fabricated his Creature to be superhuman. This sense of his own responsibility for the Creature's
							nature is exactly what is canceled by Victor's calling him a demon. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="128">
						<term>dæmon</term>
						<p>Against the very mundane cruelty of a miscarriage of human justice, Victor seems to feel obliged to inflate the terms as a
							means of assuaging his guilt. His rhetoric transcendentalizes his Creature, who can thus be conceived as beyond human
							suffering, as maliciously sporting with life. With a nice irony, the Creature will use exactly the same terms on Victor
							when they later meet: see II:2:7 and note.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="129">
						<term>Dante</term>
						<p>In the lower circles of the Inferno, Dante represents sinners grotesquely transfigured by the nature of their sins, as
							their physical presence imitates the moral condition of their souls. For Victor to invoke Dante in this manner, however,
							is to remind us that in his medieval Christian universe no one is born damned, but rather must actively estrange the self
							from God's merciful love in order to embrace damnation as a principle of one's being. Victor also unwittingly raises the
							disturbing question that will be underscored in the ensuing paragraph: in a world where man plays God, what is the state
							of damnation and what constitutes hell?</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="130">
						<term>I dared not advance</term>
						<p>This may be a premonition of Victor's own complicity in William's death, or it can be read as one of several instances
							where we observe on his part a chronic hesitancy to act. This will return in the third volume as a near-paralysis of the
							will. It is perhaps a natural reaction of one who has pursued one course of action with compulsive energy (see I:3:9) and
							then finds himself unable to undo or even cope with the result.</p>

						<term>the dark tyranny of despair</term>
						<p>The theme of dejection is a significant component of "dark" Romanticism. The most influential exploration of it in the
							canon of British Romanticism is that found in "Dejection: An Ode" by Coleridge, whose "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" has
							already figured in the structure of the novel (I:L2:6). Of the major Romantic poets (besides Percy Bysshe Shelley),
							Coleridge seems to have had the greatest impact on Mary Shelley's writing in Frankenstein.</p>

						<term>Dr. Darwin</term>
						<p>Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802). The reference is almost certainly to his last work, The Temple of Nature; or, the Origin of
							Society: A Poem, with Philosophical Notes, published posthumously in 1803.</p>
						<p>Its cryptic citation in the opening paragraph of the Preface testifies to the major importance of this work for the
							conceptual structuring of Frankenstein, particularly in the electromagnetic linkage of the scientific concerns of Victor
							Frankenstein and Robert Walton, as well as for the conspicuous and strange polar setting of the novel. The relevant note
							is the twelfth in the appendix.</p>
						<p>What exactly Percy Bysshe Shelley is referring to in his glancing citation of The Temple of Nature is harder to discern.
							That he knew the work intimately can be discerned by how much its form, as well as its science, contribute to the
							underlying conception of Queen Mab (1813) and its two-book redaction published in the Alastor volume in March 1816, "The
							Daemon of the World." In respect to Frankenstein, he is probably thinking of Darwin's notion of creation as occuring from
							the dynamic interaction of polar opposites in Book I.227ff, or its extension in the notion of life and death as
							interacting forces in Book IV.375ff. Likewise, of relevance (though wholly erroneous in its suppositions) is the first of
							the Additional Notes in the appendix, on "Spontaneous Vitality of Microscopic Animals." Darwin also has a curious
							exposition of male reproduction in nature without the intercession of females: see Book II, section III, somewhat
							elaborated in the eighth of the Additional Notes. </p>

						<term>the daughter of two persons of distinguished literary celebrity</term>
						<p>Although Mary Shelley publishes this revision of her novel pseudonymously, as by "The Author of The Last Man, Perkin
							Warbeck, &amp;C. &amp;C.," she writes as though she had signed her full name to the title page, speaking
							familiarly of her husband toward the end of the Introduction as "Shelley" (see I:Intro:7) and here casting her parents,
							William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft, as almost legendary, if historical, figures whom she need not bother to name.
							Constrained to keep the Shelley name out of the press by the meager allowance Sir Timothy Shelley had reluctantly settled
							upon his grandson, and thus remaining, as her opening paragraph indicates, "very averse to bringing [her]self forward in
							print" (see I:Intro:1), Mary Shelley nonetheless goes out of her way here to establish her major credentials as an artist
							and her strong claim to public notice. An appearance of modesty to cloak an unladylike presumption is a standard ploy of
							women writers at this time.</p>

					<item n="134">
						<term>dauntless courage</term>
						<p>Having in the previous letter (I:L1:4) already employed language associated with Milton's Satan, here Mary Shelley directly

						<p>     his face<lb/> Deep scars of thunder had intrencht, and care<lb/> Sat on his faded cheek, but under brows<lb/> Of
							dauntless courage, and considerate pride<lb/> Waiting revenge.<lb/> -- I.600-604</p>
						<p>The author's purpose seems not to be one of branding this crew with a diabolic association (though it is true that they
							will later become united in rebellion against their master), but rather this early on in the novel to plant motifs that
							will serve as unifying structural and thematic devices as Mary Shelley begins to interweave multiple narrative lines. In
							this case the association of the heroic and the Satanic will provide a perspective in which the reader will later frame
							both Victor Frankenstein and his Creature. </p>

						<p>In his earlier letter (I:L1:3 and note) Walton had also singled-out this faculty of imaginative reverie. As there, the tone

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="137">
						<term>day dreams</term>
						<p>The customary term for such a faculty in literature of the Romantic period is imagination. Yet, the connotations of
							Walton's diction do not aspire to such a level of import, a "day dream" implying something less substantial than a
							reverie, which itself signifies a mental state much less imposing than a vision. This implicit deflation of the power or
							value of the imagination will become a thematic undertone in the novel. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="138">
						<term>days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue</term>

						<p>Although there have been several deaths already confronted in the novel—those of Walton's cousin (I:L1:4), of Caroline's
							father (I:1:5), and of Elizabeth's mother (I:1:7)—this is the first that is not simply reported, but is enacted before the
							reader. That Caroline's death is a consequence of selfless nurture suggests that this is an expectation of women that is
							not without danger. Mary Shelley could not have failed to recognize that, in focusing so sharply on the death of Caroline
							Frankenstein as being brought on by her stepdaughter, she was in some sense rehearsing the death of her own mother Mary
							Wollstonecraft following her birth. Critics have likewise traced the novel's twin emphases on responsibility and guilt to

							(marginally human) to monster (inhuman) to demon (antihuman). And howsoever the Creature is named or names himself, as he

					<item n="144">
						<term>its departure . . . </term>
						<p>The shift in pronouns here (from "its" to "he") is telling but hardly indicative of a sudden sense of human identification

							upon him. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="145">
						<term>a depraved wretch</term>
						<p>The phrasing suggests not just a vile being, as "wretch" was used in I:4:3 and I:4:6, but now also one who is corrupt,
							wicked. Victor, who has no discernible religious belief or instruction, has wandered into a treacherous theological
							morass. The Judeo-Christian God has created humanity, in Milton's words, "just and right,/ Sufficient to have stood,
							though free to fall" (Paradise Lost, III.98-99). Victor, however, as God's stand-in, has no assurance that his Creature is
							without flaw. Having constructed him from whatever bodily parts he could lay his hands on (and without any particular
							nicety that they even be human), Victor presumes a correlation between body and soul, both being corrupt. In theological
							terms, however, such a vision of God as the creator of evil is fundamentally heretical, for it would hold God directly
							responsible for human depravity. Victor's chain of thoughts does not extend so far as openly to convict himself of the
							responsibility for the evil he assigns his Creature. Yet, his sudden sense here of their twin relationship does suggest
							the glimmer of that terrible truth the novel will slowly unfold.</p>
						<p>Johnson's 1755 Dictionary represents the verb to deprave with an uncharacteristic lack of discrimination:</p> To vitiate;
						to corrupt; to contaminate. <p>The Oxford English Dictionary, on the other hand, registers historical and theological shifts
							in usage:</p>
						<p>depravity An extension of pravity (ad. L. pravitas) previously used in same sense, after deprave and its derivatives. (No
							corresponding form in Latin or French.) The quality or condition of being depraved or corrupt.</p>
						<p>a. Perverted or corrupted quality. Obs.</p>
						<p>b. Perversion of the moral faculties; corruption, viciousness, abandoned wickedness.</p>
						<p>c. Theol. The innate corruption of human nature due to original sin. Often total depravity: In common use from the time of
							Jonathan Edwards: the earlier terms were pravity and depravation.</p>
						<p>d. A depraved act or practice.</p>
						<p>depraved</p>

					<item n="146">
						<term>destiny</term>
						<p>If we revert to the actual chronology of Frankenstein, we realize that it was only the day before that Victor had told
							Walton that his "fate [was] nearly fulfilled" (I:L4:32 and note), but left the reasons for that assurance totally
							unarticulated. In the present narration he will slowly begin to explore the range of determinants of his "destiny,"
							starting a few paragraphs earlier by acknowledging that it ought to have been tied to his patriarchal inheritance as a set
							of understood family obligations (I:1:1), a duty that is here to be set in opposition to a self-absorbed obsession with
							scientific discovery, which is the evil "genius" he will now delineate. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="147">
						<term>destiny</term>
						<p>Once again, as in the previous chapter (I:1:15), Victor suggests that the course of his development is not of his own
							making, but was necessitated by his professional commitment. His linking of his destiny to scientific knowledge has the
							effect of transferring the systematic logic of the discipline to the random events of his life, an inductive leap that,
							however much it may lack a rational base, will bear profound consequences.</p>

					<item n="149">
						<term>a new, and a not less terrible, disaster</term>
						<p>In her revision Mary Shelley seems conscious of the uncanny freight this word carries from beyond the novel. It is, we

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="150">
						<term>a disciple of Albertus Magnus</term>
						<p>The first such disciple of Albertus Magnus was his student Thomas Aquinas, who was the greatest medieval systematizer of
							knowledge in the Aristotelian mode of division and subdivision and by no means a proselytizer for alchemy. Albertus
							Magnus, it should be noted, was for a time the bishop of Regensburg, the nearest principal medieval city on the Danube to
							the north of Ingolstadt, the university city to which Victor travels in the next chapter (I:2:8). Though he attributes the
							choice of university to his parents (I:2:1), perhaps Victor's sense of discipleship to the bishop contributed to his
							acquiescence.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="151">
						<term>dissecting room</term>
						<p>Here Victor is explicit about his dependence on the anatomical theater of the University of Ingolstadt. Although nowhere in

							eighteenth century included a state-of-the art anatomy theater and dissecting table, this detail does appear to indicate
							an awareness of the exact particulars of the institution.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="152">
						<term>distillation</term>
						<p>Frankenstein's inclusion of distillation among the "processes of which my favourite authors were utterly ignorant" is

						<term>diverted our solicitude from our own situation</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley is insinuating an irony whose burden will not be clear to the reader for several chapters. Although the

							another human being, this particular being has never in his existence been the object of either human identification or
							sympathy.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="157">
						<term>divine wanderer</term>
						<p>It is hard for a reader not to think that such inflated phrasing was intended by Mary Shelley to be read ironically. Yet
							even if these terms do call attention to themselves in that way, their context would appear to be complicated, even
							ambiguous, and thus not simply productive in the reader's mind of a countering deflation. For Mary Shelley the most
							immediate resonance would be of a work written during the same summer in which Frankenstein was begun, Byron's Childe
							Harold's Pilgrimage, Canto 3. Stanza 70 of that poem contrasts the solitary Romantic impulse with the debilitating
							contentions of society denounced in its opening lines.</p>
						<p> There, in a moment, we may plunge our years<lb/> In fatal penitence, and in the blight<lb/> Of our own soul turn all our
							blood to tears,<lb/> And colour things to come with hues of Night;<lb/> The race of life becomes a hopeless flight<lb/> To
							those that walk in darkness: on the sea,<lb/> The boldest steer but where their ports invite,<lb/> But there are wanderers
							o'er Eternity<lb/> Whose bark drives on and on, and anchor'd ne'er shall be.</p>
						<p> This honoring of infinite mental freedom is of a piece with the thrust of major texts of European Romanticism, from
							Goethe's Faust to Wordsworth's Prelude, and nowhere moreso than in Byron's celebration of the artist's endeavors
							throughout his mature verse. Byron, however, is well aware—indeed, fashions Childe Harold's Pilgrimage around the
							supposition—that the rootless searcher for an infinitely receding ideal has an inverse double, which earlier in Canto III
							he had specifically demarcated, calling his antihero Harold "The wandering outlaw of his own dark mind" (III.20). </p>
						<p> As these terms might suggest and as his knowing quotation of Paradise Lost in Stanza 70 indicates, Byron is himself
							deliberately playing against an archetype he would expect his readers immediately to recognize. It is Satan's cohort
							Belial who ironically pays fulsome tribute to divine wandering, which is to say, the angelic intellectual inquiry he has
							unknowingly forfeited with his fall:</p>
						<p>     for who would lose,<lb/> Though full of pain, this intellectual being,<lb/> Those thoughts that wander through
							eternity,<lb/> To perish rather, swallowed up and lost<lb/> In the wide womb of uncreated Night,<lb/> Devoid of sense and
							motion?<lb/> -- II.146-51.</p>
						<p>Throughout the second book of his epic Milton plays upon the idea of wandering, equating it with the lost condition of all
							the Satanic legions. After Satan leaves Hell to scout out the new world, they are depicted as wholly unsettled in their
							new home:</p>
						<p>     the ranged Powers<lb/> Disband; and, wandering, each his several way<lb/> Pursues, as inclination or sad choice<lb/>
							Leads him perplexed, where he may likeliest find<lb/> Truce to his restless thoughts . . .<lb/> -- II.522-26</p>
						<p>As one group of fallen angels retires into philosophical discussion, they find their once divine assurance replaced by a
							fundamental uncertainty, expressed as "wandering mazes" of the mind.</p>
						<p>Others apart sat on a hill retired,<lb/> In thoughts more elevate, and reasoned high<lb/> Of Providence, Foreknowledge,
							Will, and Fate—<lb/> Fixed fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,<lb/> And found no end, in wandering mazes lost.<lb/>
							Of good and evil much they argued then,<lb/> Of happiness and final misery,<lb/> Passion and apathy, and glory and
							shame:<lb/> Vain wisdom all, and false philosophy!—<lb/> -- II.557-65</p>
						<p>In the meantime, their epitome Satan, reaching the gates of hell, confronts his daughter Sin and describes himself as on a
							"wandering quest" (II.830) across space in search of the newly created earth. Then, breaking out of hell and encountering
							the surrounding realm of Chaos, he again characterizes himself as "Wandering this darksome desert" (II.973). Satan's
							self-portrait may thus be seen to complete this series of references that connect the "wanderers o'er Eternity" celebrated
							by Byron and Belial with the darker Byronic avatar, the essentially Satanic "wandering outlaw of his own dark mind."
							Knowledgeable readers of Paradise Lost (and Mary Shelley proves herself such through out this novel's engagement with that
							prior text) might want, however, to recall the terms of its very end, where Adam and Eve depart Paradise "with wandering
							steps and slow" (XII.648), reminding us of how closely implicated in the idea of a fallen universe is the human condition
							we share with our mythic forebears.</p>
						<p>Of course, Mary Shelley's novel can stand on its own independent of such an elaborate literary cross-referencing. When we
							finally hear from Victor Frankenstein of the vicissitudes and despondency he has experienced in his arctic wanderings
							(III:7:21), we will have another, more immediately ironic context against which to view Walton's enthusiastic apostrophe
							to his new friend. </p>

					<item n="158">
						<term>domestic affections</term>
						<p>This phrase carries rich connotations in Mary Shelley's time. The Domestic Affections, for instance, is the title of the
							first mature volume of poetry by Felicia Hemans (1812), a volume in which she first laid claim to speak as the central
							female voice of the nineteenth-century bourgeoisie. The mythos of the enclosed domestic space presided over by the "Angel
							of the House" had a compelling power for the new order that came into place after the defeat of Napoleon. Quietly, in the
							first two chapters of this novel, Mary Shelley has inscribed it as a nurturing space for the growth of the Frankenstein
							children and even for their neighbor Henry Clerval. A similar enclosed circle animated by the "domestic affections" will
							form the nuclear center of the Creature's narrative in the second volume. Much critical literature has concentrated on
							these seeming ideals, some seeing a counter to the male Romantic quest, some questioning just how far Mary Shelley
							actually goes in endorsing them. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="159">
						<term>the amiableness of domestic affection</term>
						<p>Although no reader of Frankenstein, if asked to list its chief concerns, would be likely to narrow the range to the value
							of domesticity and virtue, we can discern in this emphasis a veiled attempt to steer potential critics away from an attack
							on the novel's political or religious implications. At the same time, the domestic affections are certainly of import for
							the novel, yet like many other themes encountered in its progressive development, their value becomes increasingly
							ambiguous.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="160">
						<term>our domestic circle</term>
						<p>The repetition of this phrase (I:1:13 and note) calls attention to what would appear an ideal family: close-knit,
							affectionate, mutually acculturating. Does it do so to establish such an ideal as a retreat from the sublime terrors of
							the novel? or to suggest that even such a model family could not be protected from ruination? or, with an underlying sense
							of irony, to stress that for all his nostalgia Victor never inculcated the values he honors as projected by the family?
							Similar questions surround the other "ideal" domestic scene of the novel, the De Laceys' cottage (II:3:15).</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="161">
						<term>our domestic circle</term>
						<p>Here Mary Shelley introduces another theme that will continually surface through the course of the novel, what Percy Bysshe
							Shelley in his preface to the first edition termed "the amiableness of domestic affection" (I:Pref:3). Later, when Victor
							must confront how far as a student he strayed from bring content in his family circle, he will inveigh against his folly
							and even link it politically to the imperialistic exploitation of unoffending innocent peoples (I:3:12). As with a number
							of elements in this novel, however, the further one pursues the central value of the domestic affections in Frankenstein,
							the more ambivalent appears their representation. For example, there is no small irony in the fact that what makes Victor
							Frankenstein and Robert Walton interesting as characters and helps to bond their friendship is their inability to find
							satisfaction within such narrow limits of endeavor. And the same might be said in 1816 for the unsanctioned alliance of
							Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin and Percy Bysshe Shelley.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="162">
						<term>doomed by slavery to toil in the mines</term>
						<p>A prime example of what Blake, in "London," called "mind-forg'd manacles." Victor's emblem for himself reveals at once his

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="163">
						<term>drawing</term>
						<p>Drawing was a customary component of a standard gentlewoman's education in the late eighteenth century: cf. Mary
							Wollstonecraft's Vindication, Chapter 12. The oddity of its being here singled out as Elizabeth's concern is that it was
							not a component of Mary Shelley's Godwinian education. On the other hand, perhaps we are to understand that this is Victor
							speaking, not Mary Shelley. This, then, could be another aspect of the inherently sexist categorizing in which he engages.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="164">
						<term>dreaded spectre</term>
						<p>The phrase demonizes the Creature, lending him the aura of an otherworldly existence. The overwrought language of this
							paragraph, appropriate as it may be to Victor's hysterical condition, is one of the few times in the novel where Mary
							Shelley indulges in the stock properties of the Gothic. By its melodramatic indulgence it testifies, if only in contrast,
							to the general stylistic restraint with which Mary Shelley vests her novel.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="165">
						<term>duties</term>
						<p>Emphasized here and twice repeated in the succeeding paragraph, the notion of duty will assume a problematic but highly
							important position throughout Frankenstein. Its characters are repeatedly cited in terms of the obligations for which they
							are held responsible, and on occasion they even find themselves confronted with a disturbing conflict when multiple duties
							interact or appear to contradict one another.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="166">
						<term>duties</term>
						<p>Suddenly Elizabeth has her gender role thrust upon her, and the reader cannot but be conscious that it is a subordinate

						<term>Duvillard</term>
						<p>In Geneva Mary Shelley hired a local nursemaid for her son William named Louise Duvillard, who would remain with the

							and this rich banker her second. To some extent Justine Moritz may be modeled on her.</p>

					<item n="169">
						<term>It was a divine spring</term>
						<p>Victor has been laid up by his illness for some five to six months and feels himself reborn by the season. In the meantime,

					</item>
					<item n="170">

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="171">
						<term>self-educated</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley is so insistent on this point that she has Walton repeat it to Victor Frankenstein (I:L4:6), whose formal
							education, by contrast, is extensive. It could be that she is trying to make a point about the primacy of moral education
							or the essential importance, in a novelistic tradition one associates with Henry Fielding, of a good heart. But it is more
							likely that she is establishing a perspective by which to engage larger questions concerning the means and ends of
							education. Victor Frankenstein's Creature is also self-educated and likewise has his identity strongly molded by what he
							happens to read.</p>

						<term>eight feet in height</term>
						<p>Victor's admission of his arbitrarily foolish decision would be almost comic did it not subsume such tragic consequences.
							In his very hubris over the "creation of a human being," Victor unthinkingly excludes the being from a humanity that is
							defined by its dependence on shared characteristics, alienating him in advance through a structural flaw of design. For
							all his preoccupation with the destiny he thinks controls his own life, Victor seems quite unconscious of how wholly his
							assumption of the role of God will determine the course of this being's existence. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="174">
						<term>Electricity</term>
						<p>Although Mary Shelley finesses the scientific instrumentation of her novel—and she could hardly do otherwise in allowing
							Victor to overstep the known boundaries of science—in this scene she clearly prepares us to understand that the dynamic
							secret of life Victor will discover is intimately connected to electricity as a "vital fluid." Her use of the term "spark
							of being" at the point of the Creature's coming into existence (I:4:1) seems intended to follow through on this
							conceptualization.</p>

					<item n="176">
						<term>Elizabeth Lavenza</term>
						<p>In the 1831 edition Elizabeth Lavenza's consanguinity with Victor Frankenstein has been removed: she is no longer his
							cousin. She is also no longer compared by simile to an insect, a bird, and a pet animal. Yet, Mary Shelley does retain the
							curiously dehumanizing figuration of the first edition by having Victor now compare her to a chamois.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="177">
						<term>Elizabeth Lavenza</term>
						<p>No critic has ever traced a protoype of the Lavenza surname, which is, in any event, a highly uncommon one. More
							immediately problematic to the reader, however, is the figurative imagery elaborated in this paragraph, which in its
							comparisons to an insect, a bird, and a pet animal, implicitly dehumanizes Elizabeth. It is possible, though the textual
							support is equivocal, that Mary Shelley intends this diction to be less laudatory of Elizabeth than self-referential, in
							terms of his facile sexism, of Victor's character.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="178">
						<term>my person had become emaciated with confinement</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley underscores the perfect irony of Victor's growing increasingly death-like as he attempts to impart life to a
							new being. Similarly, in his attempt to liberate that being from death into the freedom of life, he voluntarily commits
							himself to a prison of his own making.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="179">
						<term>a palpable enemy</term>
						<p>Victor's diction here reflects experiences to which we as readers have yet to become privy, experiences that have forced
							upon him a psychological condition that conceives of the world in terms of adversarial struggle. This is an example of the
							shrewd linguistic forecasting that we find everywhere in the early chapters of Mary Shelley's revised 1831 text. In this
							case we are alerted to how much those experiences have warped Victor's notion of reality into a series of antagonistic
							states. The "palpable enemy," which is here figured in spiritual terms, will become objectified in the Creature that he
							unleashes upon the world and who becomes dangerous precisely because he is treated as an enemy. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="180">

					</item>
					<item n="181">
						<term>the working of some powerful engine</term>
						<p>Inevitably, language like this calls to mind the, by now, obligatory laboratory equipment so characteristic of cinematic
							versions of the novel. That is all the more reason, then, for us to recognize that Mary Shelley is deliberately evoking
							not mere instrumentation but rather what we would now call a dynamo to infuse the creature with what she called at the
							close of the previous paragraph "vital warmth." Since the first successful electric generators were demonstrated only in
							the 1860s, Mary Shelley's vagueness ("some") reflects her sense that such an engine is a necessary technological
							development of current scientific knowledge but has not yet been invented. </p>

							Elizabeth stands by helpless to assuage the inherent biases of class.</p>
						<p>Mary Shelley's independent comments on the character of servants in republican Switzerland are contained in a letter of 1

						<p> The seemingly admirable discipline by which Walton defers fulfillment and prepares himself for the challenge of his

							self-denial into which Victor Frankenstein throws himself as he pursues his own ambitious project. Furthermore, the phrase
							itself, though seemingly innocent of allusive force, in the context provided by the diction of the ensuing paragraph takes
							on a mythological resonance. In the first book of Paradise Lost Satan, upon discovering himself on the floor of hell,
							discerns next to him Beelzebub, his associate in what he terms the "glorious enterprise" of the revolt against God:</p>
						<p>                          he whom mutual league, <lb/> United thoughts and counsels, equal hope <lb/> And hazard in the

					</item>
					<item n="184">

						<p>As in Walton's first letter (I:L1:5 and note) this may seem an innocent enough term, but accentuated through repetition

							echo of Satan's first speech in Paradise Lost is unmistakeable.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="185">
						<term>He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger</term>
						<p>There is no explanation for why Mary Shelley remakes Henry Clerval in so robust an athletic mode, replacing the dreamy,
							poetical (and Shelleyan) figure of the first edition. Perhaps it is Victor who renders the substitution, mindful of
							Walton's commitment to "enterprise," a word that, starting with the first sentence of the novel (1831:I:L1:1), he uses six
							times in his initial letters to his sister (see also 1831:I:L1:5, 1831:I:L2:1, 1831:I:L2:3 twice, and 1831:I:L4:20). (A
							context in Milton's Paradise Lost is noted in the latter.) Admittedly, it requires some stretching of the imagination and
							the text to force a Satanic context upon Henry Clerval: it may well be that by 1831 the original contextual referents for
							Mary Shelley have diminished or have been replaced by new emphases, in this case that of masculine heroism—the ardour so
							repetitiously invoked by her male protagonists. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="186">
						<term>scope for his spirit of enterprise</term>
						<p>This addition to the 1831 text is prepared for by a similar ambition stressed in Henry's youth (see 1831:I:2:2 and note)
							and may be generally accounted for by the importance the intervening decade and a half had attached to the growing eastern
							empire of Great Britain, not just in India but also in Afghanistan, on the edge of the Ottoman empire. It would have not
							seemed questionable to the author or her readers in 1831 that Henry Clerval would wish to distinguish himself as an
							imperialist. Mary Shelley would have been well aware that one of her former husband's closest friends, Thomas Love
							Peacock, though sharing Victor Frankenstein's privileging of the European classical tradition over "oriental" literature,
							had carved out a career in the East Indian Office, the bureaucracy that oversaw commerce with the imperial East. </p>

					<item n="188">
						<term>enthusiasm of success</term>
						<p>The coupling of "enthusiasm" and "ardent" in this paragraph seems to indicate an intention on Mary Shelley's part to
							underscore how associated are the two and how problematic they may be in that association. The two notions have already
							been mentioned in proximity in the previous letter (I:L1:2) and (I:L1:3). They will once again be linked in contiguous
							paragraphs by Victor Frankenstein, when he recounts the frenzied rush of discovery that accompanied his search for the
							secret of life (I:3:6 and I:3:8).</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="189">
						<term>enthusiasm</term>
						<p>Like "ardent curiosity" in the previous paragraph (I:L1:2), "enthusiasm" bears a double sense, both good and bad,
							throughout the novel. It will be taken over by Victor Frankenstein, who is gripped as a student by what he calls "an
							almost supernatural enthusiasm" (I:3:3), which he likens to the force of a hurricane (I:3:8). In the retrospect of years
							and their incumbent disasters he terms it first an enthusiastic frenzy (III:2:21) and, more starkly in the last moments of
							his existence, an enthusiastic madness (III:WC:28).</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="190">
						<term>enthusiasm</term>
						<p>As in Walton's first letter (I:L1:3) enthusiasm is a charged word. In this period it was as often a pejorative as an
							honorific word: fanatics of whatever stripe were said to be enthusiastic. This was particularly true of religious fanatics
							and self-proclaimed prophets. Such figures claimed to be directly inspired by God, to feel the presence of God within
							(which is the root meaning of the word in Greek). In an ironic twist on this meaning Mary Shelley presents Victor as a
							self-styled Ezekiel, wrought up not by a storm sent by God but in a mental hurricane of his own making as he endeavors to
							usurp the function of the deity.</p>
						<p>Johnson's 1755 Dictionary is highly suggestive in its implicit aversion to the idea of enthusiasm, defining it thus:</p>
						<p> 1. A vain belief of private revelation; a vain confidence of divine favour or communication.<lb/> 2. Heat of imagination;
							violence of passion; confidence of opinion.<lb/> 3. Elevation of fancy; exaltation of ideas.</p>
						<p>If anything, Johnson is even more severe on the practitioner than on the concept, defining an enthuasist as:</p>
						<p> 1. One who vainly imagines a private revelation; one who has a vain confidence of his intercourse with God.<lb/> 2. One of
							a hot imagination, or violent passions.<lb/> 3. One of elevated fancy, or exalted ideas.</p>
						<p>In, as it were, burying his third definition beneath the others, Johnson implies that such exaltation is spurious,
							ungrounded in reality. His dismissive "hot imagination" might similarly be taken as a synonymn for the "ardour" so
							conspicuously shared and honored by the protagonists of the novel. Quite clearly, the repeated use of "vain" and "vainly"
							is intended by Johnson to remind us of their substantive, which is "vanity." </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="191">
						<term>enthusiasm</term>
						<p>Walton's "romantic" instincts, he realizes, are affecting his judgment. His language recalls his earlier self-analysis
							(I:L2:2), suggesting that what he would need in a friend like Victor Frankenstein is exactly the ability to curb such
							flights of fancy. In the next paragraph Victor will decide to perform that function, starting in on the narration of his
							career as a corrective and an admonition.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="192">
						<term>LETTER</term>
						<p>Frankenstein is written in the mode of the epistolary novel, a form popularized in the eighteenth century by Samuel
							Richardson in his novels Pamela (1741) and Clarissa (1748) and expanded across class and social demarcations by Tobias
							Smollett in The Expedition of Humphrey Clinker. By the nineteenth century the epistolary form was something of an antique,
							its dynamics having largely been subsumed by other first-person narrative modes that allowed their authors greater
							flexibility. Mary Shelley's novel, which overtly advertises its modernity in a subtitle, is curiously, then, the last
							major example of the form in English fiction. The epistolary mode inherently stresses communication and process, major
							thematic concerns of the novel, and it accentuates a reliance on a variety of self-conscious narrators who are not easily
							subject to interrogation by one another nor the reader. Mary Shelley's stress on individual perspective and on its
							resulting narrative indeterminacy are conspicuous features of her novel.</p>
						<p>It is interesting to contemplate the fact that a principal account of William Parry's Arctic expedition of 1819, Letters
							Written during the Late Voyage of Discovery in the Western Arctic Sea (1821), is also couched in an epistolary form. This
							might indicate some of the same thematic associations, structurally speaking, that the form held for Mary Shelley, or,
							more immediately, it could reveal her sudden and striking influence on subsequent travel narratives into inaccessible
							reaches of the globe. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>

						<term>equal interest and utility</term>
						<p>That the inveterate Roman collector of superstitious lore could be thought by Victor to be as useful for the modern student

							that the level of this youth's scientific conceptions has yet to mature. In the next chapter he will embark upon his
							advanced education as an enthusiastic greenhorn.</p>

					<item n="194">
						<term>Ernest</term>
						<p>In revising her novel Mary Shelley totally changed Ernest's state of health but added nothing that would give him a reason
							for existing in the novel except to carry on the family name in obscurity. In both texts, however, Ernest serves as a foil
							to the overly abstract and abstracted mind of his brother Victor. As a farmer (1818) or a mercenary keeper of the peace
							(1831), Ernest's concern would be with the given order of things rather than with what underlies it conceptually. In both
							texts (but paradoxically more pronounced in the third edition, many years after Byron provided an immediate context for
							her writing), Ernest bears a striking similarity to the Chamois Hunter of Manfred, which Byron began after the Shelleys'
							departure in 1816 and is also set in Switzerland. See Act I, scene ii, and Act II, scene i.</p>

					<item n="196">

						<p>Ernest is at this juncture in his seventeenth year, the same age that Victor was when he left his home to study in

					<item n="197">
						<term>even now she often reminds me of her</term>
						<p>This point is reemphasized two paragraphs on. Given the events subsequent to this chapter, one should stress the
							significance of this statement. Justine Moritz has been so fond of Victor's mother Caroline that she imitates her tones
							and gestures and to Elizabeth seems like her embodiment. That Victor can remain silent at her persecution will thus be a
							signal moral failing.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="198">
						<term>Excellent friend</term>
						<p>We will learn the reason for this rhetorical heightening through the vocative case as we move into the next chapter. This
							is the last serene moment that Victor will experience in his entire existence, but the address to Clerval in the past
							tense immediately shadows its expression of joy. In retrospect, the reader may consider Victor's happiness during this
							year as purchased by a willful blindness to the potential consequences of his actions.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="199">
						<term>to shelter her, as a fair exotic</term>
						<p>An exotic Johnson, in his 1755 Dictionary, defines simply as "A foreign plant." In modern parlance it would designate a
							tropical, or non-hardy, botanical specimen. As the succeeding sentences suggest, Caroline Frankenstein's fragile health,
							which will lead to her early death, justifies such care. Today's reader is likely to find such language offensive since
							intrinsically patronizing, but it was a common occurence in the fiction, and the society, of Mary Shelley's day and would
							have drawn no particular attention to itself. Yet, since gender roles are of continuing significance in the development of
							the novel, this early emphasis on the traditional frailty of the female physique is noteworthy.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="200">
						<term>extensive usefulness</term>
						<p>Victor's account of his life, we should recall, begins with the pedigree of the male Frankensteins in the public life of
							the state (I:1:1). In his youth he was clearly inculcated with his obligation to follow in this family tradition. The
							issue bears as well for Walton's sense of purpose on his expedition (I:L1:2).</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="201">
						<term>with my eyes fixed on a coach</term>
						<p>This strange intensity of gaze seems to combine the fixated obsessiveness in which Victor has passed the previous two years

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="202">
						<term>my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature</term>
						<p>Victor is originally described by Walton as having a powerful feeling for nature (I:L4:28), which is certainly not the case
							here; nor is it, indeed, at many crucial points in his narrative. Although in this novel turning away from nature may be
							indicative of a moral lapse, it is true that in the present instance Victor is circumventing nature in his creation of
							another sentient being. Thus, it might be said that his insensitivity to the natural is perfectly in keeping with his
							commitment to a creative act independent of its limitations.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="203">
						<term>fainted</term>
						<p>Walton understandably credits Victor's condition to severe exposure; but Victor tends to react with extreme stress to the
							Creature's presence and more than once falls into a catatonic state: e.g., after the Creature's original escape (I:4:3),
							after the destruction of the second creature (III:3:24), and after the death of Clerval (III:4:10). This appears to be a

						<term>the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy</term>
						<p>The diction here is deliberately resonant with the conventions of a highly artificial poetry. The "fair enemy" is the lady
							to whom these seductive verses would be addressed, an "enemy" in the sense that she resists their appeal to abandon
							herself to the sensuousness they invite. </p>
						<p/>

					<item n="205">
						<term>fairy tale</term>
						<p>Although Charles Perrault (1628-1703) is firmly a citizen of the seventeenth century, his Contes des fees, popularly known
							as Mother Goose Stories, had by late in the eighteenth century become staples of children's literature and had prompted
							many imitations. William Lane of the Minerva Press in London, publisher of numerous fictional pot-boilers, for instance,
							also brought out two-volume sets of fairy tales in 1788 and 1794. Closer to home, Mary Shelley's father, William Godwin,
							under his psuedonym of Edward Baldwin, in 1805 published a set of Fables Ancient and Modern for very young children that
							went through numerous editions; and the Juvenile Library, which he ran with his second wife Mary Jane Clairmont,
							specialized in children's books with useful morality appended. This series published the first English translation of
							Johann David Wyss's perennial Swiss Family Robinson in 1814. Mary Shelley was thus as a child uniquely conditioned by
							contemporary notions of children's literature, and she was also encouraged to become a writer at a very young age. The
							careful noting of Clerval's age (9) when he wrote his fairy tale indicates that Mary Shelley has in mind her own debut at
							the age of 11, in a satirical parody about an Englishman in France, Mounseer Nongtongpaw, that was published in January
							1807.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="206">
						<term>fangs of remorse</term>
						<p>With this phrase Mary Shelley insinuates a theme into her novel that will develop exponentially over its course. We recall
							that Victor expressed "the greatest remorse" for having kept Henry Clerval from his studies during his long illness
							(I:4:20): that diction, for all its hyperbole, was utterly conventional. Now, Victor is bitten by remorse as by a
							poisonous viper, and it will poison his system for the rest of his existence. For the later course of this poison where it
							results in agony, for instance, see the last sentence of III:5:8. This same poison infects the Creature as well, he
							bitterly admits to Walton (III:WC:37). The contemporary definition of remorse accentuated so painful a condition.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="207">
						<term>somewhat fastidious</term>
						<p>This may appear a surprising choice of diction on Walton's part. Johnson's Dictionary defines the word pejoratively:</p>
						<p> Disdainful; squeamish; delicate to a vice; insolently nice.</p>
						<p>The Oxford English Dictionary somewhat refines the range of possible meanings:</p>
						<p> 1. That creates disgust; disagreeable, distasteful, unpleasant, wearisome. Obs.<lb/> 2.<lb/>    -- a. That feels or is
							full of disgust; disgusted.<lb/>    -- b. Full of pride; disdainful; scornful. Obs.<lb/>    -- c. transf. Of things:
							'Proud', magnificent.<lb/> 3. Easily disgusted, squeamish, over-nice; difficult to please with regard to matters of taste
							or propriety.</p>
						<p>The connotation of Walton's usage indicates that he is using the word in the third sense here, suggestive of a
							well-educated and highly refined sense of taste.</p>
						<p>What may be most interesting about this sentence is what it says about Mary Shelley's values. A woman who has been "tutored
							and refined by books" is still an uncommon being in eighteenth-century culture, often referred to contemptuously as a
							"learned lady." Here, in contrast, Margaret Saville is a paragon of judgment and the conduit through which this entire
							history, with its multiple internal narratives, flows. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="208">
						<term>fatal impulse</term>
						<p>It is probably no accident that Victor employs diction that could also be used to describe a massive jolt of electric
							current. His Creature will receive such a "fatal impulse" at the beginning of the fourth chapter (I:4:1), when Victor
							"infuse[s] a spark of being" into its flesh. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="209">
						<term>fate</term>
						<p>Victor uses the term with a wholly different emphasis from that given to it by Walton in the previous paragraph. Walton's
							wish to "ameliorate his fate" refers to the despondency to which he thinks Victor has been driven by hard, but as yet
							undiscriminated, circumstances, a despondency that could be alleviated by time and compassion. Victor, on the other hand,
							as his narrative will begin to underscore, has come to see himself as a destined victim of these circumstances, one who
							can neither alter them nor their effect on his own condition. The disparity in usage is actually a window into character. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="210">
						<term>the words of fate</term>
						<p>As Victor underscores his sense of being wholly out of control of his destiny, he also suggests that, at least as a
							student, he had little knowledge of himself. At Ingolstadt he finds himself transformed before his own eyes, without an
							understanding of how or why this process should have happened. The lack of knowledge, of which he has just complained to
							Walton, thus extends far beyond the rudiments of science.</p>

						<term>felt not as I did, such deep and bitter agony</term>
						<p>As earlier at the trial (I:7:11), Victor's egocentricity impels him to assert his prior claim as sufferer, even as he
							stands in the presence of the condemned innocent. His grounds seem to be that Justine, although surely a victim of
							injustice, has the integrity of her innocence to depend upon, whereas he, although powerless to alter the verdict, knows

						<p>God is the final cause, and Mary Shelley would have been well aware that a great many people in England could purport to

							last years wrote a two-volume commentary on the Book of Revelation, where the final cause, in the conventional teaching of
							Christianity, is cryptically revealed. The secondary and tertiary grades of causation would be, for example, the rationale
							behind the laws of the universe enunciated with such clarity by Isaac Newton. An example closer to the fictional point
							would be to understand why and how the Grand Unified Field operates, since both Victor Frankenstein and Robert Walton have
							been engaged in trying to fathom isolated aspects of it. See I:L1:2 and note.</p>

						<p>Mary Shelley here unobtrusively introduces another key concern of the novel, often invoked as "destiny," that broadly

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="218">
						<term>forced to destroy</term>
						<p>The language of necessity here is curious and seems indicative of Victor's almost instinctive recourse to a sense of

							preceding paragraph, and equally heretical.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="219">
						<term>such evil forebodings</term>
						<p>This is a first indication that women and men do not generally see eye to eye in this novel. It will be replicated in

							domestic tranquillity over which women conventionally preside is threatened by the sublime overreaching of male ambition.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="220">
						<term>An open and capacious forehead</term>
						<p>It would appear once more that Victor has read and inculcated the wisdom of one of his most celebrated countrymen in the
							eighteenth century, Johann Kaspar Lavater (1741-1801), whose Physiognomische Fragmente (1775-1778)—translated into English
							in 1789-1798 as Essays on Physiognomy— purported to show how character could be inferred from facial features and
							proportions. Here "open" carries moral connotations, indicative of the "frankness of disposition" with which this sentence
							ends. See I:3:1 and note for an earlier instance where physiognomy appears to enter into his discourse.</p>
						<p>Mary Shelley was aware that her own character had been predicted from her infant physiognomy by her father's close friend,
							the scientist William Nicholson.</p>
						<p>Nicholson (1753-1815), from an initial meeting in 1786, became one of William Godwin's closest friends, a major influence
							on the conception of his Enquiry concerning Political Justice, and his source during more than a quarter-century for
							up-to-date knowledge in the sciences. He and his wife were among the most attentive of friends during the fatal illness of
							Mary Wollstonecraft. On the infant Mary Godwin's nineteenth day, Godwin persuaded Nicholson to write a lengthy prediction
							of his daughter's character based on her physiognomy, according to the system popularized by Lavater.</p>
						<p>Nicholson's most important contribution to chemistry was the discovery of the process of electrolysis of water, using the
							new advances in electricity developed by Alessandro Volta and others. He discovered that the application of electrical
							currents to water causes the water to break into its component elements, hydrogen and oxygen — the first chemical reaction
							produced by electricity.</p>
						<p>In addition to being a practicing chemist, Nicholson was instrumental in propagating knowledge in the field. His
							introduction to Natural Philosophy (1781) was widely known. He founded The Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and
							the Arts in 1797, the first scientific journal not under the aegis of a scientific institution. And in 1809, he published
							the British Encyclopedia; or, Dictionary of arts and sciences. Comprising an accurate and popular view of the present
							improved state of human knowledge in six volumes, from which the extracts concerning galvanic experimentation in the first
							decade of the nineteenth century, a process of which he was among the major exponents, are invaluable. This consolidation
							of the contemporary scientific scene has long been understood to have been instrumental in making Percy Bysshe Shelley "a
							Newton among poets." What should be equally clear is that the acquaintance of Mary Shelley with this remarkable man, thus
							begun in infancy, would have amply provided her with a theoretical understanding of the scientific bases on which her
							novel purports to rest.</p>
						<p>As Nicholson's account emphasizes (C. Kegan Paul, William Godwin: His Friends and Contemporaries (London, 1876), pp.
							289-90), she, too, possessed a "capacious forehead." </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="221">
						<term>forgetful of herself</term>
						<p>This feminine ideal stands in sharp contrast to the masculine pursuit of glory (I:L1:6, I:1:18), and, as marked here, it
							will continue to resonate through the course of the novel. In some sense the theme has already been signalled in Walton's
							attendance on the exhausted Victor Frankenstein (I:L4:10).</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="222">
						<term>frankly</term>
						<p>Candor is an important character trait in the novel, and it is to Walton's credit that he so naturally evinces it. His
							openness will elicit a similar frankness from Victor Frankenstein, who for the first time in his existence will tell his
							entire story. But that narration, then, raises a serious problem. Not only are there many signs of instability in it, the
							major one being Victor's wish to revise it even as it goes along (III:WC:4 and note); but his earlier lack of candor with
							his family and friends is akin to dishonesty, which, if so common a practice throughout his mature life, must raise
							serious doubts about the truthfulness of the narration that comprises the bulk of this novel.</p>

						<term>I have no friend</term>
						<p>The first embarkation on a major and, to some critics, puzzling feature of this novel, its all but exclusive emphasis on
							male bonding.</p>
						<p>If we consider novels that are contemporary with Frankenstein and have been accorded a similar canonical reputation, we
							might expect a woman novelist to emphasize the richness of female relationships (for instance, the sisters of Austen's
							Sense and Sensibility or Pride and Prejudice) and a man (the classic example might be Walter Scott in Ivanhoe) to
							concentrate on the representation of male competition and loyalties.</p>
						<p>Perhaps, however, we are overly conditioned by stereotypes. On the one hand, there is the fact that Frankenstein was
							published anonymously and was taken by at least one critic, Walter Scott himself, to be the work of a male author (see his
							review in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine). From this it could be argued that Mary Shelley might have wished to escape the
							preoccupation with female experience in contemporary "lady novelists." And on the other hand, from a feminist perspective
							it could likewise be argued that a women might have a very different take on that male competition and loyalty than a man.
							Inasmuch as masculine terms might be said to define the boundaries of a woman's existence, Mary Shelley might have thought
							an exclusionary male experience to be a province to which she had every right to demand access. This would have been
							particularly the case in 1816, after nearly a quarter century of almost continuous warfare in Europe. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="225">
						<term>friend</term>
						<p>The novel reverts once more to the importance of male bonding, already developed in Victor's narrative in the warm
							relationship between Alphonse Frankenstein and his wife's father, M. Beaufort, represented in its second paragraph (I:1:2
							and note), and before that in the intimacy struck between Walton and Victor aboard ship (I:L4:24).</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="226">
						<term>Frightful must it be</term>
						<p>This sudden elevation of language should not be merely dismissed as a facile rhetorical heightening for effect. What Mary
							Shelley seems deliberately to be doing here is evoking a succession of elements and emotional states associated with the
							Sublime in eighteenth-century aesthetic theory. As the Creature in his coming to life is associated with the Sublime, so
							he is its avatar wherever he appears in the novel, either living within a sublime landscape (e.g. Mont Blanc or northern
							Siberia) or terrifying the human beings whom he encounters by his extra-human size and countenance.</p>

					<item n="227">
						<term>Frankenstein</term>
						<p>Over the years in which Mary Shelley's novel was transformed into the stuff of legend, much speculation has centered on
							where she might have encountered the name of her protagonist. Unfortunately, none of the suggestions has moved beyond the
							level of speculation.</p>
						<p> It is conceivable that she heard the name of a ruined castle on the Rhine during the hurried trip that she, her
							half-sister Claire Clairmont, and Percy Bysshe Shelley took down that river in returning to England from the 1814 trip she
							memorialized in A History of a Six Weeks' Tour, a trip also quickly replicated in the third volume of Frankenstein
							(III:1:16). But this is unlikely, since none of the party spoke German, and Mary represents them as being rather
							standoffish to their fellow passengers during the trip.</p>
						<p>Similarly, there is no documentary evidence of a visit to the Frankenstein Castle near Darmstadt. Indeed, had it happened,
							one would have expected it to have been noted either by P. B. Shelley in the Preface he wrote to the 1818 edition or by
							Mary Shelley herself in the retrospective history she penned for the Introduction in 1831. What the speculation has
							proven, however, is that the Frankenstein name is common enough not to have needed an actual prototype. The only real
							oddity about the family name, and one never broached in the text, is how so Germanic an appellation became attached to a
							French-speaking family in Switzerland. </p>

						<p>In this context Victor means a long passage-way, which was a feature of many older European residences. Such a gallery

						<term>galvanism had given token of such things</term>
						<p>Galvanism is named after the inventor of the electric cell, Luigi Galvani, professor of medicine at the University of

							by making the legs of dead frogs move as if with life. Galvani's nephew, Giovanni Aldini (1762-1834), conducted
							experiments in London recounted in John Aldini, An Account of the Late Improvements in Galvanism, with a series of curious
							and interesting experiments . . . [and an] Appendix, containing the author's Experiments on the body of a Malefactor
							executed at Newgate (London: Cuthell &amp; Martin and John Murray, 1803). In the first canto of Don Juan, written
							later in the year in which Frankenstein was published (1818), Byron remarks that "This is the age of oddities let loose"
							(line 1021), and comments on various scientific advances: </p>
						<p>Bread has been made (indifferent) from potatoes;<lb/>   And galvanism has set some corpses grinning. . . . <lb/> (I.1033-4) </p>

						<p>Trials were a form of spectator sport in the later eighteenth century, with criminals commonly being assaulted and

					<item n="232">
						<term>Geneva</term>
						<p>A city of about thirty thousand at the time of the novel, Geneva had long held an importance in central Europe
							incommensurate with its relatively modest size. John Calvin, arriving in this quiet city in 1536, transformed it into a
							center of the Reformation. In 1559, Calvin and Théodore de Bèze founded the University of Geneva to function as a center
							of Protestant intellectual inquiry. This orientation made a natural linkage between the University of Geneva and Oxford
							and Cambridge Universities in England that thrived throughout the later Renaissance.</p>
						<p>That early sense of kinship the English felt for the Swiss was reinforced during Mary Shelley's age by two factors. One was
							the invasion of this neutral, unoffending country by the French in 1798, which became a major focus of government
							propaganda in England and effectively ended all sympathy for the course of the French Revolution by its intellectual
							elite. The second, and for Mary Shelley a more immediate factor, was the inveterate hostility to Napoleon practiced by the
							leading citizen of Geneva's small suburb of Coppet, Germaine de Staël, who there surrounded herself with a significant
							circle of independent and generally democratic thinkers like A. W. Schlegel and J. C. L. Simonde de Sismondi. The daughter
							of one of the few untouchable supporters of the early revolution, Jacques Necker, who kept France financially afloat
							during its turbulent transition from monarchy to jacobin directory, Germaine de Staël was banned from France by Napoleon
							and through her travels enjoyed a pan-European renown. Byron met her in London in 1813, a year before his publisher John
							Murray brought out her important work On Germany.</p>
						<p>The circle surrounding Madame de Staël could be construed as an extension of the earlier source of independent intellectual
							energy provided by Geneva's most famous citizen in the eightenth century, Jean-Jacques Rousseau. During the 1816 summer,
							Byron and Shelley undertook a boat tour of the northern shore of Lake Geneva with the particular aim of visiting locations
							associated with Rousseau and his writings. Although Mary remained behind, she would have shared their enthusiasm for this
							last great figure of the French Enlightenment. It could not have been absent from her mind that to begin a first-person
							narrative account, "I am by birth a Genevese" (I:1:1) would automatically remind readers of Rousseau's Confessions, the
							fourth paragraph of which begins in a similar manner. Rousseau's spirit, indeed, might be said to hover over the entire
							novel, from its emphasis on a new "noble savage" to its concern with education, particularly in the formation of the
							Creature, to its antiestablishment political undertones.</p>
						<p>With such pronounced associations of relevance in both its past and recent history, Geneva stands as a perfect match for
							the other great center of the Enlightenment, St. Petersburg. As Chapter 1 issues, so to speak, from the voice of Victor
							Frankenstein identifying himself with the Swiss city, Letter 1 (I:L1:1) is dated by Robert Walton from the Russian
							capital. Together these figures and these cities represent the values of the Enlightenment that will be interrogated over
							and over in the subsequent pages of Mary Shelley's novel. </p>

						<p>If we can take this tribute at face value, as an honest assessment of the rehabilitation presided over by Henry Clerval, we
							must then read a tragic irony into Victor's expression here. He has opened himself up once more to the generous humanity
							he had experienced in his domestic circle, a humanity that might have enveloped his Creature in far different
							circumstances from those attending his instant rejection at Victor's hands. As with other sentiments in these last

						<p>In her revisions Mary Shelley somewhat mitigates the picture of institutional injustice so starkly presented in the first

							structure. The Justine of 1831 becomes much more conventionally pious and more tranquilly submissive to what she conceives
							to be the will of heaven.</p>
						<p>The reasons for this shift in tone may be many and complicated. One obvious one is that England was on the brink of the
							passage of the Great Reform Bill when her novel was republished in 1831, and the prelude to that sweeping legislation, the
							repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts in 1828, had opened an era of religious freedom and toleration in which such

						<p>William Godwin, 1756-1836, political philosopher and novelist, husband of Mary Wollstonecraft, and father of Mary Shelley.</p>
						<p>Godwin's works, including works of political philosophy (most importantly An Enquiry concerning Political Justice) and
							several novels (including Caleb Williams and St. Leon), advocate intellectual self-development through the rule of reason,
							personal freedom bordering on political anarchy, the dismantling of inherited institutions, religious liberalism, and
							disinterested justice.</p>
						<p>Political Justice emphasizes the deleterious impact of all systems of government on the ethical and intellectual
							development of individual human beings. In this systematically argued critique Godwin posits the ultimate perfectibility
							of mankind if freed from repressive social structures. In his novels Godwin obliquely underscores these same philosophical
							and social issues, adding to them a continuing gallery of portraits of male figures whose obsessions and self-regard are
							supported by the patriarchal institutions of modern civilization. Both his philosophical and fictional concerns are, in

						<p>Prussia and Austria would be the obvious surrounding context for Switzerland, but two sentences later the reader is given
							pre-revolutionary France and England as natural referents (and thus implicit allies), a sly but penetrating political
							thrust on Mary Shelley's part. The defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo had occured in June 1815, a little over a year before
							the novel was begun, and the "Holy Alliance" of autocracies had through the Congress of Vienna reinstated itself in firm

						<p>A heavy sea with large waves. Although they are still ice-bound, the sailors can hear the sound of waves breaking in the

					<item n="246">
						<term>the guardian angel of my life</term>
						<p>This seemingly strange shift in Victor's autobiography, without parallel in the account of his early education in the first
							edition, may be intended by Mary Shelley in her emendations to prepare us for, and make a logical link to, Victor's mental
							state just before he is rescued by Walton and his crew. In the last chapter of his narration (III:7:5) he accounts himself
							under the special protection of guiding spirits who guide his vengeance against the Creature.</p>
						<p>Coming as it does at the end of this chapter on his formative influence, this strong commitment to a guiding destiny
							testifies to a belief system through which Victor filters his entire existence, thus in effect rewriting it. Where a
							reader might wish to observe in Victor's behavior a normal adolescent lethargy or an understandable lack of assurance
							about the future course of his preparation for adulthood, Victor sees the hand of Providence. </p>

						<term>guest</term>
						<p>In the last paragraph of the preceding entry (I:L4:23), written eight days earlier, Victor had still been a "stranger."

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="248">
						<term>my want of a guide</term>
						<p>In her revisions Mary Shelley strengthens the similarities between Victor Frankenstein and Robert Walton. In this case,
							although Victor is about to undergo a systematic education, the 1831 text leaves him virtually as lacking in discipline as
							Walton represented himself to be in writing to his sister (1831:I:L1:2 and note). In the context provided by the terms of
							Walton's letter, where he remarks how much he needs a friend to help regulate his mind, Victor's lack of a close associate
							in these early weeks spent almost in solitude is ominous.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="249">
						<term>I was so guided by a silken cord</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley, though an only child, did not grow up like one, since there were four different parental configurations for
							the five children of the Godwin household. Yet, the venerated memory of her father's approach to her education is surely
							implicit in this "silken cord" by which Victor, led insensibly on for his own betterment, comes to enjoy his education. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="250">
						<term>had taken an irresistable hold of my imagination</term>
						<p>Once again, Victor yields his will to his passion. But the terms he uses seem to invoke something beyond the question of
							free will and determinism. Victor at this point recognizes that his imagination, the creative power of fantasy, is driving
							his pursuit of the unknown, which tends to implicate a faculty ordinarily privileged in British Romanticism. Something of
							the same order happened four paragraphs earlier, when the imagination was likewise cited (I:3:7).</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="251">
						<term>but half made up</term>
						<p>Given the erudition of her father and her husband, Mary Shelley would have known of Aristophanes' account, in Plato's
							Symposium, of the origin of love occuring when primitive man was split in two: thereafter one half was always yearning for
							the completion of the self in the other. (P. B. Shelley was to translate the Symposium in the spring of 1818.) Here she
							plays against the myth ironically, for, as we will see in the sequel, Victor Frankenstein and his Creature will pursue a
							course of adversarial antagonism that is as passionately intense as love. It is frequently figured in the imagery of
							doubling and mirroring.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="252">
						<term>heart and soul</term>
						<p>This is the second time (see also I:3:10) that Victor uses this phrase in the chapter to indicate the totality of his
							commitment to his program of research.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="253">
						<term>heartless laughter</term>
						<p>Like so much of the diction in this chapter the phrase can be read in two senses: first, as laughter without cause, as
							though Victor's heart is not in it; second, as a cold, self-obsessed, or unfeeling discharge of nervous energy. Although
							the first meaning is the natural way to construe the diction, the second remains behind, like a sour aftertaste, to affect
							our later judgments. It is allied to the intimation of madness expressed by the wildness of Victor's eyes.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="254">
						<term>heart-rending eloquence</term>
						<p>Both Elizabeth and Victor, endeavoring to alter the verdict through a rhetoric that would move the judges' hearts,
							completely fail in their attempt. Once again, eloquence is placed at the center of the discourse and in a highly
							problematic light. Why it is so problematic might best be gauged by comparing this work to the major poem that Percy
							Bysshe Shelley was writing simultaneously with it, The Revolt of Islam. There the heroine Cythna so moves the hearts of
							her auditors through her eloquent appeals to their common humanity as to foment a radical revolution that overthrows the
							tyranny that has oppressed them. Although it is a conspicuous feature of Cythna's presence, Canto 8 of that poem is
							exemplary since it is entirely devoted to this process.</p>
						<p>In the Shelleys' household, then, eloquence holds a privileged place as a tool of non-violent political reform. Where it
							fails so grievously as here, the consequences may be very great. That Mary Shelley is herself aware of this dimension may
							be inferred from her letter of June 1 1816 where she calmly notes of the French "liberation" of Switzerland in 1798 that
							all "the magistrates . . . were shot by the populace during that revolution." It may give the reader pause to realize that
							one of those actual magistrates, were he still himself among the living, would have been Alphonse Frankenstein. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="255">
						<term>he has retired into himself</term>
						<p>As with other of his comments in this passage, readers may sense that what Walton signifies is conceptually broader than
							what he actually realizes he is saying: thus the value of his comment is more in alerting us to a problematic issue than
							in giving us a thumbnail sketch that will define Victor Frankenstein forever in our minds. Where Walton sees a
							praiseworthy self-containment in his friend's comportment, indeed, many critics remark the dangers of Romantic solipsism.
							In Victor's own account his introversion and obsessiveness will be stressed as character traits that were factors
							contributing to his downfall.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="256">
						<term>become a hell</term>
						<p>As the Dante allusion in the previous paragraph suggests, hell is a mental state. Victor's words make a direct allusion to
							one of Milton's most famous passages in Paradise Lost, where Satan comes face to face with the responsibility for his own
							damnation:</p>
						<p>Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand?<lb/> Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse,<lb/> But Heaven's
							free love dealt equally to all?<lb/> Be then his love accursed, since love or hate,<lb/> To me alike, it deals eternal
							woe.<lb/> Nay, cursed be thou; since against his thy will<lb/> Chose freely what it now so justly rues.<lb/> Me miserable!
							which way shall I fly<lb/> Infinite wrath, and infinite despair?<lb/> Which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hell. . . . <lb/>

						<term>Henry Clerval</term>
						<p>In Percy Bysshe Shelley's first major poem, Queen Mab (1813), the male friend (and author-surrogate) who awaits the

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="258">
						<term>every one else believes in her guilt</term>
						<p>Although Victor's jumping to conclusions about the guilt of his Creature indicates how widespread is the temptation to
							judge without evidence, the fact that Justine has been convicted in the popular mind before her trial even starts
							introduces a sinister element to the social dimensions of the novel. The class issues that will arise in the trial are
							highly complicated. The small detail of how the Frankenstein family was circumvented by its own servants, who were the
							ones to appeal to the magistrates (see I:6:34), is telling in its representation of how widespread has been the process of
							scapegoating that has eventuated in Justine's arrest. This detail may also suggest that the Frankenstein family has itself
							attempted to keep faith with Justine and thus, in some sense, may serve to mitigate the reader's own temptation to rush to
							judgment over the family's complicity in an exercise of injustice.</p>

					<item n="259">
						<term>her mother could not endure her</term>
						<p>This is a curious imposition on Mary Shelley's novel and one that has raised eyebrows among critics with a biographical

							to her step-mother Mary Jane Clairmont Godwin.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="260">
						<term>my hideous progeny</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley has already used the word "hideous" four times in the Introduction to refer to both the being who was endowed
							with life in the novel and her own conception, "so very hideous an idea" (I:Intro:1). Here they are explicitly conflated.
							As this novel of horror is revised, so the Creature that inhabits and terrorizes it is reanimated.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="261">
						<term>high white steeple</term>
						<p>However much Mary Shelley may have known about Ingolstadt, she never visited the town and thus probably surmised from her
							general travels in Switzerland and Germany (or perhaps from her travels down the Rhine two years before in 1814) that it
							would have had such a steeple. The various towered constructions of Ingolstadt, however, are all built in brick. There is
							a wooden steeple-like construction atop the Hoheschule (University), but it would not have been visible from afar as a
							landmark.</p>

					</item>
					<item n="263">
						<term>his conversation was full of imagination</term>
						<p>Here, the invocation of imagination seems shadowed by no darker intimations, as it had been earlier (see I:3:7 and note;
							I:4:18 and note). But, in fact, the shadow has simply been postponed to the next chapter, where it looms with devastating
							effect, dispelling all this happiness as being as insubstantial as dreams.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="264">
						<term>his labours</term>
						<p>The pronoun is pointed, an attempt to shield Mary Shelley from an attack on her as a female novelist. Attenuating this
							strategy, Percy Bysshe Shelley himself undertook all negotiations for the publication of the novel. The subterfuge worked
							at least to some extent. Walter Scott, reviewing the novel in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine identified Shelley as the
							author. Closer to the local scene, the Quarterly, inimical to Godwin, savaged the novel as the production of his daughter.
							Perhaps, this was exactly why the subterfuge was undertaken in the first place.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="265">
						<term>his father</term>
						<p>The sense of divergent perspectives between Victor and Alphonse Frankenstein encountered in the first chapter
							(I:1:15-I:1:16) here is extended to a neighboring father's shortsighted thwarting of all his son's ambitions. Given
							Victor's portrayal of Clerval as a poet, it is impossible not to feel the impress of Percy Bysshe Shelley's strained
							relations with his father in this account.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="266">
						<term>horror of that countenance</term>
						<p>Throughout the novel, with the exception of Victor's interview with his Creature in Volume 2 (II:2:6), only the blind
							(II:7:16) or one who dissembles their condition (III:WC:35) can remain unperturbed in the presence of the Creature.</p>

						<term>how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge</term>

					<item n="268">
						<term>How sweet is the affection of others</term>
						<p>Sentimental as are Justine's remarks, it is important to realize how scrupulously they register such major themes of the
							novel as the value of domestic affections and of sympathy. Whether they do so to underscore the consolation they offer
							when all else fails or their inadequacy to assuage a fundamental injustice is the question Mary Shelley carefully leaves
							up in the air.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="269">
						<term>human benevolence</term>
						<p>Human benevolence, or natural goodness (the quality stressed in the revised language of the third edition), is an attribute
							believed in deeply by both Mary and Percy Bysshe Shelley. At the same time, it cannot simply be assumed as a given in
							Frankenstein, for it is severely tested by the chain of events driving this novel. Even people who are nominally
							benevolent (Victor is the obvious example), act with questionable ethics. And those who are most committed to the notion
							of a natural benevolence (Elizabeth, for instance) would be hard pressed to show any evidence for it.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="270">
						<term>the structure of the human frame</term>
						<p>Although the first sentence of the preface to the original edition, which points to Erasmus Darwin, has generally been
							thought to specify his Temple of Nature, Victor Frankenstein's scientific concern with animal structures might suggest the
							relevance to the novel as well of Darwin's Zoonomia; or, the Laws of Organic Life, published in two volumes in 1794 and
							1796. The first volume, in particular, broadly considers the function of structure throughout the faunal species.</p>

					<item n="271">
						<term>I certainly did not owe the suggestion of one incident</term>
						<p>A long critical history has sprung up around this statement. Now that all the extant manuscripts for the novel have been
							published in facsimile, it would appear, at least from the written evidence, that Mary Shelley's defence of her own
							artistry is accurate. Her husband read the manuscript with careful attention, here and there suggesting variations in
							phrasing that Mary Shelley incorporated into the final form of the novel. As the editor of the facsimile edition
							concludes, "A reading of the evidence in these Frankenstein Notebooks should make clear that PBS's contributions to
							Frankenstein were no more than what most publishers' editors have provided new (or old) authors or, in fact, what
							colleagues have provided to each other after reading each other's works in progress." For the full statement, see Charles
							E. Robinson, ed. The Frankenstein Notebooks: A Facsimile Edition (New York and London: Garland Publishing, 1996), I,

					<item n="272">
						<term>I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I was</term>
						<p>Here in an essential form is the crux of the similarity being subtly drawn between the conditions of Justine and the
							Creature. Not only has society cast her off as "guilty," but it has reinforced its verdict by classifying her as alien,
							beyond a human pale: thus, a "monster." Yet, since individual identity is itself so deeply subject to social construction,
							to find oneself termed alien is to undergo an immediate process of self-alienation. We will witness the same process as
							the driving force in the Creature's education as the next volume unfolds. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="273">
						<term>I am at length free</term>
						<p>The double entendre falls heavily, since from this point on until the end of his life Victor will be tied to his Creature
							with unbreakable bonds</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="274">
						<term>I ardently desired</term>
						<p>The desire encapsulated in this phrase will be borne out linguistically when Victor begins his course of instruction in the
							next chapter. At that point various cognates of "ardor" will echo through the text (I:3:1) and note, also I:3:6). At this
							early point, however, it is sufficient for the reader to recognize that the very language Victor uses echoes Walton's in
							his review of the course of his self-education (I:L1:2).</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="275">
						<term>I began</term>
						<p>There are 29 first-person singular pronouns in this paragraph; similarly, there are another 29 first-person pronouns (26
							singular) in I:3:3, as well as 25 in I:3:6 (where Victor dissolves his egocentrism in pontificatory admonishment of
							Walton's ambition), and a full 40 such pronouns in I:3:9. Mary Shelley thus dexterously underscores Victor's total
							self-involvement in his scientific pursuit.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="276">
						<term>I confessed, that I might obtain absolution</term>
						<p>Justine has confessed in order to procure last rites and entry into heaven after death. Yet, as a false confession cannot
							truly absolve a sinner, either Mary Shelley's protestant prejudice is showing, revealing a bias against or actual
							ignorance of Roman Catholic theology, or, more probably, she is quietly deepening her social critique to implicate the
							immorality of those who, entrusted with the spiritual lives of humanity, sell them out to the advantage of their own
							authority or of state power. It is also possible that she emphasizes the Catholicism of the Moritz household to mark a
							subtle prejudice against Justine in the minds of the Frankensteins, who seem to reflect the austere moralistic
							Protestantism for which Geneva was noted.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="277">
						<term>I could people the hours with creations</term>
						<p>If Mary Shelley's account of her childhood writing suggests affinities with her characterization of Clerval, the depiction
							of the Scottish idyll of her adolescence similarly encompasses her portrait of the young Elizabeth Lavenza, particularly
							her fondness for the "aërial creations of the poets" (see both 1818 (I:1:10) and 1831 (I:2:1) texts, and note).</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="278">
						<term>I did not speak</term>
						<p>This reticence about the Creature will come to have a self-perpetuating momentum that will cause widespread harm. In the
							case of Clerval, it would have been as easy for Victor to narrate his story as, later, it is with Walton. His holding-back
							is obviously an important plot device, but within the fiction itself it appears to reveal a deep, if unarticulated, sense
							of guilt on his part.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="279">
						<term>I fear, my friend</term>
						<p>Victor's interruption of his story reminds us of its fictive nature and reintroduces the problem of belief that will in
							numerous ways dominate the final pages of this first volume. It also quietly prepares us for a major shift in the plot. In
							terms of the novel's characterization, however, it might be read as Victor's way of reasserting an urbane control over a
							narration (as well as a narrator) evidencing signs of dangerous instability.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="280">
						<term>I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapidly</term>

					</item>
					<item n="281">
						<term>I gnashed my teeth</term>
						<p>We have already witnessed this physical manifestation of deep psychological conflict in the cabin of Walton's ship, when
							Victor is first recovering from exposure to the arctic elements (I:L4:10). A grieving Victor gnashes his teeth at the mere
							thought of the Creature in II:1:6. When we next observe the phenomenon, it will be the Creature who gnashes his teeth in
							response to the frustration of all his hopes (III:3:13 and note). The prototype for this act is the Satan of Paradise
							Lost: compare VI.340.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="282">
						<term>I have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions</term>
						<p>Even at this remove from the trial Victor unthinkingly puts his own claims to the fore, reminding us of his skill as a
							story-teller at the expense of Justine's claims as a victim of injustice. We cannnot forget that her very lack of
							eloquence has contributed to her victimization.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="283">
						<term>I lived principally in the country as a girl</term>
						<p>For whatever reason of self-presentation or nostalgia, Mary Shelley here magnifies her love of and accessibility to an
							untrammelled natural environment. Her Scottish experiences occupied less than two years of her early adolescence. Prior to
							that time she was brought up in Somers Town, in that day located on the edge of the London metropolis, where she could
							divide her interests between the countryside to the north, upon which her father's house looked out, and the attractions
							of the city. Godwin's house itself was anything but rural, maintaining an intensely urban and intellectually sophisticated
							ambience throughout Mary Shelley's youth. There, as a child, she came into contact with dozens of the principal luminaries
							of British culture at the beginning of the nineteenth century. One of these was Samuel Taylor, whom she heard recite "The
							Rime of the Ancient Mariner," a poem of particular resonance for Frankenstein, where it is quoted twice—(see I:L2:6 and
							I:4:7)—and frequently functions allusively.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="284">
						<term>I loved with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds</term>
						<p>This reticence is exactly what friendship is intended to transcend, if we take Walton's notion of its value as a benchmark.
							He looks to an ideal friend "to regulate [his] mind" (I:L2:2). Even Victor, in the revised text, conceives the value of a
							friend as being "to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures" (I:L4:23). Victor's reserve, however, negates this function
							of friendship, suggesting a limit to how far it is able to surmount the barriers of what a later time might call
							ego-defences.</p>

					<item n="285">

					</item>
					<item n="286">
						<term>a succession of imaginary incidents</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley's language here is resonant with the terms by which she describes the educational milieu within the
							Frankenstein circle. Thus, it cannot be accidental that she draws an implicit comparison between her own youthful career
							as a writer and that of her most imaginative character, Henry Clerval, who is described as smitten with a world of romance
							in both the 1818 (I:1:11) and 1831 (I:2:2) editions of the novel.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="287">
						<term>My imagination, unbidden, possessed and guided me</term>
						<p>With an uncanny artistry that must be considered deliberate, in this and the next paragraph Mary Shelley internalizes
							within her own writing the imaginative process by which Victor Frankenstein is first swept along by his scientific
							advances ("my imagination was too much exalted," I:3:7 and note), then becomes concerned by their obsessiveness ("[it] had
							taken an irresistible hold of my imagination," I:3:11 and note), and finally finds himself haunted by his own terrifying
							creation ("I imagined that the monster seized me," I:4:15). Throughout the novel, although the power of the human
							imagination is universally underscored, its uses or effects are as much deeply questioned as they are celebrated.</p>
						<p>In her introduction Mary Shelley appears to be purposefully collapsing the customary distinction between the curiosity of
							the scientist and the creative afflatus of the writer, a design we see carried out as well in the novel itself. Following
							these introductory materials, we will turn immediately, as yet a third example of the same elemental process, to the
							imaginative enthusiasm with which Robert Walton foresees his polar explorations (I:L1:2). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="288">
						<term>a point of view to the imagination</term>
						<p>This diction, like the subtitle and the epigraph, is meant to drape Frankenstein with a seriousness of purpose not
							customary among popular gothic novels. To students of British Romanticism, it is language that is characteristic of Percy
							Bysshe Shelley's own practices in the prefatory matter to his poems. He frequently accentuates his attempt to transcend
							through imaginative means the normative, or "ordinary," thoughts and passions of humanity. See, for example, the first
							paragraph of the Preface to "Alastor" (published in March 1816) or his explanation of the use of dramatic imagery in the
							Preface to The Cenci (1820). The reader will discover that the uses of the imagination are likewise to become a recurring
							theme in the novel.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="289">
						<term>spent in inaction</term>
						<p>Beaufort's introverted withdrawal is of a type similar to further and more conspicuous examples we will encounter later in
							the text. It may well be that Victor Frankenstein is himself too implicated in this sort of response to notice the
							parallels, but the more objective reader is here being alerted to another of the thematic concerns the novel will develop.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="290">
						<term>incomprehensible to me</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley's point seems to be that, whatever Victor's enthusiasm for the sciences, at this point in his adolescent

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="291">
						<term>increase of misery</term>
						<p>Although the discussion may seem to have moved far from the structural center of the novel, the resonance of this phrase
							reminds us of the glorious ambitions driving both Walton and Victor Frankenstein and of how Victor's aspiration that "many
							happy and excellent natures would owe their being to" him (I:3:8) has been disastrously subverted into a murder and
							miscarriage of justice implicating both his Creature and himself.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="292">
						<term>indeed every human being</term>
						<p>Victor here openly deprives the Creature of a human essence and thus of the requirements of human sympathy. In other words,
							even as he upholds Justine's innocence against a legal system that indicts her on circumstantial evidence, he himself
							embodies the fundamental principles of a dehumanized injustice against which he will inveigh.</p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="293">
						<term>inexorable fate</term>
						<p>As at other key points in the revision of the novel, Victor's inflation of rhetoric as he invokes fate calls attention at
							once to his self-pity and his sense that he lacked any options that could have altered his destiny. As we turn to the
							second of the three parts of Frankenstein, that conclusion will be seriously interrogated.</p>
						<p/>

						<term>Ingolstadt</term>
						<p>Ingolstadt, Germany, lies on the Danube and Schutter Rivers, 45 miles north of Munich and 30 miles south of Regensburg.</p>
						<p>Records of this cultural and commercial center of Bavaria go back to the beginning of the 9th century C.E. The city is
							surrounded by fourteenth-century walls, and is distinguished by a ducal castle (1420), the Cathedral of Our Lady
							(1425-1500), the Church of Maria de Victoria (1732-36). For centuries it was the seat of the Dukes of Bavaria, who
							transferred to Munich only in 1800, leaving Ingolstadt a relatively small provincial city (current population c. 90,000).
							The brief account in the 4th edition of the Encyclopaedia Brittanica (1797), written before this event and roughly
							contemporary with the timeframe of the novel, gives no hint of the town's impending displacement.</p>
						<p>A university was founded there in 1472, although it was moved to Landshut in 1800 and then to Munich in 1826. At the height
							of its importance in the Renaissance the city and the university were a stronghold of Counter-Reformation orthodoxy.</p>
						<p>In the eighteenth century an intellectual fervor of an opposite sort was centered there, when a secret society, an offspin
							of the Masons self-styled the Illuminati, was formed in Ingolstadt to consider the means to a revolutionary reconstruction
							of European society. Although their actual effect was small, they constituted an easy target for reactionary agitators who
							traced the debacle of the French Revolution to this improbable source. The main purveyors of this reactionary propaganda
							were John Playfair's Proofs of a Conspiracy Against All the Religions and Governments of Europe (1797) and the Abbé
							Augustin Barruel's Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire du Jacobinisme (1797). The latter volume was read by both Mary and
							Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1814-1815.</p>
						<p>These and other similar works were the basis for a novel, with a long episode set in Bavaria and drawing upon the secret
							society of Illuminati, written by Thomas Jefferson Hogg, Shelley's roommate at Oxford, Memoirs of Prince Alexy Haimatoff
							(1813). Shelley wrote the notice of the novel that appeared in the Critical Review in December 1814. It is thus impossible
							for Mary not to have been well aware of the political contexts in which she inserts her youthful protagonist.</p>

						<p>To disobey such an injunction, with its almost institutionalized cultural sanction, is to commit a transgression of

							Clerval had been candid about the depth and cause of his illness. Yet, Clerval is at no fault, since he, too, is kept in

						<p>As with many of her interpolations in 1831, Mary Shelley here seems intent on an early establishment of a pattern that will

							state of nightmare and half-sleep on the night after the Creature is created (I:5:3) and will reveal itself in Volumes 2

							share a sternness of resolve and a narrow preoccupation with business success, may suggest a comparable rigidity, or at

						<p>The shadowy presence of Italy behind this narrative has not been explained. It may reflect discussions about moving there

							emigrate to Italy. On a less personal note, however, the presence of Italy does extend the geographical bounds of the
							pan-European setting to the south, just as the opening in Russia extends them far to the north. Safie, it should be noted,

					<item n="309">

						<p>This is the opening of the fourth chapter (I:4:1) in the original edition, which lends weight to one's sense that what Mary

					</item>
					<item n="311">

					</item>
					<item n="312">
						<term>I was now alone</term>
						<p>A sentence with an ominous sound, resonating throughout the novel, back to Walton's sense of isolation in Archangel,
							(I:L2:2), his ice-bound ship (I:L4:2), the discovery of Victor marooned on an ice-floe (I:L4:6 and note) and to the
							enforced isolation in which his Creature is forced to pass his entire existence (II:3:1 and II:8:4). Of particular weight
							in this diction is its reflection of famous lines in Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" to which Walton has already
							referred suggestively. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="313">
						<term>I wept like a child</term>
						<p>Victor's account of himself in these paragraphs testifies to a person on the brink of becoming unhinged—almost paralyzed,
							needing two days at Lausanne to recover a sense of purpose, invoking his native landscape in effusive tears. Such immature
							behavior could be a sign of the fears he has repressed for a year and a half, and certainly for the reader their emotional
							heightening portends some new disaster about to reveal itself. At the same time, if we wish to assume that this is a novel
							with pretensions to being realistic, and not merely gothic in its representation, we might wish here to turn our attention
							from the ominous to the psychological. These are all symptoms of a personality that has barely survived its breakdown. The
							year of convalesence has offered tranquillity, but does not appear to have altered the essential trauma Victor has
							suffered in the Creature's birth. Throughout the rest of the novel, Mary Shelley adroitly poises her protagonist on the
							edge of madness, and the readers of his behavior (a class that should include Walton as well as us) can never be quite
							sure on what side of the line he stands. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="314">
						<term>join with my enemies</term>
						<p>In the courtroom (I:7:7) Justine had surmised that she had no enemies on earth. After a verdict that is untrue to her
							character and her actions, she sees nothing but enemies around her. The norms of her world are now wholly upended. The

							at the same time fragile. </p>

					<item n="315">
						<term>through his interest he might become a judge</term>
						<p>This inconspicuous detail seems carefully planted by Mary Shelley to reveal how closely tied-in Alphonse Frankenstein is to
							what will soon reveal itself to be a corrupt system of justice in Geneva. It also subtly suggests how the governing elite
							in the patriarchal Genevan society protects itself, a situation already alluded to at the beginning (I:1:1) of Victor's
							narrative. </p>

						<term>June</term>
						<p>The summer months will allow Walton to proceed north with expedition under the midnight sun and with less fear of

							in his romantic enthusiasm hopes for easy passage he has radically miscalculated the treacherous conditions of the Arctic. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="317">
						<term>a sense of justice</term>
						<p>We are to recall that the Frankenstein family tradition has been to enter into public service, most particularly acting in
							the capacity of syndics, or magistrates (I:1:1). Thus Alphonse Frankenstein's sense of rectitude may be advanced here as a
							standard whereby to measure that of his son, also that of his society. At the same time, as a man who is so completely
							bound by the system he has served that he cannot conceive that it might act wrongly, or who is so unprepared to recognize
							injustice as a potential outcome of the weighing of purely circumstantial evidence, Alphonse Frankenstein, the
							representative citizen of Geneva, may have so narrow a perspective on truth that, even were it to appear self-evident, it
							might still never be wholly just. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="318">
						<term>the justice of our judges</term>
						<p>Alphonse Frankenstein's complacency stems from his sense of a professional brotherhood with these men, for, it must be
							remembered from the beginning (I:1:1) of Victor's narrative, that Alphonse too has sat in the syndic's chair, as had his
							ancestors before him. Mary Shelley stresses not only the tight-knit patriarchy of Genevan society, but also, more
							narrowly, the ease with which the system can implicate all its members in an act of injustice, even when, as is the case
							with the Frankenstein family, they are convinced of the innocence of the accused. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="319">
						<term>Justine was very ill</term>
						<p>As Caroline Frankenstein contracted scarlet fever from tending Elizabeth, so it would appear that Justine contracted it
							from her but because of her youth survived. The selflessless of feminine minstration is quietly underscored. So is the
							general vulnerablity of human beings, which should remind the reader that it is this susceptibility to disease and
							dissolution that Victor had sought through his researches to ameliorate. </p>

						<p>If Walton is truly using this word in a painterly sense, then the meaning is unusual, centered on the concept of harmony or

						<term>Lackington, Hughes, Harding, Mavor, &amp; Jones</term>
						<p>Percy Bysshe Shelley, feigning the author's being abroad, handled the negotiations for a contract to publish Frankenstein,

							himself suggested such an avenue to the Shelleys. Whatever the case, Murray declined the manuscript, upon whose refusal
							Shelley reverted to his own publisher Charles Ollier. When Ollier, too, declined to accept the book, the Shelleys were in
							something of a quandary. They resolved it by turning to a publishing house—Lackington's—that had a large inventory and
							specialized somewhat in sensational materials. In the two-page advertisement sheet accompanying the novel when it was
							published in 1818 are representative works that the Lackington firm apparently thought might interest the reader of the
							novel: these include Francis Barrett, The Magus; or Celestial Intelligences; a complete System of Occult Philosophy, being
							a Summary of all the best Writers on the subjects of Magic, Alchymy, Magnetism, the Cabala &amp;c. (1801); Francis

						<p>Today, Switzerland and Italy share access to Lake Como as they do to the larger Lago Maggiore somewhat to its west. The
							Shelleys and Claire Clairmont stopped at Lake Como in the spring of 1818 and, they claimed, would have settled there had
							they been able to find suitable lodgings. In the event, their fortunes led them further south, and Mary Shelley herself
							was not to return to the fabled beauty of these surroundings until well after the revised edition of Frankenstein was
							published. She obviously returned there frequently in her imagination. It is on Lake Como that the small remnant of
							survivors for a time is able to reestablish a human community in The Last Man, her novel of 1826. Years later, her lengthy

						<term>acquainted with more languages</term>
						<p>Walton's inability to speak other languages would presumably magnify his sense of isolation after almost four months in
							Russia. Generally speaking, in this pan-European novel Mary Shelley conveniently allows her characters, wherever they come
							from or are educated, to communicate freely across national borders. The exception is the Arab Safie, who must be taught
							by the De Laceys to speak their language. Since the book chosen for that end is Volney's Les Ruines, ou meditations sur
							les revolutions des empires (II:5:14), she and the Creature who secretly participates in her lessons are educated in
							French. French is likewise the language of the Frankenstein household, but Victor, in I:1:12, recounts his education in
							Latin, Greek, English and German: he receives his scientific education in German, in the heart of Bavaria at Ingolstadt,
							and is adept enough in English to negotiate his way around Scotland and the Orkney Islands. While in prison there his
							delirious ravings revert to French, which only Mr. Kirwin the magistrate is able to understand (III:4:11). When he hails
							Walton, the mariner will tell his sister in I:L4:7, Victor does so in English "although with a foreign accent." By the
							time the Creature and Walton meet one another, however, Mary Shelley finesses her otherwise careful observation of
							linguistic difference in favor of an unimpeded confrontation; yet Victor's concern that his narration be faithfully
							recorded (III:WC:4) and his warning that the Creature's eloquence should be distrusted (III:7:25) emphasize radical
							instability and the problematic of translation as inherent in language. </p>

						<p>From this diction it appears that Elizabeth is included among the "we" of this circle who are instructed in both a useful

							language of the Frankenstein household (as it is of Geneva). Obviously, English is here singled out in order to justify
							Victor's narration as being conducted wholly in English. At what point the German in which he is taught at Ingolstadt
							enters his educational program is left unmentioned, but by the age of seventeen he will be fluent in it (I:1:26). No note

						<p>In other words, Victor rejects the possibility of creating unlimited gold in the interest of discovering the root laws of

						<p>It was conquered by the Protestant Reformers the Bernese in the sixteenth century. In 1798, however, Lausanne fell to
							Napoleon, who made the city the capital of the Vaud canton of the new Helvetic Republic in 1803. Its pre-Napoleonic
							political structure is described in the 4th edition of the Encyclopaedia Brittanica (1797). For a time in the eighteenth
							century, Lausanne was home to Voltaire, Rousseau, and Edward Gibbon (who wrote most of his Decline and Fall there).</p>

						<p>The vast power of a sublime nature returns to the text, preparing us for the reintroduction of the being animated by and

						<term>the linkage between the scientific concerns of Victor Frankenstein and Robert Walton</term>
						<p>Walton's polar exploration, with its concern for the secret of magnetism (I:L1:2), and Victor's experiments with
							electricity (I:1:23) as vital fluid intersect with one of the most exciting scientific breakthroughs of the later
							eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Although Erasmus Darwin's scientific take on the linkage—that it is somehow to
							be explained by basic chemistry rather than the mechanics of physics—is wrong, what impels it is not. Indeed, though it is
							pedestrian in manner, the lengthy twelfth note to The Temple of Nature is nothing short of visionary. There Darwin first
							extensively expounds the dynamics of electricity, then turns to the similar processes of magnetism, bifurcated
							figuratively between arctic and antarctic poles, and in the end links the two with a rudimentary conception of atomic
							physics (only to be expounded by John Dalton in the decade after Darwin's death), and with the third component of the
							Grand Unified Field Theory, gravitation. That Mary Shelley is aware of this conjunction can be deduced from Walton's hope
							that his discoveries will help astronomers "regulate a thousand celestial observations."</p>

						<term>the living spirit of love</term>
						<p>The sexist stereotypes in which this tribute is expressed can be (as they have been) laid at Mary Shelley's doorstep. But
							it is, after all, Victor who is speaking, and his monologue is telling the reader a great deal about him that he does not
							seem to realize. Since this is a technique by which fictional characterization is traditionally accomplished, perhaps the
							reader will want to hold him as a character fully responsible for his own sentiments. The Preface, we will remember, went
							out of its way to separate the author from her characters (I:Pref:2).</p>
						<p>Leaving Victor's perspective to the side, we may, as readers, surely honor the affectionate warmth with which Elizabeth
							assumes her nurturing domestic role and melds her small community together. We might wish, however, to suspend judgment on
							its absolute value until later events can confirm that it profits her as much as it does those she so selflessly serves. </p>

						<p>Ingolstadt lies almost 500 miles to the northeast of Geneva. The trip there, depending on how hard the young Victor pushed

						<p>The diction will be echoed in Victor's account of the Creature's departure from their encounter in Volume 2, when he is
							"quickly lost . . . among the undulations of the sea of ice" (II:9:18) and again in the final phrase of the novel where he
							will be "lost in darkness and distance" (III:WC:48). </p>

						<term>I seemed to have lost all soul or sensation</term>
						<p>The terms become starker and starker, now directly figured as beyond Victor's control, the operations of a destiny in which

							As Victor nears success in his endeavor to create life, it is as if the process directly saps his own vitality.</p>
						<p>Perhaps, however, there is an alternate, less dire, way of reading this condition, as reflecting Mary Shelley's own
							experience with motherhood. On some preconscious mental level, Victor is shown to be replicating the experience of the
							expectant mother whose physical being is strongly affected by the second being gestating in her womb. </p>

					<item n="344">
						<term>My father loved Beaufort</term>
						<p>The reader cannot help noticing how insistently this theme returns to the surface of the text. In the abstract it is almost
							an epitome of the way in which Mary Shelley creates the structure of her novel as a nest of Chinese boxes (or Russian
							dolls). Here, Victor Frankenstein begins a narrative about his life by emphasizing his father's profound affection for
							another man, an account he gives to a young explorer whose deepest emotional need is for such a friendship. Walton, in
							turn, feels he has found the fulfillment of this need in Victor, and Victor himself tells this narrative out of a sense of
							duty to that friendship. Duty likewise drove his father in his attempt to discover and rescue Beaufort. At the periphery
							of this replicated order is the central location in which the narrative unfolds, a ship isolated in treacherous northern
							waters where the all-male crew stands on its duty on behalf of one another. In the end harsh circumstances will force
							Walton to respond against his will to his own duty to those men. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="345">
						<term>love him as a brother</term>
						<p>Victor seems very much the type of friend for whom Walton was longing in I:L2:2, and his solicitude for the stranger's

							almost a month while Victor through the narration of his life becomes himself a troubling aspect of Walton's own
							existence. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="346">
						<term>madness</term>
						<p>The "astonishment" of two paragraphs earlier has transmogrified into a much deeper suspicion on Walton's part. The reader
							should take the doubt that is planted here seriously, since questions concerning Victor Frankenstein's sanity will
							intensify as the novel continues, becoming pronounced late in his narrative—which is to say, in the novel's chronology,
							only weeks before his rescue. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="347">
						<term>secret of the magnet</term>
						<p>A major hazard of navigation in polar regions was a wholesale distortion of magnetic instruments caused by the proximity of
							the pure magnetic impulse. Walton seems to expect that once the actual pole is reached, one could learn the principles by
							which to adjust for such distortion. In 1831 Sir John Ross for the first time located the magnetic pole, which is distinct
							from the actual geographical pole, in the far northern reaches of Canadian territory. His account of his supposed
							discovery bears an enthusiasm and rhetorical inflation little different from the tone Walton adopts here. From the
							evidence gathered in the Parry and Ross expeditions of 1827 and 1829-31, respectively, Michael Faraday was, indeed, to do
							just that, as promulgated in what became known as Faraday's Law. A different desire seems to be drawing the novel's second
							searcher for the north pole, and the one who will presumably discover its exact site a full century before Commodore
							Parry, Victor Frankenstein's Creature. In Walton's fourth letter to his sister (I:L4:3) he innocently recounts being
							passed by this figure on his way to the pole. See also "wondrous power" above. </p>

						<term>make others so</term>
						<p>The aspirations to happiness of all the major characters of the novel take very different paths. Although less effectual
							than the principal male characters in bringing their dreams to reality, it might be said that the women characters are all
							more directly engaged in increasing the actual store of happiness in the world, whereas the men in general attach
							themselves to a theoretical concept that rules their destiny with often destructive results. Justine's emphasis on a
							practical ethics may also go beyond conventional gender roles, reflecting the down-to-earth necessities of a servant who
							has no choice but to work for and with others to increase human comfort. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="349">
						<term>man</term>
						<p>The lieutenant, earlier introduced by Walton as a person who "retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity" (I:L2:4),
							perhaps naturally thinks of the Creature within a conventional human framework, twice referring to him as a "man." This
							nomenclature will change radically as Victor seizes the discourse and begins to define its categories. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="350">
						<term>the manly and heroical poetry</term>
						<p>Here the geographical contrast is made sharply clear: east and west divide along a rigid gender demarcation. That Mary

							elsewhere in his discourse without feeling that the text is being stretched to support a feminist interpretation foreign
							to it. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="351">
						<term>occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley has already prepared for Walton's receptivity to Victor's story, since in the narrative he acknowledges to his
							sister, "there is a love for the marvellous, a belief in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects" (I:L2:6). In the
							context in which Mary Shelley was writing, an apt synonym for the word would be "romantic." </p>

						<term>the breaking of a mast</term>
						<p>Just such an event happened early on in the expedition of Sir John Ross, as the Victory was dismasted in a gale on 14 June
							1829. An engraving of this appears opposite page 32 in Sir John Ross, Narrative of a Second Voyage in Search of a
							north-west passage and of a residence in the Arctic Regions, during the Years 1829, 1830, 1831, 1832, and 1833 (London:

					<item n="353">
						<term>mathematics</term>
						<p>The stress on mathematics seems curious, given Victor's interests in occult and magical lore. Still, Albertus Magnus was
							best known as a mathematician, and his disciple could be expected to follow the master's bent. Perhaps Mary Shelley also
							wishes to direct our attention to an underlying inclination to abstraction in Victor that will account for his tendency to

						<term>I expressed myself in measured terms</term>
						<p>This interpolation in the 1831 text seems innocent enough, perhaps designed to show that the young Victor Frankenstein is
							on the path to a mature respect for a scientific discipline and those who practice it. On closer examination, however,
							this seemingly innocent remark begins to build a foundation for a vexing issue in the novel: the extent to which Victor's
							attempt to condition his rhetoric to the interests of his listener is merely manipulative and thus, whatever its
							appearance, not wholly to be trusted. As the novel progresses, this narrative indeterminacy will touch most of its major

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="356">
						<term>men on whom I can depend</term>
						<p>The public realm of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is so insistently masculine that the reader must construe this as a
							deliberate aspect of the novel's construction. The wholly male crew of the ship will, later in the first volume, be
							replicated in the exclusively male ambience of the University of Ingolstadt and the more narrow and even sinister
							magistracy of Geneva. By the second volume the novel's main characters have committed themselves and the novel to a

					<item n="358">
						<term>merely weaving a series of supernatural terrors</term>
						<p>The repetition of a note of disparagement ("merely weaving," "a mere tale") in this and the succeeding sentence indicate

						<p>The addition of such powerfully honorific diction is clearly meant to strengthen the reader's impression of Victor

						<p>Why Mary Shelley should begin the chapter by deliberately obliterating all suspense is a good question not easily answered.

							of the polity of Geneva. Since Geneva's republican government (I:1:1 and note) and its softening of class hierarchies
							(I:5:3 and note) have already been admiringly stressed, we might expect from Mary Shelley's political allegiances to
							witness a trial conducted in ideal circumstances. But that is far from being the case. Instead of a jury of peers, a panel
							of male magistrates decides Justine's lot, and to exonerate a verdict reached by only circumstantial evidence they employ
							the coercive power of the church to extort a false confession. Victor's private denunciation of these proceedings does not
							indict his own society or consider the extent to which his own family, that long line of syndics, is complicit in an
							injustice that is all but institutionalized. It will be left for his Creature, who is likewise victimized, to articulate
							the more radical implications of such a society (see II:5:15). </p>

					</item>
					<item n="369">
						<term>the moral relations of things</term>
						<p>In distinguishing so sharply between scientific and moral arenas of thought, or between metaphysics and ethics as branches
							of philosophy, Victor unconsciously begins to raise what is perhaps the major issue of the novel, a human being's
							responsibility for knowledge. His abstract nouns are themselves revealing: he is engaged by the "substance" or the
							"spirit," whereas what impels Clerval are the "relations" of things. Clerval implicitly looks at the universe in terms of
							communities, which is to say, in the largest sense, as political relations; Victor concentrates on individual matters in
							isolation. In respect to this dialectic it is interesting to contemplate how intrinsically committed to both its sides is
							Walton. That dual commitment will in the end become contradictory, leaving Walton on the horns of a dilemma, having to
							choose between pure science and moral obligation. </p>

						<term>The murderer discovered</term>
						<p>It is impossible to know for certain what tone—whether it is shock or relief—that Mary Shelley intends to be conveyed by
							this exclamation of Victor's. In both the 1818 and 1831 texts he almost gives himself away, then recovers before his
							younger brother's incomprehension and his father's subsequent imperious self-assurance and, rather than be open with his

							eighteenth-century world into which the Creature comes as new-born.</p>

						<p>Isabel Baxter became Mary's close friend almost by accident. Mary's early adolescence had been troubled, particularly

							rebelliousness. He contacted a radical acquaintance from the 1790s, Richard Baxter, a Scotsman who was a good friend of
							his own friend David Booth, who agreed to accept Mary into his family in Dundee. There at the age of fourteen she took up
							a happy residence that, as this account indicates, combined a closeness to nature with a warm affection for the Baxters'
							middle daughter Isabel. With this family she resided from June to November 1812, and from June 1813 to March 1814. Her
							elopement with the married Percy Bysshe Shelley not long after her return from this second residence ruptured her

						<p>Here Victor has not only demonized his Creature but has cast him in an adversarial role, not acknowledging at this point

							those produced through affection. That this most distant of objectified namings coincides with an almost hysterical sense

						<p>-- Louis Trenchard More, Isaac Newton: A Biography (New York: Scribner's, 1934), p. 664.</p>
						<p> Samuel Johnson alludes to this comment in Rambler 83:</p>

						<p>It is probably too early in the novel for the intonation of this phrase to resonate fully, but by the time Victor has

						<term>This noble war in the sky</term>
						<p>This seemingly offhand sentimentalism is in actuality an exceedingly subtle move on Mary Shelley's part, suggestive of how
							dangerous unexamined metaphors can be, especially those that stem from our day-to-day existence and common practices.
							Victor Frankenstein, deeply aware from his scientific experiments that electricity achieves its dynamic energy from the
							interplay of polarities, here sees in the heavens an example of that polarity writ large and, as it were, iconically—as
							elemental warfare. He will almost immediately transfer that icon into an earthly counterpart, a permanent struggle between
							positive and negative poles, by which he respectively denominates himself and his Creature as good and evil, as figures of
							God and Satan. Thus, almost unconsciously adopting a quasi-divine sign, Victor reinforces the animosity that allowed him
							conveniently to categorize, externalize, and thus alienate as Other the Creature whom he brought to life and then left to
							his own devices (see I:4:3 and note). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="402">

					<item n="403">
						<term>I have no enemy on earth</term>
						<p>This is, indeed, the case, and this fact deeply complicates the novel. The Creature incriminates Justine not because he
							knows, as with William, of a connection to the Frankenstein household, but because she is a person whose ordinary
							sympathies, he presumes, would be blocked in his presence. Without thinking, he too victimizes Justine, and he does it on
							the grounds, since sympathy is more readily expected of women, of her gender. For his explanation, see II:8:35. </p>

						<p>The trip home, as Victor testified in the preceding chapter (I:2:8), would doubtless be long and arduous, but his passing

							from normative social ties. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="405">
						<term>none but the devil</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley characteristically complicates the moral lines here. Even as Justine is called a "monster," she resorts to her

							terminology as Victor does is a nice irony. But if we then seriously accept his own claim of ultimate responsibility for
							this debacle, Justine's invocation of the devil is tantamount to an ironic accusation against Victor, implicitly inverting
							his earlier (I:3:8) moral exoneration of himself as a godlike creator. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="406">
						<term>the misery that I then endured</term>
						<p>In contrast to the shared grief and affection of Elizabeth and Justine, Victor has immured himself in a barricaded

						<term>No father could claim the gratitude</term>
						<p>The terms have grown increasingly self-centered, until here Victor casts himself in an absolute posture, anticipating a

							the complementary, though ironic text, in Satan's desire to escape what he considers a necessitated, automatic response to
							God's genesis of spiritual and corporeal being: </p>      lifted up so high<lb/> I sdeined subjection, and thought one

						<p>Modern pedagogy might admiringly term this a wholly noncompetitive educational environment. Even that description, however,

							discerned in any other major novel in English.</p>
						<p> In 1812, three years before the summer in which Frankenstein was conceived, Percy Bysshe Shelley published the first of
							this couple's reinterpretations of the Prometheus myth, suggesting that the significance of the titan's carrying fire to
							earth was as a means of introducing flesh-eating to humanity. From that point on the pristine human civilization was
							ravaged by disease. This seventeenth of the sometimes very long endnotes to his "philosophical poem" Queen Mab (a note to

						<term>my own spirit</term>
						<p>The doppelgänger or double is a feature of gothic tales throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth century. As a literary

							Percy Bysshe Shelley incorporated the figure within the first act of Prometheus Unbound, where the Earth tells Prometheus
							of a second realm of potentiality that shadows the actual world: </p>
						<p>     Ere Babylon was dust,<lb/> The Magus Zoroaster, my dead child,<lb/> Met his own image walking in the garden.<lb/> That
							apparition, sole of men, he saw.<lb/> -- I.191-95</p>
						<p>Mary Shelley, too, is concerned with potentiality, both its development and its thwarting, which she pursues on a number of
							different levels in this novel, projecting the doubling on moral and psychological, but also on mythic and theological,
							grounds. Up to this point in the novel the theme of doubling has been only hinted at in the intensities of male friendship
							we have encountered. Here, in directly introducing doubling as a psychological condition, her basic stress is on the
							self-division and resulting self-destructiveness that, we may now begin to realize, is the driving force behind the arctic

						<p>Paracelsus, pseudonym of Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, 1493-1541, physician, alchemist, and mystic.</p>
						<p>Little is known of Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, who took the name Paracelsus for himself. He was the son to a

						<p>He argued that human life could be created through alchemy, and believed in the long-sought-after elixir vitae as a means
							of infinitely prolonging life free from disease. His lasting contribution to science is the rejection of Galen's humoral

						<term>passage near the pole</term>
						<p>The Northwest Passage, and (to a lesser extent because less practicable) the Northeast Passage, were major objects of
							exploration in the later eighteenth century, renewed after peace returned to Europe in 1815 with the strong backing of the
							British government as seemingly being crucial to Britain's domination of the seas and to the commerce that held together
							the Empire. As with other scientific aspects of Mary Shelley's novel, this ambition of Walton's has a large cultural and
							political resonance.</p>
						<p>Before the creation of the Suez Canal (completed in 1869) and the Panama Canal (begun 1882, completed 1914), navigation
							between the hemispheres was a complicated process, involving lengthy trips around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa or
							the Cape of Horn in South America, both notoriously difficult to navigate. Explorers turned their attention to the north,
							in the hopes of finding a means of sailing from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Two major paths, a Northeast Passage and a
							Northwest Passage, were sought for centuries, with minimal success. Northeast Passage The searches for a Northeast Passage
							-- one from the north of Scandinavia, into the Arctic Basin, and along the north coast of Asia -- began in the late
							sixteenth century. In 1596, fifteen Dutch sailors, led by Jacob van Heemskerck and Willem Barents, tried to complete the
							Northeast Passage, only to be trapped in June near the northcape of Novaya Zemlya. The sailors were trapped there for
							months in an ad-hoc dwelling built from driftwood they called Het Behouden Huys (the Saved House; the site was discovered
							in 1871). Their ordeal was described in print by one of the sailors, Gerrit de Veer, in 1598.</p>
						<p>Most of the searches for a Northeast Passage, though, were carried out by Russia, which hoped to increase the profitability
							of its fur trade by finding a more direct route from the Atlantic to the Pacific. By the end of the 16th century the
							Russians had established a commercial route via the Arctic to the fur-trading centre of Mangazeya on the Taz River in
							western Siberia. But a polar passage was still greatly desired. Several archaelogical digs in Taymyr in the 1940s provide
							evidence of an unsuccessful Russian mission to sail the Northeast Passage in or shortly after 1619.</p>
						<p>By 1645, Russian trading vessels were routinely sailing between the Kolyma and Lena Rivers along the Arctic coast. In 1648,
							Semyon Dezhnyov, a Cossack, was the first European to sail what is now called the Bering Strait. He sailed east from the
							Kolyma toward the Anadyr basin, believed to be rich in furs. Although several of his ships were destroyed, Dezhnyov
							reached Cape Olyutorsky, from which he traveled overland to the north to the Anadyr.</p>
						<p>Dezhnyov's voyage aroused interest in exploration in Russia. In the 1720s, Peter the Great authorized a number of voyages
							to the area he had first sailed. It was Vitus Bering, an officer of Danish birth who served in the Russian navy, who made
							the most important discoveries. In 1728 he discovered St. Lawrence Island and sailed through the Bering Strait (named for
							him) and well into the Arctic Ocean, although, because he did not see Alaska, he did not realize how far he had in fact
							sailed. Four years later, two Russians, Ivan Fyodorov and Mikhail Gvozdev, were the first Europeans to see Alaska.</p>
						<p>The discovery of a passage to the Pacific led to the greatest operation in the history of polar exploration, the Great
							Northern Expedition, which began in 1733 and continued through 1743. Vitus Bering led the expeditions, carried out by
							nearly a thousand men, many of whom died from cold, scurvy, or other accidents. Such setbacks caused the Russian
							government to withdraw its support, but the mission was successful in producing sixty-two maps of the Arctic coast from
							Archangelsk to Cape Bolshoy Baranov. The only other Russian expedition in the next few decades was carried out by Nikita
							Shalaurov, a trader without government support, whose party was killed by the cold in 1764.</p>
						<p>After Captain James Cook sailed from the Pacific north through the Bering Strait as far as Cape North (now Cape Shmidt),
							Catherine the Great renewed Russian interest in polar expeditions. Catherine hired Joseph Billings, a member of Cook's
							crew, to travel overland from St. Lawrence Bay to Nizhnekolymsk in the search for a gap between Chaun Bay and the Bering

							Henry VII sent John Cabot in search of a northwest route from Europe to the Orient. Jacques Cartier and Gaspar and Miguel
							Corte-Real similarly explored Canada in hopes of discovering such a passage.</p>
						<p>Navigators began searching in earnest for a water route from the Atlantic to the Pacific in the sixteenth century with Sir
							Martin Frobisher (1535-1594); subsequent explorers included John Davis, Henry Hudson (who in 1609 explored the New York
							river and Canadian bay that now bear his name), and William Baffin. In 1768, Samuel Hearne set out on a two-year walking
							expedition, which took him as far as the shore of the Arctic Ocean, but he found no passage.</p>
						<p>With the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, England, in an attempt to secure its naval superiority and the enormous
							commercial advantage that came with it, began what eventually became a decades-long endeavor to discover the Northwest
							passage. The Passage eluded explorers through Mary Shelley's lifetime; as late as 1845, Sir John Franklin set out on an
							expedition that ended in the loss of the entire expedition of 129 men. The Passage was discovered only in the 1850s by Sir
							Robert McClure, who led one of the forty search parties that sought information on Franklin's expedition. McClure's
							expedition was icebound for nearly two years, and was rescued by Captain Henry Kellett; Kellett's ship was in turn
							icebound for another year.</p>
						<p>The Passage itself runs through the Arctic Islands of Canada some 500 miles north of the Arctic Circle, only 1,200 miles
							from the North Pole. The 900-mile east-west water route runs from Baffin Island to the Beaufort Sea through a field of
							thousands of icebergs, and thence into the Pacific through the Bering Strait, which separates Siberia from Alaska.</p>
						<p>Even after the Passage was discovered, it took another half century for a single ship to sail through it: the Norwegian
							explorer Roald Amundsen made the passage between 1903 and 1906. Although the centuries-long search for the route was
							inspired by the desire for a more efficient trading route, the first successful commercial navigation came only in 1969,
							after the discovery of oil in Alaska. </p>

						<p>Physiognomy is a pseudoscientific discipline that purports to find correspondences between psychological attributes and

							well aware, this discipline was resurrected in the later eighteenth century by a countryman of Victor Frankenstein's,
							Johann Kaspar Lavater (11 November 1741 - 2 January 1801), a resident of Zurich. His Essays on Physiognomy (1775-1778;
							translated into English in 1789-1798) made him world-famous, inspiring many a quack psychologist of his day, and many
							further days across the ensuing century. More seriously relevant for the context of Frankenstein might be the title of an

						<term>our placid home, and our contented hearts</term>
						<p>Elizabeth's conformity to her female lot, staying in Geneva rather than traveling to Ingolstadt to care for Victor,

							many critics who, from this and similar evidence, see the novel as enforcing a mindless domesticity as the only
							alternative to the overreaching of the male protagonists. Yet, to take this passage at face value as the expression not of
							Elizabeth but of Mary Shelley, is not really defensible as a critical reading. Elizabeth's blandness is an aspect of her
							character. Her satisfaction with, broadly speaking, the beautiful is certainly an aspect of the female role in this
							period, but in no way does her author resemble her in this narrow predeliction. Nor does the novel unquestionably
							reinforce it. After all, the first direct view we as readers have had of this serene landscape was as a violent
							thunderstorm burst from over the Jura mountains (I:1:22). When in the second volume Victor enters into, instead of gazing

						<p>Caius Plinius Secundus, CE 23-79, Roman naturalist.</p>
						<p>Pliny the Elder was the author of Historia naturalis, the principal compendium of scientific knowledge for the original

							translated the encyclopedic work on metallurgy, pharmacology, zoology, anthropology, and psychology into English.</p>
						<p>The Natural History is the only one of Pliny's seven writings to survive antiquity entire. That work in thirty-seven books
							was an attempt to survey all natural knowledge systematically in an unadorned style, and his methodical approach and
							careful regard for citation make it a model of ancient scientific research, in spite of Pliny's superstitious beliefs in
							magic. Book 1 is an introduction to the entire work. Book 2 addresses cosmology and astronomy; books 3 through 6 are on
							geography. The next thirteen books treat biology: zoology in books 7 through 11, botany in books 12 through 19. Books 20
							through 22 address medicine; books 23 through 37 are concerned with metals, minerals, and precious stones.</p>
						<p>Pliny's authority was comparable to Aristotle's throughout the Middle Ages; only in 1492 did he come under attack in
							Niccolò Leoniceno's catalogue of his errors. From then on its influence waned by degrees, and few regarded it seriously as

						<term>John William Polidori</term>
						<p> John William Polidori (7 September 1795-24 August 1821) was the son of Gaetano Polidori, a Tuscan man of letters and at
							one point secretary to the dramatist Vittorio Alfieri, who had emigrated to England where he married a Miss Pierce and
							settled in London as a teacher of Italian. John was educated at Ampleforth, Yorkshire -- a Roman Catholic school -- and
							subsequently matriculated at the University of Edinburgh, where he studied medicine, writing a dissertation -- Dissertatio
							medica inauguralis, quaedam de morbo, oneirodynia dicto, complectens ...  -- on the highly romantic subject of
							sleep-walking and receiving his medical degree at the remarkably young age of 19. The next year, still not yet legally an
							adult, he accompanied Lord Byron on his excursion to Geneva. That Byron quickly tired of his protege's immaturity is well
							known, but Polidori was, indeed, quite young and inexperienced to be in such company.</p>
						<p>Polidori left Switzerland for Italy in September 1816, where he traveled for nearly a year, returning to England the
							following spring, at which point he sought to practice medicine in Norwich. But he was unhappy in his profession and
							thought, instead, of turning to law. In the meantime, perhaps as his own response to the heady literary summer he had
							passed on the continent, he began a short, but productive literary career. His first work was an extension of his interest
							in psychology, An essay on the source of positive pleasure (1818). The following year came a volume of poems -- Ximenes,
							the wreath: and other poems -- the novel Ernestus Berchtold, and the short story, "The Vampyre," which, unfortunately, was
							passed off as the production of Lord Byron when it was published in the New Monthly Magazine. When he found the work being
							published under a separate imprint, Polidori went to some lengths to claim the work as his own, but the scandal of
							imposture dogged him thereafter. His final work, Sketches Illustrative of the Manners and Costumes of France, Switzerland,
							and Italy, was published in 1821 under the pseudonym of Richard Bridgens. That August, purportedly as the result of
							contracting a gambling debt he could not honor, he committed suicide by drinking prussic acid. He was 25 years old. </p>

						<term>MODERN PROMETHEUS</term>
						<p> Prometheus, in one strand of the myth, created human beings from clay, animating them with fire stolen from Zeus. In

							chained to a peak in the Caucasus mountains; there as an emblem of human frustration an eagle daily tore at his liver,
							which was restored by night. Mary Shelley's father, William Godwin, to whom she dedicated her first novel, stressed the
							second of these strands in the section on Prometheus he wrote for his children's book, The Pantheon, or, Ancient History
							of the Gods of Greece and Rome, which he published under the pseudonymn Edward Baldwin in 1806. Mary Shelley's novel
							unifies all strands of the myth in a complex, multifaceted form. Its "modernity" for the second decade of the nineteenth
							century may apply broadly to revolutionary developments in political and scientific arenas over the previous generation
							that transformed the intellectual landscape of Europe. Although in the years intervening since the initial publication of
							Frankenstein, those terms may be thought to have changed radically, the novel's modernity seems to have remained curiously
							unaffected by such shifts in its local application. </p>
						<p> Mary Shelley's husband Percy Bysshe Shelley began his own modernization of the Prometheus legend barely nine months after

							be drawn upon the new publication. Given the opportunity, Mary Shelley was happy to have the chance to polish and, in some
							cases, expand upon her earlier production. Unwittingly, however, in assigning the copyright of her work to the Standard

							real application of genius, rather assumes the appearance of passivity or inertia. Although certainly, Victor's remark
							questions the activities not just of himself but of his auditor, Walton, as well, and thus fits into the overall moral
							rationale for his narration, this blanket reversal of both of their strongest impulses is likely to create a counterthrust

							perhaps the most famous instance of raising the devil in modern literature. Undoubtedly, Mary Shelley had the alchemist
							Johannes Faust in mind in recording the obsessions of Victor Frankenstein. She probably also had heard from Percy Bysshe
							Shelley of his own youthful fantasies toward this end. One example dates from his adolescent years at Eton College: </p>
						<p>One day Mr. Bethell, suspecting from strange noises overhead that his pupil was engaged in nefarious scientific pursuits,
							suddenly appeared in Shelley's rooms; to his consternation he found the culprit apparently half enveloped in a blue flame.

						<p>As at the beginning of the first chapter (I:1:1), the democratic institutions of Switzerland serve Mary Shelley as a foil

					<item n="464">
						<term>republic</term>
						<p>Switzerland was the single self-governing democracy in Europe in the later eighteenth century. Although England sported
							liberal political ideals as a factor distinguishing the nation from the rest of Europe, in practice its long battle
							against the French and Napoleon had fostered a conservative reaction in which "republican" and "jacobin" were virtually
							synonymous terms of opprobrium. This was particularly the case in the years after Waterloo when, without an external enemy
							by which to rally the nation and, experiencing a severe recession as a result of its rapid and radical demobilization, the
							government was fearful of any expression of political dissent and began to prosecute broadly to suppress it. Although
							Victor's emphasis on his family distinction seems a gesture toward the familiar hierarchical structures of English
							society, the fact that the first sentence of the novel as it presents itself ends with so defiant, if understated, an
							assertion of liberal political values indicates the presence of a submerged political viewpoint that observant readers
							will be able to detect throughout the novel. That its contemporary readers would have recognized this aspect of the novel

						<term>resolution</term>
						<p>As with "courage," the martial virtue to which Mary Shelley here yokes "resolution," this word also evokes the

						<p>     how we may henceforth most offend<lb/> Our enemy, our own loss how repair,<lb/> How overcome this dire calamity,<lb/>
							What reinforcement we may gain from hope,<lb/> If not what resolution from despair.<lb/> -- I.187-191</p>

						<p>As understandable as this resolve is (and, perhaps more important to the reader, as necessary to the plot line as it may

						<p>This long passage, almost a tirade, was omitted from the third and later editions. It is one of the clear occasions where

						<term>the heroes of Roncesvalles</term>
						<p>Why Mary Shelley felt it important to alter the legendary materials loved by Clerval is unknown. It may simply be dictated
							by a change in the conditions of her culture. Although Roland, the hero of Roncesvalles, is identical with the title
							character of Ariosto's Orlando Furioso (one of the books specified in 1818), in this rendering Clerval's interest in him
							is more "romantic," less bookish. His other literary passions are of a similar generic kind, rather than for specific
							books. On the other hand, that the Battle of Roncesvalles was fought against Saracen attackers, who are also the
							"infidels" who held the "holy sepulchre" of Jerusalem against the crusaders in Victor's third example of their texts of
							romance, indicates an early manifestation of the interest in eastern, or Mohammedan, culture Clerval will later develop. </p>

						<term>scarlet fever</term>
						<p>A highly contagious disease, usually encountered in childhood, caused by hemolytic streptococus. It is spread through the
							air or through contaminated food, and was virtually untreatable before the development of antibiotics, although penicillin
							and gamma globulin have made it much less common in the twentieth century.</p>
						<p>Scarlet fever's onset is sudden (typically two to seven days after exposure), beginning with a sore throat, shivering, and
							a headache. It develops on the second day into a rash behind the ears, which spreads to the arms and legs. Thomas
							Sydenham, a physician of the late seventeenth century, describes its symptoms thus: "The skin is marked with small, red
							spots, more frequent, more diffuse, and more red than in measles. These last two or three days. They then disappear,
							leaving the skin covered with brawny squamulae [scales], as if powdered with meal." Scarlet fever leaves the glands
							swollen and often sensitive; in some cases, the squamulae on parts of the patient's skin peel off.</p>
						<p>The greatest threats arise from complications. Sinus infections, abcesses of the ear, and mastoiditis are common. In a few
							cases, scarlet fever leads to arthritis, rheumatic fever, or kidney failure.</p>

						<term>schiavi ognor frementi</term>
						<p>Slaves forever in a rage. In her revisions Mary Shelley is betrayed into a historical anachronism, for it was only with the
							Congress of Vienna of 1814-15 that Austria, already given the northeastern section of Italy in 1797, additionally was
							ceded Lombardy. Its capital, Milan, was thereafter a center of subversive unrest, and many of its leading citizens in the
							1820s were convicted of sedition and incarcerated in the infamous Austrian prison of Spielberg. Silvio Pellico's account,
							Le mie prigioni (My Prisons) was published in 1832, the year after the third edition of Frankenstein, and became a
							European best-seller. In the decade and a half following the Congress of Vienna, Britain became a center for exiles from
							the Milanese intelligentsia, among whom was Gabriele Rossetti, father of Christina and Dante Gabriel Rossetti.</p>
						<p>As contemporary English readers might be anticipated almost automatically to sympathize with the plight of a Milanese
							exile, so they would respond to the essentially imperialist ethos of this description of the blond beauty distinguished as
							a "rose among dark-leaved brambles." Both Elizabeth's aristocratic background and her fair northern beauty play to the
							expectations of the main line of British fiction in the early 1830s, what because of its high-bourgeois conventions has
							come to be called "the Silver Fork School." </p>

						<term>Sécheron</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley, her half-sister Claire Clairmont, and Percy had arrived in Sécheron by night on 3 May 1816 and took up
							lodgings at the Hotel d'Angleterre where they remained for more than a month before moving to the opposite side of the
							Lake at Cologny. She noted in a letter of 1 June (published in The History of a Six Weeks' Tour as Letter II) that Geneva

							imposing rank than that. In the terms Walton will employ about his own command in the ensuing letter, the second dignity
							would be, after the captain's lieutenant, the master of the ship (I:L2:3). </p>

					<item n="490">
						<term>secret stores of knowledge</term>
						<p>This language resonates beyond the fictional world of this novel and links in complex ways with the concerns of Percy
							Bysshe Shelley, who likewise focuses on this theme in "Alastor" (lines 20-23, 75-82, and 116-28), where both the narrator
							and the Poet whose story he tells are obsessed with uncovering secret lore; in the "Hymn to Intellectual Beauty," stanza
							5, where Shelley recounts his own youthful investment in the supernatural; and in "Mont Blanc," esp. ll. 139-41, where the
							mountain itself is represented as holding secrets the poet would penetrate. "Alastor" was published in March of 1816, and
							the other two poems were written that summer. In addition, the theme is continually sounded in The Revolt of Islam, the
							long narrative poem he composed while Mary Shelley was simultaneously writing Frankenstein: (see esp. Canto II, sts.
							11-12, 20; Canto IV, sts. 3, 6-8, 12). There Shelley gives a strong political tilt to the notion of suppressed knowledge. </p>

					<item n="491">
						<term>self-educated</term>
						<p>The terms of Walton's education are provided in I:L2:2, where he laments his neglect of systematic preparation in his
							youth. It will remain to be seen in the course of the novel whether Victor Frankenstein's more formal education served him
							better than did Walton's autodidacticism.</p>
						<p> The question of self-education would have resonated strongly in the Shelley household. Mary Shelley did not attend school
							and was largely educated by her father, who in his early years had tried to read everything that was written and therefore
							was presumably qualified in the highest terms to direct his daughter's intellectual development. Though her husband
							attended the finest of preparatory schools, Syon House and Eton College, P. B. Shelley was expelled from Oxford in his
							second term at the university and thereafter amassed his considerable learning on his own. Mary, it should be stressed,
							embarked on a similar reading program as her husband and, if still only eighteen when she began Frankenstein was, by the
							standards of woman's education in her day, prodigiously learned. </p>

						<term>so expressive of sensibility and sweetness</term>
						<p>The description of Elizabeth, needless to say, is taken from stock; but it is likewise defining of her later personality.
							For the many critics troubled by the way women are portrayed in this novel, her stereotypical femininity, composed of a
							sweet temper and refined imaginativeness, gives her no role to play in a male-dominated culture but that of a potential
							victim of its dynamics. </p>

					<item n="494">
						<term>Do you share my madness</term>
						<p>As with other additions made by Mary Shelley in the early pages of her novel, this renders more explicit the extent to
							which Victor Frankenstein and Robert Walton share much the same passion for knowledge. Their seeming differences are
							really superficial, accounted for by the terrible cost experience has wrought on Victor and the sheltered innocence in
							which Walton has been protected. Mary Shelley here likewise strengthens her plot line, giving Victor Frankenstein a strong
							reason for bestowing the terrible moral of his autobiography upon the enthusiastic explorer, allowing him, too, to be the
							first to indicate that he might be mad. By questioning Walton's sanity as well, he opens up large problems of reliability
							that the subsequent narrative will exploit. </p>

					<item n="495">
						<term>She died on the first approach of cold weather</term>
						<p>Justine is orphaned pointedly about the same time (the previous November) that Victor Frankenstein gives life to his
							Creature, who is, like Justine, an unwanted dependant. Unlike every other character in the novel, however, the Creature is
							cut adrift from family protection not by death, but by a lack of human responsibility for his nurture. Born in abnormal
							circumstances, he is without family, wholly unaccommodated in an alien world. Where Alphonse Frankenstein virtually adopts
							Justine, his son rejects the Creature he has fashioned. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="497">
						<term>she was induced to give her an education</term>
						<p>In a novel so concerned with education this emphasis on Justine's advancement testifies to Mary Shelley's belief in its

							reflects as well the strong democratic sentiments that Mary Shelley shared with her husband. It is important to remember
							that, under her father's tutelege, Mary Godwin enjoyed an education that in her day was equalled by only a handful of

					<item n="498">
						<term>she whom we saw every day</term>
						<p>In the early months after Mary Godwin and Percy Bysshe Shelley returned to England they were both afflicted with the deaths

							suicide. A month later Harriet Shelley, P. B. Shelley's legal wife, drowned herself in the Serpentine River in Hyde Park.

					<item n="500">
						<term>shunned</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley's brief addition in 1831 emphasizes the extremity of psychological state that lies behind Victor's critical

					<item n="501">
						<term>silent as a Turk</term>
						<p>In the early nineteenth century Turkey was the center of the far-flung Ottoman Empire, which was to an English readership

							presence in India and Afghanistan, making it a natural object of suspicion and prejudice. Whether Mary Shelley thought
							twice about the terms of her analogy here one cannot know, but it is a fact that Turks do not fare well in this novel. In
							its second volume (II:6:12) Safie's father acts an ungenerous and even treacherous role. </p>

						<p>To facilitate his creation Victor has recourse to animal parts and tissues from the abattoir. What Victor thus rightly

						<term>snow and frost are banished</term>
						<p>Fanciful representations of the North Pole as an edenic clime, however nonsensical they might appear in the light of modern
							science, are fairly common in early mythology. Percy Bysshe Shelley, writing contemporaneously with Frankenstein, stages
							part of the first canto of The Revolt of Islam in such a polar paradise derived from Indian sources. The oxymoronic
							combination of fire and ice is a conspicuous feature of the edenic paradise of Xanadu in Coleridge's "Kubla Khan,"
							published in 1816 and read that summer in the Geneva circle as Mary Shelley began writing Frankenstein. A strongly ironic
							version of this coexistence of opposites informs the Creature's plans for his self-destruction in the penultimate
							paragraph of the novel (III:WC:47). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="507">
						<term>so astonishing a secret</term>
						<p>Although the term sounds innocent at first reading, we may be reminded here of the "secret stores of knowledge" ("secrets

							shared by all modern scientific discourse on open inquiry and testing results of experimentation in a court of learned
							opinion. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="508">
						<term>some terrible idea</term>
						<p>No other account of the writing contest verifies this bizarre project as Mary Shelley outlines it. Polidori himself, in the
							introduction to his realistic novel Ernestus Berchtold; or, the Modern Oedipus 1819), identified that work as the one he
							began as the response to the challenge given by Lord Byron. He did, however, also produce a horror-story of his own in
							direct competition with Byron's unfinished fragment, which he published in 1819 as The Vampyre; a Tale. </p>

					<item n="510">
						<term>so much depravity and ingratitude</term>
						<p>It would seem more than coincidental that the father would invoke a concept (depravity) that entered the arena of this
							novel only the night before, upon the son's once again catching sight of his Creature, "a depraved wretch" (I:6:23 and

						<p>This second son is Ernest, an even more shadowy figure in the 1831 text than in the first edition. He appears to exist

						<p>This is a curious statement for Victor to make, perhaps indicative of how tenuous a hold he has on reality at this point.

						<p>Although the description here is intended to be amusing and to reflect an adolescent student's viewpoint of his elder,

							perspectives are implicitly molded by aesthetic criteria. By this standard the Creature whom Victor will create in his
							laboratory becomes a proof text for every figure who depends upon sight for knowledge. Even if familiarity, in the case of
							Victor Frankenstein, allows him in time to overlook the ugliness of Professor Krempe or of the Creature while in the
							process of his construction, it is clear from the repetitive emphasis on Krempe's size that Victor has an aversion to

						<term>St. Petersburgh</term>
						<p>In the opening decade of the eighteenth century Czar Peter the Great decided to build a new capital city for imperial
							Russia and picked for his site the swampy estuary of the Neva River where it flowed into the Baltic Sea. There he built
							the city named after his patron saint, officially establishing it as his capital in 1712. The extraordinary dimensions of
							this achievement were still retailed with awe by the end of the century when the 4th edition of the Encyclopaedia
							Brittanica (1797) dwelt at length on the founding of St. Petersburg. Only in the second half of the century, however, did
							it achieve the grandiose dimensions we now associate with the city. The major impetus to its development was the building
							of the Winter Palace, the official home of the Czars of Russia, begun by Peter III in 1754. In a palace coup that seems to
							have been universally praised, the Czar's wife Catherine seized power from Peter III in 1762, inaugurating the development
							of Russia into a modern and formidable nation. German by birth, Catherine aspired to make her country not just a major
							European political power but, more, one of its principal cultural centers. In her thirty-four years on the imperial throne
							she amassed an extraordinary collection of art to supplement and eventually supplant the Dutch-Flemish collection of Peter
							the Great: beginning in 1764. She had the fancifully named but grandly outfitted Hermitage built to house these treasures.
							Likewise, she gathered a major library of over 30,000 books, whose crowning glory was the acquisition of the entire
							library of Voltaire after his death in 1778. In his later years he had been a frequent correspondent with Catherine, as
							was Denis Diderot, the leading figure in creating for the French Enlightenment a compendium of all that was known, the
							Encyclopédie. Diderot became her chief advisor on the acquisition of art and in 1774 was himself persuaded to remove to
							St. Petersburg where he had the singular duty of providing Catherine with an hour of learned conversation every afternoon.
							Autocrat that she was, by the end of her life in 1796 Catherine had repented of her patronage of the leading philosophical
							forces that had spawned the French Revolution.</p>
						<p>That the novel is first set in St. Petersburg may be, then, not a mere curiosity, but a careful signal of its intellectual
							and cultural dimensions. Through it the reader of Mary Shelley's novel is to understand that it begins intellectually
							where it stands geographically, in the shadow of Catherine's enlightenment vision of a modernized culture. Robert Walton's
							thrilling sense of scientific discovery, detailed throughout this first letter, and Victor Frankenstein's endeavor to
							create a new being both share that ambience. The open question subtly articulated by this initial postmark is whether the
							dream of the new city or of the new human can alter the conditions that have determined the old. Will the novel, like

							contrast to Victor's nostalgic memory of an indulged childhood, the Creature experiences no parental kindness whatsoever
							and must begin life from an existential nadir. In doing so, he is forced to educate himself exactly in the elements of

						<p>Walton's highly refined sense of good manners here keeps him from inquiring about what had brought Victor to this desolate

							tone here, as there was in his earlier description of the sailors with whom he had to consort (I:L2:3, I:L2:4). Of course,
							it might be argued that the class system that so rigidly divided a ship's officers and its crew resulted in just such a
							dichotomy: it is not to the crew that Victor will retail his painful autobiography, but rather to a person of social
							breeding and intellectual ambition, if not education, comparable to his own. On the other hand, it could be maintained
							that the tone here is wholly unintentional, an unwitting reflection of the residual bourgeois tonality that Mary Shelley
							occasionally betrays in her contemporary publication, A History of a Six Weeks' Tour, when confronted with what she

						<p>Although it dates from June 1818, and thus postdates the publication of the first edition of Frankenstein by several

							attitude to her adolescent student's disenchantment with a philosophical discipline that deconstructs rather than creates:</p>
						<p>Philosophy, impatient as it may be to build, has much work yet remaining as pioneer* for the overgrowth of ages. It makes
							one step towards this object; it destroys error, and the roots of error. It leaves, what is too often the duty of the
							reformer in political and ethical questions to leave, a vacancy.# It reduces the mind to that freedom in which it would
							have acted, but for the misuse of words and signs, the instruments of its own creation. —By signs, I would be understood
							in a wide sense, including what is properly meant by that term, and what I peculiarly mean. In this latter sense almost
							all familiar objects are signs, standing not for themselves but for others, in their capacity of suggesting one thought,
							which shall lead to a train of thoughts. —Our whole life is thus an education of error. (Reiman-Powers, eds., Shelley's

						<p>Mary Shelley here suggestively reveals that Victor's self-education involves no sense of social responsibility for the

							increasingly be seen to have implications for the veracity of the narrative, since, after such a pattern of evasion

						<term>trader</term>
						<p>This unattractive portrait of Henry Clerval's father relies on common prejudices of British society in the early nineteenth

							Johnson offers two definitions for "trader" in his 1755 Dictionary: </p>
						<p> 1.One engaged in merchandise or commerce.<lb/> 2.One long used in the methods of money getting; a practitioner.</p>
						<p>The same tone insinuates itself into cognate definitions: Trade </p>
						<p> 1.Traffick; commerce; exchange of goods for other goods, or for money.<lb/> 2.Occupation; particular employment whether
							manual or mercantile, distinguished from the liberal arts or learned professions.<lb/> 3. Instruments of any
							occupation.<lb/> 4. Any employment not manual; habitual exercise.</p>
						<p>To trade</p>

						<p>This is the first indication of the age of a character in the novel, but a careful tracing of its chronology would prove

							expectations. From this moment on his joy will never again be "unbridled," but rather, at best, what Thomas Gray, in his
							"Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College," called "fearful." </p>
						<p> Some bold adventurers disdain<lb/> The limits of their little reign,<lb/> And unknown regions dare descry:<lb/> Still as

						<p>Although Clerval seems lighthearted in his exaggeration, his phrasing resonates with startling irony. Not only does it play

							but the diction, so like the language of Walton's first letter (I:L1:2), reminds us that Walton himself would not be an

						<term>University of Ingolstadt</term>
						<p>The University of Ingolstadt was opened on 26 July 1472 under the patronage of the Duke of Bavaria, Ludwig the Wealthy. For
							centuries its various faculties—humanistic, scientific, theology, law, and medicine—were contained in the Hoheschule (High
							School). By the end of the seventeenth century plans were elaborated for new university buildings, but these were never
							realized. Nonetheless, during the ensuing century the University was forced to expand. In 1760 George Ludwig Claudius
							Rousseau was appointed demonstrator of Chemistry, and in 1778 a separate laboratory was constructed for him near the
							Hoheschule. Given the time scheme of Frankenstein, it seems likely that Victor would have pursued his studies in that
							location.</p>
						<p>But Ingolstadt was also very well equipped to support Victor's more elaborate scientific ambitions. From the first, the
							University possessed a medical school of stature. In 1722 its faculty acquired a site for a projected school that would
							incorporate an anatomy theater, botanical garden, and chemistry laboratory, and construction was begun early in 1723
							though, for want of money, it was not wholly finished until 1736. A major botanical garden was attached to the school to
							support its experiments and treatments. By 1755 the demonstration hall in the central atrium had been converted into a
							two-story anatomical theater, with a dissecting table on the ground floor, a gallery for student observers above, and a
							glass ceiling allowing overhead illumination. In the later eighteenth century it was considered to be one of the finest
							such theaters in Europe. Obviously, such a theater would have had ample provision for the specimens required for teaching
							purposes—or for clandestine experimentation. </p>

						<term>unparalleled eloquence</term>
						<p>Later Walton calls Frankenstein's eloquence "forcible and touching" (III:WC:6) and just three weeks after the present
							letter the crew will witness its effect (III:WC:17). But on that occasion the crew will not be swayed by Victor; and even
							Victor himself, somewhat earlier, evinced himself as distrustful of mere eloquence, warning Walton against the power of
							the Creature's speech and suggesting that it might mislead him (III:7:26).</p>
						<p>Eloquence as a concept implicitly assumes multiple perspectives and an underlying uncertainty as to where truth resides. It
							is thus focussed as a highly vexed issue in the novel, which reveals itself to be at once selfconscious in its employment
							of manipulative rhetoric and suspicious of the effects. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="569">
						<term>unremitting ardour</term>
						<p>Another way to define "unremitting ardour" would be, from the linguistic root, a perpetual low-grade fever. The damage to

						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="570">
						<term>Study had . . . rendered me unsocial</term>
						<p>Since study is itself customarily thought to be a passive occupation, Victor's employment of the passive mood here calls
							our immediate attention to his unwillingness to accept responsibility for a driving obsession. We have seen a like usage
							earlier (I:3:3 and note). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="571">
						<term>until the decline of life that he thought of marrying</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley seems to have an adolescent's sense of what constitutes the "decline of life." When we are introduced to
							Alphonse Frankenstein, a man who remained unmarried for at least another two years after his decision to wed and and who
							then had three children across a timespan of sixteen years, he seems as yet not to have begun the decline attributed to
							him here. His delay in marriage is shared by Victor who finds numerous reasons for postponing his nuptials with Elizabeth
							Lavenza. That this is a family trait Mary Shelley wishes to accentuate rather than the reflection of some antiromantic
							convention of her own or of her time is indicated by the case of Felix De Lacey, who falls deeply in love at a young age. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="572">
						<term>an unwillingness to leave Clerval</term>
						<p>At this point Clerval has been in Ingolstadt for a full year. Some months earlier, as the previous paragraph indicates, he
							had been introduced by Victor to the "several professors of the university." Here, as elsewhere (I:3:10), Mary Shelley
							quietly underscores the ease with which Victor shirks his family duties. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="573">
						<term>vacancy</term>
						<p>There is an unmistakeably strong resonance here of the final lines of Percy Bysshe Shelley's "Mont Blanc," lines 139ff.,
							written during the summer of 1816 when Frankenstein was begun. Since the early chapters were conceived at this time, the
							reflection of this particular poem would seem purposeful. That the greater part of Volume 2 of the novel takes place below
							Mt. Blanc should reinforce the sense one has of a thematic kinship between these two works. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="574">
						<term>my own vampire</term>
						<p>So entwined are the fortunes of Victor Frankenstein's Creature and vampires in twentieth-century popular culture, that to
							many it comes as a shock to realize that Bram Stoker's Dracula dates from three-quarters of a century after Mary Shelley's
							novel. And yet, the subject matters were entwined from the beginning. The story that Lord Byron vowed to produce for the
							Gothic competition of the summer of 1816 was to be called The Vampyre. In the end he dropped it, and the account was
							picked up and finished by John Polidori, Byron's personal physician during this summer, who then published his novella
							with the same title as that used by Byron so as to increase its circulation.</p>
						<p>Vampires were rather new on the literary scene at this point: general legendary knowledge about them actually stemmed from
							a single source, the incorporation of a vampire in Robert Southey's exotic and very popular oriental romance, Thalaba the
							Destroyer (1801). Although the figure appears in only one stanza, it afforded Southey the opportunity to show off his
							learning in a ten-page note. Since Percy Shelley was greatly enamored of this poem, even reading it aloud to Mary and
							Claire Clairmont on successive evenings in September 1814, there is little doubt that Mary had this account in mind in
							drawing upon vampire imagery for Frankenstein. </p>

					</item>
					<item n="575">
						<term>vaults and charnel houses</term>
						<p>Johnson in his 1755 Dictionary defines a charnel house as "The place under churches where the bones of the dead are
							reposited" and a vault as simply "a repository for the dead." By the latter Victor Frankenstein probably means to
							distinguish a mausoleum. Body-snatching or grave-robbing, a means of supplying cadavers for medical experiments and
							instruction, was a source of great anxiety in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It was, of course, a criminal
							activity. </p>

						<term>it began to move with voluntary motion</term>
						<p>This constitutes something of a misreading of the kinds of experiments Erasmus Darwin recounts in the first of his
							Additional Notes—"Spontaneous Vitality of Microscopic Animals"—appended to The Temple of Nature. Probably Mary Shelley is
							taking figuratively, as a kind of macaroni, the literal meaning of "vermicelli," tiny worms—what Darwin calls "microscopic
							animalcules." Still, although she humorously exaggerates the kind of spontaneous generation that drew scientific
							speculation in the early years of the nineteenth century, it is important to recognize how seriously such experiments were
							taken. Here, for instance, is the initial sentence of Darwin's "Conclusion": </p> {8} There is therefore no absurdity in
						believing that the most simple animals and vegetables may be produced by the congress of the parts of decomposing organic
						matter, without what can properly be termed generation, as the genus did not previously exist; which accounts for the endless
						varieties, as well as for the immense numbers of microscopic animals.<p>Percy Bysshe Shelley also cites Erasmus Darwin in the

						<p>Victor's characteristic passive verb construction reasserts itself here, in circumstances where, since he has been out of

							mood does suggest his sense that he is trapped without a means of exonerating a person he is certain is innocent. At the

						<p>In keeping with the tenor of this paragraph, the sentence bears a double freight. On the one hand, one could see Elizabeth

							On the other hand, as we have witnessed in the previous two chapters, a human being can become so inured to those darker

						<term>William</term>
						<p>Mary Shelley's infant son (b. 24 January 1816) was named William after her father. Her arranging to have his namesake in
							the novel murdered has prompted some wonder. Certainly, there was no lack of maternal affection: William Shelley's death
							in Rome on 7 June 1819 was a devastating blow to Mary Shelley, issuing in something approaching a nervous breakdown. </p>

						<p>At this point in the novel William is about seven years old. He is clearly modeled in this description on Mary's infant son
							William. </p>

						<term>I have communicated to him without disguise</term>
						<p>Candor is an important character trait in the novel, and it is to Walton's credit that he so naturally evinces it. His
							openness will elicit a similar frankness from Victor Frankenstein, who for the first time in his existence will tell his
							entire story. But that narration, then, raises a serious problem. Not only are there many signs of instability in it, the
							major one being Victor's wish to revise it even as it goes along (III:WC:4 and note); but his earlier lack of candor with
							his family and friends is akin to dishonesty, which, if so common a practice throughout his mature life, must raise
							serious doubts about the truthfulness of the narration that comprises the bulk of this novel. </p>

						<term>wondrous power</term>
						<p>The "wondrous power" is magnetism. Mary Shelley, working within the accepted scientific discourse of her time, in this
							second paragraph of her novel, is carefully establishing a conceptual—the term in her time would have been
							"philosophical"—base for it in physics. The key is provided by Percy Bysshe Shelley's citation, in the opening sentence of
							the Preface (I:Pref:1), of Erasmus Darwin, to whom the reader may turn for further elucidation of the scientific grounding
							of the novel. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="601">
						<term>my workshop of filthy creation</term>
						<p>This phrase recurs with frequency in the critical literature about the novel, partly because it stands in such contrast to
							the almost divine attributes with which Victor has up to now been honoring himself and his discovery. In the phrase there
							is not only a sense of the irreducibly brute physical reality of what would have actually constituted a butcher-shop but
							as well a decided undertone of self-loathing. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="602">
						<term>worthy of my parentage</term>
						<p>However odd this may sound to contemporary ears, it is certainly true that Percy Bysshe Shelley deeply romanticized Mary's
							origins, seeing her as singled out by her birth for great literary accomplishment. He pays tribute to her in these terms
							in his Dedication to The Revolt of Islam, the epic-romance he wrote simultaneously with her composition of Frankenstein.
							Although some commentators have seen the pressures to write to which her lover/husband subjected Mary Shelley as
							pernicious, it did not originate with him so much as in the milieu in which Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin was raised. There,
							writing (William Godwin) and publishing (Mary Jane Clairmont, his second wife) was what one did. </p>

						<term>wretch</term>
						<p>The Creature has been "named" once before by Victor, in the prologue, as "daemon" (I:L4:16). The nomenclature in which he
							is vested confers an initial identity upon him that will shift overnight from this enigmatic term of alienation—meaning
							either being unhappy or vile (from the Old English word for "exile")—to the wholly out of bounds, the monstrous (I:4:3). </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="604">
						<term>wretchedly</term>
						<p>Here we encounter the first, ironic sign of Victor's bonding with his Creature. He first called him a "wretch" in the
							second paragraph of this chapter (I:4:2), and has just reiterated the epithet two sentences before this. Victor's adverb
							may seem innocent enough, but when juxtaposed with the many instances later in the novel in which he and his Creature will
							exchange places or nomenclature, it functions as a clear opening signal of the complex narrative patterning to come. </p>
						<p/>
					</item>
					<item n="605">
						<term>wretch—the miserable monster</term>
						<p>Here what had been ambiguous in the earlier use of the word "wretch" (I:4:2) hardens into monstrosity, a condition beyond
							the realm of the human. By the end of the paragraph the Creature, in Victor's view, will once more transmogrify into a
							further dimension of estrangement, the supernatural. </p>

						<term>a young girl</term>
						<p>Age is always relative. Mary Shelley was some two months shy of her twentieth birthday when she began writing Frankenstein
							and well past twenty-one when the novel appeared in print. Moreover, before she began the novel toward the end of June
							1816, she had registered experiences highly unusual for a young woman in the constrained environment of Britain, including
							eloping with a married man and twice giving birth. That said, it is true that the author was in years yet an adolescent
							when she wrote this novel and that, historically speaking, most of its readers have been struck by a range of knowledge,
							maturity of conception, and intellectual ambition unusual in one so young. </p>
						<p/>

					<item n="607">
						<term>your gentle and feminine fosterage</term>
						<p>This addition to the text seems motivated by a wish to make Margaret Saville a less shadowy presence behind it. The
							implicit suggestion is that she is sufficiently older than her brother to have cared for him when they were orphaned,
							though, considering the twin facts that she has children in her own family and Robert is now 28 years old, we must assume
							that the difference in age would amount to something like a decade (III:WC:11). The added phrase also emphasizes the role
							of feminine nurturer assumed by all the prominent women of the novel. </p>

						<term>you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own hand-writing</term>
						<p>However varied the reasons might be for the phenomenon, Frankenstein continually reverts to the importance of documentary
							evidence to substantiate the truth of its events or assertions. This will be seen as crucial in the case of the Creature's
							existence and experiences (see II:6:7), of Victor's rectitude as a narrator (see III:WC:2), even of Walton's day-to-day
							account of his voyage (likewise contained in letters "in [his] own handwriting"). The pattern suggests that what is at
							stake here is the underlying truth of all fictions. </p>
