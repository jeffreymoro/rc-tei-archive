                                dated July 1804, it was composed shortly after Tighe left Ireland for England to seek treatment for her failing health. The hot springs
                                emerging from the rocks beneath the Avon river at Bristol's Hotwells (depicted in the illustration) were never quite as popular as the spas at
                                Bath.</note>

               <l>From the rocks of S<hi rendition="#sup">t</hi> Vincent resounded no more.</l>

               <l>Now wearied with watching, exhausted by pain,</l>
               <l>Aurora with pity beheld me complain,</l>
               <l>With her fresh, dewy wand light-sprinkling my breast,</l>
               <l>"Poor sufferer," she whisper'd, "at length thou shalt rest.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>From her train of sweet slumbers, and truth-giving dreams,</l>
               <l>She takes a soft veil to oppose her strong beams,</l>
               <l>The kind welcome gift o'er my pillow suspends,</l>
               <l>And at once every sense of uneasiness ends.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Its weight of oppression no more loads my breast,</l>

               <l>While a form all celestial appears to my view</l>
               <l>Array'd in bright silver, and heav'nly blue.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Her locks of pure amber with roses were bound,</l>
               <l>Such roses ne'er glow'd on terrestrial ground;</l>
               <l>But inhal'd the rich dews of ambrosia above,</l>
               <l>Where Spring is eternal, unfading is Love.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>On her light, graceful form with enchantment I gaz'd,</l>
               <l>And methought was so charm'd, that I scarce felt amaz'd,</l>
               <l>For attraction, and tenderness liv'd in her sight,</l>
               <l>Her voice was persuasion, her eye was delight.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But her smile, Oh, what words can the magic impart,</l>
               <l>Which taught her soft smile the swift road to the heart?</l>
               <l>When the gates of pure coral dividing awhile,</l>
               <l>Their rich, pearly treasures display'd by a smile.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus, extending her hand, as all radiant she smil'd,</l>
               <l>While her brow brightly beam'd with benevolence mild,</l>
               <l>"Droop no longer," she cried, "thou poor fading flower"</l>
               <l>"But receive my embrace, and revive from this hour."</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>As she bent o'er my pillow with peace-giving air,</l>
               <l>A white rose gently shower'd its light leaves from her hair;<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Tighe's note: "A white rose &amp;c] In allusion to
                                the rose lozenges which were the first gift of that kind friend, in whose lovely form the Spirit of Health then appear'd." </note>
               </l>
               <l>"They are thine," she exclaim'd, "they will yield thee repose,"</l>
               <l>And she breath'd on them fragrance more sweet than the rose.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then clasp'd in her arms she embrac'd me benign,</l>
               <l>And health seem'd reviv'd in the pressure divine,</l>
               <l>Methought its mild influence new life could impart,</l>
               <l>And remove the oppression that heav'd on my heart.</l>

               <l>O'er her bosom more white than the down of a swan,</l>
               <l>A blue scarf of soft texture was gracefully drawn,</l>
               <l>Its virtues and warmth it had stolen from her breast,</l>
               <l>By kindness 'twas woven, by health it was blest.</l>
