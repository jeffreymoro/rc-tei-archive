               <l>Oh Florence! dearest Love! I have bid thee then Adieu!</l>
               <l>And all my hopes and pleasures thy parting steps pursue,</l>
               <l>Yet something love has gain'd to cheer me tho' we part</l>
               <l>And the kiss he<note place="foot" resp="editors"> "He" refers to love.</note> then allow'd me still thrills upon my heart:</l>
               <l>Oh yet methinks I see thee as on that fatal day</l>
               <l>When my faltering lips refus'd the last farewell to say;</l>
               <l>Love whisper'd to my hopes as thine hand I trembling held</l>
               <l>That its soft and gentle pressure kind sympathy reveal'd,</l>
               <l>While Memory, delighted each image to retrace,</l>
               <l>Recalls each varied look of that mild expressive face;</l>
               <l>Each word that there was utter'd, most forcibly imprest</l>
               <l>With the accent, and the voice seem graven on my breast;</l>
               <l>Yet beams upon my soul that soft enchanting glance,</l>
               <l>As pensive and alone she saw me first advance;</l>
               <l>I see the dew of Love just glisten in her eye,</l>
               <l>And her bosom gently swell with the stifled, tender sigh:</l>
               <l>Oh rapture breathing sigh! inestimable tear!</l>
               <l>Which first could whisper hope that to Florence I was dear.</l>
               <l>Oh! moment still most priz'd, that embolden'd me to seek</l>
               <l>With lips too fondly daring her half averted cheek!</l>
               <l>The sweet electric force which shot thro' every nerve</l>
               <l>In fond remembrance cherish'd I carefully preserve;</l>
               <l>Yet half afraid I view the anger and surprise</l>
               <l>Which arm'd with transient light'ning the lustre of her eyes;</l>
               <l>I see the mantling roses yet glow upon her face,</l>
               <l>The deep celestial blush that doubl'd every grace;</l>

               <l>Not half I priz'd the treasure thus snatched with trembling joy,</l>
               <l>'Till tenderness return'd to her pardon-beaming eye;</l>
               <l>Nor vain was my repentance that bad her anger cease</l>
               <l>And bless her sorrowing lover, and let him part in peace:</l>
               <l>I see the tender smile, &amp; still methinks I feel</l>
               <l>That hand so soft extended my pardon bid to seal;</l>
               <l>The orders to depart Oh! yet too well I hear,</l>
               <l>And the cruel word farewell still vibrates in my ear,</l>
               <l>That pause of silent sorrow, that look of parting love,</l>
               <l>From my heart the dear ideas Ah never can remove!</l>

               <l>Yet thine image still is here, it soothes me as I mourn,</l>
               <l>And smiles as thou, my Florence! wilt smile on thy return.</l>
               <l>It looks with that complacence which thou wert wont to shew,</l>
               <l>And rich is blest remembrance kind pictures to bestow,</l>
               <l>It paints the future prospects with Hope's most brilliant hue</l>
               <l>And tells me that my Florence will evermore be true. </l>
