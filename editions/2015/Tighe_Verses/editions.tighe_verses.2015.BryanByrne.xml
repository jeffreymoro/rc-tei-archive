                            of Bryan Byrne is founded upon facts which were related to the author in the autumn of 1798: though circumstances may not have happened in the
                            exact manner which is recorded in the poem, yet it gives but too faithful a picture of the sentiments and conduct of those days. It is certain that
                            at that period several unarmed persons, report says above twenty, were put to death by the troops near Wicklow, to retaliate the murder of many
                            loyalists, and particularly of the three brothers mentioned in this ballad” (314).</note>
