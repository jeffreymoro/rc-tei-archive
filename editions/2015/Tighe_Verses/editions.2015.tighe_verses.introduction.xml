                    <p> This electronic edition makes available a tremendous archival deposit: Mary Tighe's <title level="m">Verses Transcribed for H.T.</title> (1805), a
                        266-page two-volume bound autograph manuscript collection of 121 original Tighe poems and 72 original Tighe illustrations the National Library of
                        Ireland acquired in 2004 (MS 49,155/2). Tighe began transcribing and illustrating <title level="m">Verses</title> as she was contemplating the
                        publication of a volume of poetry that would feature her epic romance "Psyche; or, the Legend of Love" accompanied by a selection of her lyrics, a
                        project her husband Henry Tighe (H.T.) and friends such as Thomas Moore urged her to pursue while she was in England seeking treatment for a
                        consumptive cough from June 1804 to August 1805. Generally averse to commercial publication, but happy to circulate her work among the members of her
                        various literary coteries,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Tighe shared her work with an extended network of family, friends, and literary
                            acquaintances in Ireland, Wales, and England, including Joseph Atkinson, John Blachford, Theodosia Blachford, Henrietta Bowdler, Henry Boyd, Lady
                            Eleanor Butler, Catherine Maria Fanshawe, William Hayley, Alicia LeFanu, Henry Moore, Thomas Moore, Hannah More, Sydney Owenson/Lady Morgan,
                            William Parnell, Sarah Ponsonby, William Roscoe, Anna Seward, Charlotte Smith, Caroline Tighe Hamilton, Elizabeth Tighe Kelly, George Tighe, Sarah
                            Tighe, William Tighe, Barbarina Wilmot/Lady Dacre, Joseph Cooper Walker, John Wesley and others (Linkin, "Mary Tighe and the Coterie of Women Poets
                            in Psyche," 303-04).</note> Tighe opted to print 50 copies of <title level="m">Psyche; or, The Legend of Love</title> (1805) without any additions
                        from <title level="m">Verses</title> in a small private edition that she dedicated and distributed to family and friends. That private edition of
                            <title level="m">Psyche; or, The Legend of Love</title> made Tighe famous: hundreds of enthusiastic readers borrowed and shared copies of the poem
                        (often making their own manuscript copies and thereby increasing the poem's circulation). Although readers and critics frequently recommended the
                        publication of <title level="m">Psyche</title>, and Tighe found the calls to publish flattering, she remained a coterie poet till the end of her days.
                        Had she only pursued the larger project urged by Henry Tighe and Thomas Moore in 1804-1805, she would have prepared her own version of what became the
                        subsequently posthumous edition of <title level="m">Psyche, with Other Poems</title> that her family published with the Longman group in 1811. That
                        edition offered a carefully culled selection of 29 lyrics from the 120 in <title level="m">Verses</title> as well as another 10 lyrics not included in
                            <title level="m">Verses</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The ten lyrics from <title level="m">Psyche, with Other Poems</title> not
                            included in <title level="m">Verses</title> are "Written in a Copy of Psyche which had been in the library of C. J. Fox. April, 1809," "To the
                            Memory of Margaret Tighe, Taken from Us June 7th, 1804, Etat 85," "Written for Her Niece S. K.," "To Fortune, From Metastasio," "The Shawl's
                            Petition, To Lady Asgill," "To Lady Charlemont, in Return for Her Presents of Flowers, March, 1808," "Hagar in the Desert," "The Lily, May, 1809,"
                            "Sonnet Written at Woodstock, in the County Kilkenny, the Seat of William Tighe, June 30, 1809," and "On Receiving a Branch of Mezereon Which
                            Flowered at Woodstock, December, 1809."</note> The multiple printings of <title level="m">Psyche, with Other Poems</title> established Tighe's
                        literary reputation for good and ill throughout the nineteenth and twentieth century, bringing her notable attention for <title level="m"
                            >Psyche</title>, but barely hinting at the lyric range of the "Other Poems" displayed in <title level="m">Verses</title>.<note place="foot"

                    <p> A beautifully and self-consciously constructed aesthetic artifact, <title level="m">Verses Transcribed for H.T.</title> radically revises our prior
                        knowledge of Tighe's literary, visual, and material production:
                    <list type="unordered">

                        <item>17 of the 121 poems contain significant variants from the published versions; </item>
                        <item>72 of the 121 poems are illustrated with elegant tailpieces that cast light on the poems they illuminate and provide a visual travelogue of the

                            of the 15 that are printed in the novel; </item>
                        <item>dozens attest to Tighe's full-scale engagement with contemporary poetics and politics: the discourse of sensibility, Della Cruscan poetry,
                            coterie culture, the sonnet revival, Romantic antiquarianism, the 1794 Treason Trials, the 1798 Irish Rebellion, the 1801 Act of Union, and
                            more.</item>
                    </list>
                    <title level="m">Verses</title> reveals a Tighe we have never seen: beyond the new poems it introduces to literary history, beyond the new information
                        it provides about the dates, places, and sources of already published poems, beyond the images it makes visible, it presents Mary Tighe as the
                        determining editor of her own collected poems.</p>
                    <p> Tighe arranges the lyrics in <title level="m">Verses</title> in clusters or sets of poetic experiences, unlike the genre-based structure of <title
                            level="m">Psyche, with Other Poems</title> (epic, sonnets, occasional lyrics), or the chronological structure of the lyrics presented in <title
                            level="m">Mary, a Series of Reflections During Twenty Years</title>, a second privately printed posthumous family edition of Tighe's lyrics that
                        appeared in 1811 (with lyrics written between 1789 and 1809).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Like <title level="m">Psyche, with Other Poems</title>
                            the identity of <title level="m">Mary</title>'s editor is unknown. Only two of the twenty copies have been located to date, at the National Library
                            of Ireland and Harvard.</note> And she foregrounds her representation of herself as a poet articulating the dilemmas of Petrarchan desire, versus
                        the sober classical scholar mourned in <title level="m">Psyche</title> or the spiritually redeemed soul elegized in <title level="m">Mary</title>.
                        Volume I begins with a set of coterie poems that include poems of friendship and poems of sorrow, moves nearly seamlessly to the poems from or for the
                        characters in <title level="m">Selena</title>, and concludes with a firmly designated section of sonnets. Volume II dramatically shifts from the more
                        internal gaze of the sonnets to the more external gaze of a series of poems concerned with history, politics, and the world, then presents an extended
                        section of continental translations, and ends with a return to more personal poems (interspersed with additional translations). Although many of the
                        poems towards the end of the second volume date from the latter period of Tighe's life (1804 on), including six written after the 1805 title page
                        inscription, the careful juxtaposition of earlier poems from the late 1790s and early 1800s among the later poems indicates deliberate design.<note
                            place="foot" resp="editors"> Tighe provides dates for six poems composed after 1805: "Song Adapted to an Air by Mozart 1806," "Song 1806" ("Turn on
                            me, Love, thine eye of blue"), "To W. Hayley. In return for a copy of Cowper's life sent with a sonnet. 1806," "The Myrtle Written at West Aston.
                            1808," "Sonnet to W. Parnell written at Avondale 1808," and "Sonnet In reply to Mrs Wilmot. 1807." It is possible that some of the undated poems
                            might have been composed after 1805.</note> In <title level="m">Verses</title> Tighe establishes the contours and contents of a definitive
                        collection of her poems.</p>

                <div type="section">
                    <head>Tighe's Determination Not to Publish</head>
                    <p> The extraordinary quality of the material in <title level="m">Verses</title> makes it particularly unfortunate that Tighe rejected the prospect of
                        editing her own <title level="m">Psyche, with Other Poems</title> in 1805 or sharing <title level="m">Verses Transcribed for H.T.</title> (or her novel
                            <title level="m">Selena</title>) with the reading public. But as a relatively privileged member of the Anglo-Irish gentry, Tighe experienced no
                        economic need to publish and some social constraint not to publish. Born in Dublin on October 9, 1772, she was the second child of Marsh librarian Rev.
                        William Blachford (1730-1773) and Methodist leader Theodosia Tighe Blachford (1744-1817), 20 months younger than her brother John (1771-1817). Her
                        father died seven months after her birth, leaving her mother a wealthy widow who focused on educating her children and engaging in charitable
                        activities. Many members of Tighe's family published, including her mother, who translated <title level="m">The Life of the Baroness de Chantal</title>
                        (1787), her uncle Richard Tighe, who wrote a life of William Law, her uncle Edward Tighe, the theater critic "Melantius," and her cousin William Tighe,
                        author of <title level="m">Statistical Observations Relative to the County of Kilkenny</title> (1802) and <title level="m">The Plants</title> (1808).
                        But as many or more members of the family and well-placed friends engaged in a thriving coterie culture of shared manuscripts, albums, and commonplace
                        books, often centered at Rossana, the Wicklow county home of Tighe's aunt and mother-in-law Sarah Fownes Tighe. Tighe grew up in a generously
                        intellectual familial environment that offered multiple models for expression and immediate access to appreciative readers in Ireland, England, and
                        Wales. After she and Henry Tighe consummated their troubled courtship with an equally troubled marriage in 1793, they spent most of the 1790s in London
                        and its environs, a move that expanded Tighe's literary and social network and caused her some spiritual agony as she rued and reveled in the pleasure
                        she took in being admired (she was renowned for her great beauty).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> One of Tighe's surviving journal entries dated
                            March 25, 1796 (or 1797) confesses that she is "Very unhappy in my mind—Yet I find it impossible to resist the flattering temptation of being
                            admired, &amp; showing the world that I am so. My conscience this day has been disturbed—I feel uneasy at the vanity, the folly, the dissipation

                            221).</note> When the Tighes resettled in Ireland in 1801, Tighe focused intensively on her writing, completing <title level="m">Psyche</title> in
                        1802 and <title level="m">Selena</title> in 1803.</p>
                    <p> In January 1804 Tighe exhibited symptoms of the consumption that took her to England that August, where her ongoing commitment to her work prompted
                        family and friends to suggest publication. She took the suggestion seriously but declined. Surprisingly, in light of the plenitude of verses in <title
                            level="m">Verses</title>, one of the reasons Tighe opted not to publish her own version of <title level="m">Psyche, with Other Poems</title> in
                        1805 centered on her fear that the lyric poems would serve as mere ballast to <title level="m">Psyche</title>, or "the straw appendages of a kite," as
                        she put it in a Christmas Eve 1804 letter to her friend and sometime mentor Joseph Cooper Walker, the Irish antiquarian: 
                    <quote>I have myself been on the very verge of a most frightful auspice &amp; had almost been persuaded to expose to the mercy of the reviewers, Edinburg
                        butchers &amp; all, my poor little Psyche &amp; a volume of smaller poems which I was advis'd to add, as I might, to serve like the straw appendages of
                        a kite, that she might not fall to the ground by her own weight — however after a few nights agitation I found that I have not nerves for it, let my
                        stock of self conceit be as great as it may. (TCD MS 1461/7/194, <title level="m">Collected Poems and Journals</title> xxxiii)</quote>
                    Tighe's important invocation of the "butchers" at the <title level="m">Edinburgh Review</title> provides a crucial context for her fears. No matter how
                        much she enjoyed the approbation of her coterie readers, she was not prepared to risk her reputation as a "proper lady" and be reassigned to Richard
                        Polwhele's band of "unsex'd females" by exposing the sensuality of <title level="m">Psyche</title> and the eroticism of her lyrics to reviewers who
                        might see her stepping beyond the bounds of female decorum.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Richard Polwhele dedicated his polemical poem <title
                                level="m">The Unsex'd Females</title> (1798) to T. J. Mathias, who used that phrase in his conservative satire <title level="m">The Pursuits of
                                Literature</title> (1794). Although Mathias recommended that Tighe publish <title level="m">Psyche</title>, she cited prudence in a letter to
                            him dated August 2, 1806: "I am not insensible to the value of praise from such a pen, so that if the resolutions now made by prudence &amp;
                            timidity shall ever be conquer'd, he will have to reproach himself, in a grand degree, for the ill-success of a publication he has so powerfully
                            encourag'd" (BL 22976: 248-9). For the validity of Tighe's fears see Andrea Bradley's insightful discussion of the <title level="m">Edinburgh

                        that even her coterie readers might condemn her depiction of love:
                    <quote>The author, who dismisses to the public the darling object of his solitary cares, must be prepared to consider, with some degree of indifference, the

                        they may perhaps think too long, they will yet do me the justice to allow, that I have only pictured innocent love, such love as the purest bosom might

                     <p>Despite the concerns Tighe expressed in the 1802 preface—and the 1804 Christmas Eve letter to Walker—she did continue to think about commercial
                        publication throughout the spring of 1805, while she was preparing the private edition of <title level="m">Psyche</title>. On April 19, 1805 she
                        described her frustration with the taxing process of print production in another letter to Walker that wonders how much worse it would be if she were
                        "publishing":
                    <quote>Longman has not advertised the work about which I feel much interested — I suppose it has been retarded by the disputes of the printers; poor Psyche
                        continued her literary journey under very unfavourable auspices; in the course of two months I have had just four sheets! — I find correcting the
                        proofs very sickening &amp; quite endless, for as often as I get a revise as I still see something to alter, I will not say I amend it, but it goes
                        back cover'd with scratches — Mr. Carpenter threatens me with ruin, but I cannot help it. What should I do were I publishing? (TCD MS 1461/6/74)</quote>

                    <p>
                     Printing the private edition would not have precluded publishing a commercial volume that paired <title level="m">Psyche</title> with selections from
                            <title level="m">Verses</title>, the initial impetus spurring its more pleasurable, handcrafted production. But the very act of transcribing poems
                        for <title level="m">Verses</title> must have made Tighe realize how difficult it would be to select enough appropriate smaller poems and maintain her
                        status as a proper lady. Readers might easily misconstrue imagination for experience, a dilemma she dramatizes in <title level="m">Selena</title>, when
                        the characters Selena Miltern and Lady Emily Trevallyn discuss the implications of Angela Harley's passionate poem "The Picture" (transcribed in <title

                    Selena takes the poem as direct evidence of Angela's fall from grace: "'if poor Angela did indeed write those verses, I fear she is lost not only to
                        happiness and her poor Mother, but even to innocence. What virtuous girl could bear thus openly to boast a passion for which it is evident she even
                        then doubted of meeting a faithful return?'" (324). Lady Trevallyn assures Selena that Angela very certainly wrote the poem—because Angela, like
                        Tighe, filled the pages with her own scratches—but disagrees with Selena's conclusion, citing the power of imagination to enhance feeling during the
                        act of poetic composition: "'I know when the fit of writing seizes a person who is in the habit of this dangerous indulgence, one is inclined to
                        express in even stronger language than the heart at other times feels the sentiments we scarce allow ourselves in plain prose to speak'" (325).
                        Although Lady Trevallyn probably voices Tighe's aesthetic position, Tighe scripts Lady Trevallyn as a victim of excessive sensibility whose reputation
                        suffers when she misreads a set of social cues that the morally sensitive Selena more accurately assesses.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In <title
                                level="m">Selena</title> Tighe weaves a complicated courtship plot around three inter-connected young women and the men who love and/or leave
                            them. In the main plot the title character Selena Miltern is coerced into marrying her cousin Lord Dallamore and subsequently falls in love with
                            Dallamore’s cousin Sidney Dallamore. In an important corollary plot Selena’s friend Lady Emily Trevallyn continues to long for her cousin Lord
                            Henry Ortney after she marries the significantly older Lord Trevallyn to fulfill her mother’s deathbed request. And in an equally important subplot
                            Lord Henry seduces Angela Harley, who was raised by Lady Trevallyn’s (and Lord Henry’s) aunt Lady Anne Ortney. Four of the characters write poetry,
                            including Lady Emily, Angela, Sidney Dallamore, and Edwin Stanmore, one of Selena’s suitors.</note></p>
                    <p> Any doubts as to the predictive accuracy of assessments like Selena's would have been laid to rest when Tighe witnessed the infamous reception of

                        recognized that publishing her lyric exchanges with Moore in her <title level="m">Verses</title> could subject her to an equally painful and perhaps
                        even more disciplinary critique, especially since he had already published his poems to her in his <title level="m">Epistles</title> (as well as his
                        1801 <title level="m">The Poetical Works of the Late Thomas Little, Esq</title>.). The <title level="m">Literary Journal</title> sternly reproved the
                        "ladies of fashion" who allowed Moore to use their names in his poems, equating them with courtesans in a brothel:
                    <quote>What surprised us most was to see the names of several ladies of fashion, who, it would appear, favour the author with much intimacy, inscribed at the
                        head of some of the poems. He does not indeed talk b-----y in the pieces which he immediately addresses to these ladies; but such is the tenor of the
                        surrounding poems that we should think it equally delicate in these ladies to permit their portraits to be suspended in a public bagnio, with this
                        inscription: "Hung up here by her ladyship's permission." (648)</quote>
                    Better and worse, the <title level="m">Critical Review</title> specifically attacked Moore for having the audacity to publish a poem praising Tighe's

                            Llangollen in 1804 (NLW MS 22985B).</note>—and positioned Tighe as the moral antithesis to Moore in the concluding paragraph of the review:
                    <quote> How could such a writer, if thoroughly known, have presumed to offer a compliment to Mrs. Henry T—ghe, the authoress of Psyche? That poem, intended to
                        give pleasure only to a private circle of friends, and concealed from the public eye by the timid modesty of a lady who blushes even at her own
                        perfections, spreads its wings too wide for the nest, and will soon, it is hoped, be permitted to escape from privacy and confinement to that general
                        admiration which awaits it. The incense offered by Mr. Moore could not have had a pleasant savour to a poetess, who, in treating the subject of love,
                        becomes the championess of delicacy and purity; and who inculcates sentiments so chaste, tender, and moral, that no better antidote to the poison of
                        these poems could be devised, than the precepts and the poetry of "Psyche." (123)</quote>
                    What might the <title level="m">Critical Review</title> say about Tighe's "delicacy and purity" if they saw the <title level="m">Verses</title> poems
                        she shared with Moore? What might the <title level="m">Edinburgh Review</title> say, which had warned about the pernicious influence of Moore's <title

                    <quote>It is upon the other sex, that we conceive its effects may be most pernicious; and it is chiefly as an insult upon their delicacy, and an attack upon
                        their purity, that we are disposed to resent its publication . . . . women are now beginning to receive a more extended education, to venture more
                        freely and largely into the fields of literature, and to become more of intellectual and independent creatures, than they have yet been in these
                        islands. In these circumstances, it seems to be of incalculable importance, that no attaint should be given to the delicacy of purity of their
                        expanding minds; that their increasing knowledge should be of good chiefly, and not of evil; that they should not consider modesty as one of the
                        prejudices from which they are now to be emancipated; nor found any part of their new influence upon the licentiousness of which Mr Moore invites them
                        to be partakers. (458-59)<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Interestingly, the next article in the <title level="m">Edinburgh Review</title> offers a
                            mostly favorable review of Opie's <title level="m">Simple Tales</title> for expressing appropriately gendered merits that reproduce the natural
                            pathos of her <title level="m">Mother and Daughters</title>: "There is something delightfully feminine in all Mrs. Opie's writings . . . . very
                            amiable and very beautiful; and exhibit virtuous emotions under a very graceful aspect. They would do very well to form a woman that a gentleman
                            should fall in love with" (467, 471). A poet like Tighe would be caught between the Scylla and Charybdis of Moore and Opie. While Tighe resists
                            commenting on the specifics of the <title level="m">ER</title>'s review of Moore, she does comment on the Opie review in her reading journal: "Mrs
                            Opie's simple tales they praise fully as much as they deserve &amp; they give as a specimen a letter I thought very poor &amp; some of the poetry
                            which I did not think very good - yet they are pathetic &amp; tender" (NLI MS 4804).</note></quote>
                    Tighe never gave the reviewers the chance to say anything at all. She reluctantly considered going forward with a commercial edition of <title level="m"
                            >Psyche; or the Legend of Love</title> in February 1806 when she heard that an unlicensed edition had been advertised in London, but directed
                        Carpenter to threaten prosecution and thus successfully averted unintentional publication:
                    <quote>I have been told that Psyche is advertis'd in London, &amp; tho I do not believe it, yet I write at Mr Tighe's desire to request, that should this be
                        the case either now or in the future, that you will <title level="m">immediately</title> take whatever steps can be taken towards preventing the
                        publication if possible &amp; if not for commencing a prosecution — If it is to be publish'd I would certainly do all in my power that you might be
                        before hand with an edition of our own, &amp; as you have express'd yourself in so obliging a manner on the subject I hope for both our sakes that you

                            Poems</title> in May 1811.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Although Rev. J. Whitelaw and Rev. Robert Walsh began the trend of naming William
                            Tighe as the unidentified editor in their <title level="m">History of Dublin</title> (2:1214-15), Averill Buchanan offers compelling evidence that
                            Henry Tighe edited the collection with the assistance of Tighe's brother John Blachford (120).</note> They prominently demarcated it as a
                        posthumous edition "by the late Mrs. Henry Tighe" with a note to the reader that justified the publication of her poems as not just a monument to her
                        good taste (and her physical suffering) but to her capacity to "improve the best sensations of the human heart," presumably the guiding principle that
                        governed their selection of the "smaller poems":
                    <quote><p rend="noCount"> To possess strong feelings and amiable affections, and to express them with a nice discrimination, has been the attribute of many female writers; some
                        of whom have also participated with the author of Psyche in the unhappy lot of a suffering frame and a premature death. Had the publication of her
                        poems served only as the fleeting record of such a destiny, and as a monument of private regret, her friends would not have thought themselves
                        justified in displaying them to the world. But when a writer intimately acquainted with classical literature, and guided by a taste for real
                        excellence, has delivered in polished language such sentiments as can tend only to encourage and improve the best sensations of the human heart, then
                        it becomes a sort of duty in surviving friends no longer to withhold from the public such precious relics.</p>
                        <p rend="noCount"> The copies of Psyche printed for the author in her lifetime were borrowed with avidity, and read with delight; and the partiality of friends has been
                        already outstripped by the applause of admirers.</p>
                        <p rend="noCount"> The smaller poems which complete this volume may perhaps stand in need of that indulgence which a posthumous work always demands when it did not
                        receive the correction of the author. They have been selected from a larger number of poems, which were the occasional effusion of her thoughts, or
                        productions of her leisure, but not originally intended or pointed out by herself for publication. (iii-v)</p></quote>
                    Although the editor begs indulgence for the smaller poems because they lacked Tighe's final corrections, the resulting implication that the 29 lyrics
                        from <title level="m">Verses</title> were less polished than <title level="m">Psyche</title> is misleading on two counts. First, the 1811 <title
                            level="m">Psyche</title> published in the Longman edition offers a lightly revised version of the 1805 <title level="m">Psyche</title> printed by
                        Carpenter, without explaining whether Tighe herself corrected the 1805 version or, more likely, the 1811 editor. Second, the 29 lyrics from <title
                            level="m">Verses</title> were highly finished and painstakingly transcribed by Tighe for H.T. in direct relation to publication (initially as
                        prelude and subsequently as alternative to publication).</p>
                    <p> Unfortunately Tighe's worry that the "smaller poems" might serve as simple ballast or a tail for <title level="m">Psyche</title> was borne out by the
                        reviews the posthumous edition received, which offered a great deal of praise for <title level="m">Psyche</title> but paid minimal if any attention to
                        the lyrics, often dismissing them after citing the editor's apologia (<title level="m">Monthly Review</title> 149) or seeing them as a light "wreath"
                        at the end of the volume, "lovely indeed, but scarcely worth the brow of Psyche" (<title level="m">Eclectic Review</title> 228).<note place="foot"
                            resp="editors"> For more discussion of the reviews see Linkin's "More than <title level="m">Psyche</title>."</note> Thus Tighe's reputation rested
                        primarily on <title level="m">Psyche</title> during most of the nineteenth and twentieth century, without much attention to or awareness of her lyrics.
                        One can only wonder what might have happened had Tighe gone forward with her project and prepared her own version of <title level="m">Psyche, with
                            Other Poems</title>, and which of the poems from <title level="m">Verses</title> she would have selected for inclusion.</p>
                    <p> As a highly wrought material object it is curious that the two substantial volumes of <title level="m">Verses</title> remained largely invisible for
                        more than 200 years (akin to the comparable history of Tighe's five-volume manuscript novel <title level="m">Selena</title>, although <title level="m"
                            >Selena</title> only disappeared for a century or so). Neither Tighe's mother Theodosia Blachford nor her cousin and sister-in-law Caroline
                        Hamilton mention <title level="m">Verses</title> in their biographical essays on Tighe, the primary sources for contemporary information about Tighe's
                        life and literary production, although Hamilton may be pointing to it in her comment on the tailpieces Tighe designed for her manuscripts: "the only
                        use she made of her skill in drawing was to ornament with appropriate tail pieces, her occasional little Poems of which she has left many neatly
                        written manuscripts" (252).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Caroline Hamilton was a skilled artist who received private lessons from Jonathan
                            Spilsbury (as did her sisters) while her brother Henry Tighe studied at Harrow (1781-1788). After the Tighes returned to Ireland Sarah Tighe
                            engaged the Spilsburys to continue instructing her children in drawing and music and to engage in evangelical work (1789-1790). It is likely that
                            Mary Tighe took occasional lessons from the Spilsburys. See Charlotte Yeldham 21-26.</note> It is also possible that Hamilton used <title level="m"
                            >Verses</title> as the source text for the many Tighe poems she copied into her numerous albums (however Hamilton's versions often vary from the
                        versions in <title level="m">Verses</title> and might have been transcribed from memory).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The National Library of
                            Ireland has dozens of Caroline Hamilton's commonplace books.</note> It's clear that eight of the 13 poems family friends Henry and Lucy Moore
                        transcribed in their 1809 and 1811 albums come from <title level="m">Verses</title>; almost all the poems transcribed in the 1811 album contain an
                        endnote that states "copied from M<hi rendition="#sup">rs</hi> Tighe's M.S. Innistiogue - May - 1811."<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The

                        <title level="m">Verses</title> also provides the most likely source for the 12 unpublished poems E. I. Fox transcribed in "Poems by Mrs. H. Tighe.

                    <p> Most intriguingly, and ironically, <title level="m">Verses</title> might well be one of the Tighe memorials Felicia Hemans lamented reading in her 1834
                        sonnet "On Records of Immature Genius: Written after reading <title level="m">Memorials of the late Mrs. Tighe</title>" because the memorials
                        transformed Hemans's sense of Tighe as a proper lady and role model:

                    Hemans first wrote about Tighe as the unnamed woman poet in her 1827 "The Grave of a Poetess" (subsequently published as the concluding poem of her 1828
                        sequence <title level="m">Records of Woman</title>), imagining herself looking at Tighe's gravesite with admiration and envy because she envisioned
                        Tighe as a spiritual exemplar who transcended the vicissitudes of life and art through death. Her impression of Tighe dramatically changed after she
                        moved to Dublin in 1831 and actually visited Tighe's grave (commemorated in her 1831 lyric "Written after Visiting a Tomb, Near Woodstock, in the
                        County of Kilkenny"). During the visit to Woodstock she not only met Henry Tighe, who failed to impress her by presenting her with his Latin
                        translation of her "The Graves of a Household," but she learned details about Tighe's life that caused her to "give up my beau ideal of Mrs. Tighe's
                        Character . . . much of her domestic sorrow I learned, was caused by her excessive passion for shining in Society, which quite carried her away from
                        Home-enjoyments, until her Health gave way, and she was compelled to relinquish this career of dissipation" (Letter to Clara Graves, July 1831).<note
                            place="foot" resp="editors"> Later Hemans comments "Mr. Tighe, the widower of the Poetess, was amongst our party; he had just been translating a
                            poem of mine into Latin, which I am told is very elegant. He is very intelligent &amp; gentlemanly, nevertheless, '<title level="m">I did not like
                                this Dr. Fell</title>'" (Wolfson 515).</note>
                    </p>
                    <p> Although Hemans' several letters about this visit do not mention <title level="m">Verses</title>, Henry Chorley's 1834 <title level="m">Memorials of
                            Mrs. Hemans</title> notes that Hemans wrote "Records of Immature Genius" after "reading some of [Tighe's] earlier poems in manuscript"
                            (2:219).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Hemans's sister Harriet Hughes similarly notes "The sonnet 'On Records of Immature Genius' (published in
                            Mrs Hemans's <title level="m">Poetical Remains</title>), was written after reading some of the earlier poems of Mrs Tighe, which had been lent to
                            her in MS" (1.239).</note> If Chorley means <title level="m">Verses</title>, it is inaccurate (at best) for Hemans to consider the lyrics Tighe
                        collected in 1805—when she was nearly 33—as records of immature genius except insofar as they shatter the image that she was finally "from
                        passion-gusts made free!" (14).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Hemans transcribes a copy of the poem under the title "On the relics of immature
                            genius: written after reading some unpublished pieces by Mrs. Tighe" in Hamilton's Hamwood Album (22984C/49).</note> That image and story—of a
                        Tighe who turns from seducing passions to sober spirituality—is constructed by the posthumous edition of <title level="m">Psyche, with Other
                            Poems</title>, and perhaps not untrue biographically, but very different from the impression conveyed by the often unsettling and unsettled poems
                        in <title level="m">Verses</title>. </p>
                    <p> The Mary Tighe who shapes her poetic performance in <title level="m">Verses</title> is neither ready to be buried as the unnamed pattern poetess in
                        Hemans' "The Grave of a Poetess" nor beatified as the late Mrs. Henry Tighe in <title level="m">Psyche, with Other Poems</title>, which concludes with
                        the plaintive final request of "On Receiving a Branch of Mezereon Which Flowered at Woodstock. December, 1809" to be remembered "with fond regret" and
                        "lingering thoughts" (311). The Mary Tighe of <title level="m">Verses</title> is a passionate, playful, ambitious poet whose most powerful poems
                        pulsate with the frustrated energies of unfulfilled Petrarchan desire voiced from a complex feminine position.</p>

                    <p> Tighe positions herself first and last as a practicing poet in <title level="m">Verses</title>. In the opening lyric, "The Vartree," she dedicates
                        herself to the pastoral pursuit of poetry versus the "vain bustle of the senseless crowd" (29), emphasizing her identity as a poet by referring to
                        herself via her coterie name "Linda,"<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In addition to "The Vartree" Tighe identifies herself as "Linda" in "The Hours
                            of Peace," "Verses Written when a detachment of Yeomen were sent against the rebel army," and "Song to my Harp 1798." Sarah Ponsonby names her
                            "Linda" in a manuscript poem praising <title level="m">Psyche</title> ("Sweet Linda! Meditate thy charming song"), as does E. I. Fox in a tribute
                            at the end of "Poems by Mrs. H. Tighe," noting that Linda was "Her own poetic appellation" (no page).</note> and affiliating herself with a

                    <p> The poems that follow "The Vartree" and precede the "Sonnet in reply to Mrs. Wilmot" further Tighe's projection of herself as a coterie poet. She
                        follows the dedicatory pastoralism of "The Vartree" with the Della Cruscan sensuality of "The Kiss," one of several "kiss" poems she and Moore wrote in

                    Right after the demonstrative poetics of "The Kiss," "The Hours of Peace" reasserts the theme of "The Vartree" as Tighe/Linda celebrates a literary life
                        that consists of producing work like "The Kiss," to be shared during pleasurable social evenings at home, listening to Moore/Anacreon sing his songs
                        instead of pursuing the temptations of idle society:

                    Similarly, the poem that precedes the final sonnet to Lady Dacre, "Sonnet to W. Parnell written at Avondale 1808," commemorates another coterie member,
                        William Parnell,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> William Parnell (1780-1821), later Parnell-Hayes, was a family friend and MP for Wicklow perhaps

                        prevents him from experiencing "the Muse's gentler influence," which Tighe makes manifest in the sonnet itself:

                    Tighe not only situates herself again as a poet, who displays the favor of the Muse's influence, her invocation of Parnell in this penultimate poem
                        subtly calls attention to her status as a known literary figure in Ireland. When Parnell published an Irish edition of William Smyth's <title level="m"
                            >English Lyricks</title> (Dublin, 1806) in a larger effort to restore the business of printing to Ireland after the destructive impact of the Act
                        of Union, he dedicated the edition to "Mrs. Henry Tighe": 
                    <quote>Amongst many injuries of greater magnitude which the Union has inflicted on the civilization of Ireland, the destruction of the business of Printing has
                        had an effect sufficiently pernicious to excite an interest in any mind capable of appreciating the value of local literature. . . . The propriety of
                        inscribing these Poems to you, must be generally felt: my particular design in so doing, is to express the admiration of gratified taste, and the
                        homage of sincere friendship.</quote>
                    Thus the poems that initiate and conclude <title level="m">Verses Transcribed for H.T.</title> insistently frame Tighe's representation of herself as a
                        poet who undertakes her lyric journey with an act of dedication to the muses and ends with a bittersweet affirmation of the journey's success. </p>
                    <p> The journey Tighe transcribes in <title level="m">Verses</title> follows a thematic versus chronological or strictly genre-based structure, organized
                        in sets or clusters of poetic modes. If there is a story the two volumes tell, the story begins with a group of coterie poems that map physical and
                        emotional landscapes Tighe visited during the mid- to late-1790s and early 1800s (the first 17 poems), modulates into a set of poems ostensibly voiced
                        by the characters from <title level="m">Selena</title> (most of the next nine poems), introduces a mini-cluster of four translations, and offers a
                        transitional poem that returns to the present and Tighe's personal lyric voice ("Verses Written in Sickness Dec.<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> 1804")
                        before showcasing the 30-poem sonnet cycle that completes the first volume (61 poems in all). The second volume opens with 10 poems focused on history
                        and politics followed by a set of 29 translations; the remaining 21 poems fall into mini-clusters of political poems, thank you poems, translations,
                        and sonnets (60 poems in all). Neither volume adheres rigidly to a particular pattern—Tighe doesn't place all the sonnets in the sonnet cycle, or all
                        the translations in the translation section, or all the <title level="m">Selena</title> poems in a <title level="m">Selena</title> cluster—but there
                        is a clear design ordering her presentation. The slight messiness of the trajectory towards the end of volume two might indicate that Tighe lost some
                        steam towards the culmination of this major project, which she began in 1805 but continued to work on through 1808 (as her health declined). But her
                        inclusions and omissions at the end of the second volume maintain the intentionality of the volumes' comprehensive construction. She not only
                        juxtaposes early and late poems in the final sequence of nine poems (dated 1804, 1806, 1801, 1808, undated, undated, 1799, 1808, 1807), she omits six
                        late lyrics that her coterie readers appreciated enough to copy into their own commonplace books. She could have added these poems, given the blank
                        pages at the end of both volumes of <title level="m">Verses</title>, to transform our sense of the ending.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> She did

                        example is her previously unpublished ekphrastic lyric on "The Faded Flowers," which offers a thoughtful meditation on the relation between nature and
                        art that shifts from querying the potential of the imitative arts to capture nature to pondering the role of memory in containing or recreating past
                        desire, Tighe's great theme. In the first five stanzas the poem describes the speaker's efforts to sketch a group of flowers before they die; in the
                        pivotal sixth stanza the poem allusively cites Shakespeare's inconstant lover Proteus before offering another five stanzas that reflect on the cheating
                        power of memory to create the temporary illusion of restoration:

                    As with so many lyrics in Tighe's oeuvre, "The Faded Flowers" speaks with characteristic ambivalence on the power of memory and art to recover or
                        control desire, like Sonnet VIII ("As one who late hath lost a friend ador'd"), where the "shivering heart" seeks to re-experience "bliss once tasted"
                        through portraits and poems that revive memories which initially beguile but then enhance present loss of those "scenes from which it wept to part"
                        (11-14).

                    So too "Address to my Harp," where the "sickening heart" hopes to simulate the function of an absent harp to relieve "secret pain" (23) yet induce
                        "pensive, pleasing pain" (15) through memories that ultimately return that pain: "Yet still thy strings, in Fancy's ear, / With soothing melody shall
                        play, / Thy silver sounds I oft shall hear, / To pensive gloom a silent prey" (37-40).

                    The tailpieces that follow all three poems nicely complement the verbal paradoxes with an additional visual ambiguity by depicting vibrant images of
                        static objects and scenes: the scentless flowers of "The Faded Flowers" (figure 1), the unwalkable landscape of "Sonnet VIII" (figure 2), and the
                        silent harp of "Address to my Harp" (figure 3). Thus "The Faded Flowers," like "Sonnet VIII" or "Address to my Harp," manifests success and failure at
                        once: as poet and artist Tighe powerfully immortalizes the image of the flowers before they droop, but her perfect representation of their "lustre"
                        still "mocks" her "hope" in that her "imitative care" can never reproduce or replace experience itself, can only memorialize and thereby heighten
                        loss.</p>

                        <title level="m">Verses</title> also provides manuscript access to poems that demonstrate Tighe's engagement with the poetic, aesthetic, and political
                        concerns of her cultural moment, unlike the lyrics selected for <title level="m">Psyche, with Other Poems</title>, which largely refer to local places
                        or personal acquaintances.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The <title level="m">Psyche</title> poems name Rossana, Woodstock, Avondale, Killarney,
                            Scarborough, and Malvern (places Tighe inhabited or visited in Ireland or England) and family and friends (her brother John Blachford, her aunt
                            Margaret Tighe, her cousin William Tighe, her niece Sarah Kelly, and her friends Lady Asgill, Lady Charlemont, and William Parnell). The few
                            exceptions include the patriotic sonnet on Charles James Fox, the ballad on the atrocities of 1798 ("Bryan Byrne, of Glenmalure"), the Metastasio
                            imitation "To Fortune," epigraphs from Statius ("Morning") and Poliziano/Molza ("The Vartree"), and incidental references to Senegal ("Pleasure")
                            and Persia ("The Shawl's Petition, To Lady Asgill"). One could also include Tighe's invocations of the Bible in "A Faithful Friend is the Medicine
                            of Life," "Imitated from Jeremiah" and "Hagar in the Desert."</note> In <title level="m">Verses</title> Tighe leaves a direct and indirect trail of
                        references to a wide range of contemporary or near-contemporary poets through title dedications, epigraphs, translations, and invocations that cite
                        Thomas Gray, Francis Greville, Thomas Warton, Salomon Gessner, William Cowper, James Beattie, James Macpherson, Hannah More, Anna Seward, Charlotte
                        Smith, Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian, Évariste de Parny, Vincenzo Monti, Mary Robinson, Charles Demoustier, William Bowles, Lady Dacre, Samuel Taylor
                        Coleridge, and Thomas Moore (as well as Metastasio). Sometimes those invocations operate with great subtlety, as in the August 15, 1804 sonnet
                        "Addressed to the Rev.<hi rendition="#sup">d</hi> W: L: Bowles" (XV), which concludes with the classic image of "the sad nightingale soft [who] pours
                        her throat / While the thorn presses on her wounded breast" (13-14). That image does not appear in Bowles's 1789 <title level="m">Fourteen

                        with great frequency in Smith's <title level="m">Elegiac Sonnets</title> (1784-1811), which Tighe was thinking about in 1804. A letter to Walker dated
                        January 28, 1804 mentions "Charlotte Smith's distresses" (1461/5/156). Sometimes those invocations suggest an ongoing conversation, such as "Verses
                        Imitated from Du Moustier," which presents a fairly loose verse translation of Demoustier's lyric "Je vais boire l'onde glacée," his version of
                        Sappho's stanzas to Phaon before she takes the leap of Leucata (in <title level="m">Lettres à Émilie, sur la mythologie</title> [1786-98]), but also
                        speaks to Robinson's more significant and more radical sonnet cycle <title level="m">Sappho and Phaon</title> (1796). Similarly Tighe's sonnet
                        "Addressed to the Ladies of Langollen Vale" (XIV) not only addresses Butler and Ponsonby but participates in a dialogue with Seward's "Llangollen Vale"
                        (1796), which prompted Seward to offer rare praise for Tighe's sonnet (rare for Seward, that is).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In a letter to Rev.
                            Henry White dated April 7, 1795 Seward mentions meeting Tighe while visiting Butler and Ponsonby and notes that "She left an elegant and accurate
                            sonnet, addressed to Lady E. Butler and her friend, on leaving their enchanting bowers" (4:108). Tighe postdates her sonnet 1796 in <title

                        John Horne Tooke in the 1794 Treason Trials but speaks to Coleridge's complementary sonnet "To Erskine," published in the <title level="m">Morning
                            Chronicle</title> on December 1, 1794 (when the Tighes were living in England).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In 1794 the British government
                            sought to cripple the radical and reform movement of the 1790s by rounding up suspected revolutionaries and charging them with treason. More than
                            30 radicals were arrested; habeas corpus was suspended in May. The Treason Trials began in October and concluded in December. Thomas Hardy, John
                            Horne Tooke, and John Thelwall were tried separately. Each one was exonerated with great public rejoicing, which forced crown lawyers to drop
                            charges against the remaining prisoners.</note></p>
                    <p> The sonnets to Bowles/Smith and the Ladies of Llangollen/Seward reflect Tighe's contemporary aesthetic commitment to the sonnet revival,<note
                            place="foot" resp="editors"> During much of the eighteenth century use of the sonnet form declined and was even scorned by Pope, Dryden and
                            Johnson. In the 1770s and 1780s the sonnet began to regain popularity through the work of Thomas Gray, Charlotte Smith, Anna Seward, and William
                            Lisle Bowles. </note> a demonstration made more potent through Tighe's clustering those two sonnets with two Petrarch imitations at the very heart
                        of her sonnet cycle (XII-XV). Tighe's central engagement with the discourse of sensibility is also made more explicit in <title level="m"
                            >Verses</title> through poems like "The Kiss," with its display of Della Cruscan eroticism, "Verses Written for Emily 1799," which begs
                        "Insensibility" to "Stop the streams which feeling hallows / Smother each impassioned sigh" (39-40), "Song to Oberon," which models itself on
                        Greville's "A Prayer for Indifference," "To Tranquility," which asks "Ador'd Tranquillity! / This fever'd heart to health restore, / Or lull to Apathy"
                        (30-32), or "Sensibility," which follows More's poetical epistle "Sensibility" (not to mention the poems that cite Gray, Warton, Macpherson, or Beattie
                        and other such exemplars). In tandem with poems that evince the discourse of sensibility are poems that exhibit Tighe's antiquarian bent ("Cleuen An
                        Elegy" or "Morven and Miruna from Ossian") and her interest in ballads and songs, captured in at least 14 lyrics, such as "Song Post nublia Phoebus,"
                        "Forget me not!" (based on Mozart's version of Lorenz Schneider's lied "Vergiss Mein Nicht"), "Song to Oberon," or "Song to my Harp 1798."<note

                    <p> Perhaps most interesting are the poems that overtly or covertly address contemporary political events—the 1794 Treason Trials, the 1798 Rebellion, the
                        1801 Act of Union—which Tighe sets in two clusters in volume two, effectively encouraging more politicized readings of poems that might otherwise seem
                        ahistorical but for their clustered proximity. Tighe positions the first cluster at the very beginning of volume two with six poems that invite close
                        attention to Ireland's historical moment through suggestive dates and references: "Cleuen An Elegy," "Written in an Almanack 1805," "The World,"
                        "Imitation from Jeremiah Chap XXXI. Ver 15. Nov:<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> 1800," "Psalm CXXX. Imitated. Jan.<hi rendition="#sup">y</hi> 1805,"
                        and "Verses Written when a detachment of Yeomen were sent against the rebel army" (dated Dublin, July 13, 1798). In the first poem, "Cleuen An Elegy,"
                        Tighe's speaker narrates the fatal consequences of a doomed love triangle, but frames that narration against the backdrop of England's colonization of
                        Ireland, made visible in the ruins that line the Nore river:

                    Given Tighe's family position as a member of the Anglo-Irish gentry, she sometimes sides with the oppressor. While the politics of Cleuen critique
                        England's imperialism, the narrative offers a mostly sympathetic portrait of the heartbroken young Englishman Aldred who joins a "daring and
                        adventurous crew, / With them from Albion's friendly coast was born, / And plough'd the waves Hibernia to subdue" (130-32). The closing poem in the
                        sequence, "Verses Written when a detachment of Yeomen were sent against the rebel army," prays for the success of Wicklow yeomen like her husband
                        against the "savage" rebels<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The Wicklow Yeomen were part-time soldiers (mostly gentry) loyal to the British

                            military action in Dublin was deterred, fighting in the county of Wicklow was fierce.</note> (Henry Tighe led a troop of cavalry through the

                    <p>
                    Tighe positions four poems between "Cleuen" and "Yeoman": "Written in an Almanack 1805," "The World," "Imitation from Jeremiah Chap XXXI. Ver 15.
                            Nov:<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> 1800," and "Psalm CXXX. Imitated. Jan.<hi rendition="#sup">y</hi> 1805." All four lend themselves to
                        politicized readings by being placed between these two overtly political poems. "Written in an Almanack 1805" seems particularly apolitical as a simple
                        12-line poem that appears to be a copy of an inscription Tighe wrote in a gift book. But the most popular almanac in Dublin, <title level="m">The
                            Gentleman's and Citizen's Alamack</title>, provided an annual listing of "The Marriages and Deaths of the Princes of Europe. The Names of the Lord
                        Lieutenant; of His Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council, and of the Lords and Commons of Parliament, (Printed by Authority:) Also, the Judges, and
                        several other Persons in Places of High Trust, and Office in Ireland, both Civil and Military." Coming right after "Cleuen" and that poem's depiction
                        of the colonization of Ireland, "Written in an Almanack 1805" invites attention to the transitory (or transitioning) nature of political power.
                        Similarly, the spiritual rejection of "The ungrateful World!" (2) voiced in "The World" takes a political cast through Tighe's loaded use of the word
                        "votive" — "Oh! sacrifice no more thy peace, thy joys / To the ungrateful World! it but insults / Thy wasted anguish, and thy votive cares" (1-3) — a
                        potential reference to the Tighe family's futile votes against the Act of Union. That subtle reference becomes sharper as Tighe follows "The World"
                        with the pointedly dated "Imitation from Jeremiah Chap XXXI. Ver. 15. Nov:<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> 1800," which implicitly aligns the promised
                        restoration of Rachel's children to their own border with the pending dissolution of the Irish Parliament. Like the imitation of Jeremiah 31:15,
                        Tighe's verse translation of Psalm 130 resonates with the politics of her times as she invokes mercy for all God's children: "And still at mercy's
                        sacred seat / Let all thy children; Lord! be found" (33-34). Without the context of the cluster "Psalm CXXX. Imitated. Jan.<hi rendition="#sup"
                            >y</hi> 1805" reads as a prayer for inward peace; within the context of the cluster the prayer extends that call to the nation.</p>
                    <p> A comparable effect occurs towards the end of volume two as Tighe sequences the powerful political ballad "Bryan Byrne founded on truth" within a
                        cluster that includes "Song 1806," "Bryan Byrne," "Written for Angela," Song to my Harp 1798," and "Song" ("Still as on Liffey's banks I stray"). While
                        "Song 1806," "Written for Angela," and "Song" seem to read as simple love songs—invoking renewal ("Song 1806"), cherishing the moment that is about to
                        pass ("Written for Angela"), and anticipating an uncertain return ("Song")—Tighe juxtaposes those three songs with two songs that speak to the
                        troubles of 1798, as if to weave a larger tale about the intersection of personal history and national strife. "Song 1806" begins the sequence by
                        asking a beloved to turn his blue eyes on her and smile as he did long ago, "Oh! smile, as when / Our youthful loves were in their spring, / And teach
                        this thrilling heart again / The song of joy to sing!" (14-16). But if the next song was inspired by the beloved's smile, it is anything but joyful in
                        relating the tragic tale of Bryan Byrne's violent death at the hands of a loyalist mob in 1798, a murdered nonpartisan still mourned by his grieving
                        widow Ellen, his son and his father-in-law (who also mourn the deaths of Ellen's brother and three cousins). To turn from "Bryan Byrne" to "Written for
                        Angela" is to turn from Ireland's history to a poem intended for Tighe's novel <title level="m">Selena</title>, seemingly nonpolitical except in its
                        rendering of the speaker's desperate valuing of the moment before parting from another blue-eyed beloved. That parting suddenly takes on greater
                        political heft when followed by "Song to my Harp 1798," a second harp poem in <title level="m">Verses</title> that now notes how Tighe's/Linda's harp
                        foregoes pleasure to focus on the dark times at hand with "prophetic power" (24):

                    By the time the sequence concludes with "Song," what might otherwise read as simple anxiety about the faithfulness of a returning beloved becomes
                        fraught with political implications as the speaker thinks about "banishment" on the banks of the Liffey (the location of the Four Courts,<note

                    <p> Akin to the political clusters and the poems that reference contemporary or near-contemporary poets, the stunning visual displays of ruins, prospects,
                        spas, monuments, landscapes, scenery, and assorted tourist sites in the tailpieces situate Tighe more actively in the physical environs of her time and
                        place: at Glendalough in Wicklow, at Muckross Abbey in Killarney, at the Devil's Bridge in Cardiganshire, at the Avon River in Bristol, at Harling Hall
                        in Norfolk, or at Plas Newydd in Llangollen. They also demonstrate her keen engagement with the picturesque and her participation in the burgeoning
                        verbal-visual print culture of views, tours, sketches, and guides.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Tighe's reading journal entries in 1806 and 1807

                        how Tighe illustrated some of her most famous poems, including sonnets of named places such as "III Written at Scarborough Aug<hi rendition="#sup"

                    Like the complex ekphrasis of "The Faded Flowers" Tighe's visual images sometimes complement and sometimes controvert the mental landscapes depicted in
                        the lyrics. Thus while the illustrations for the Killarney sonnets elegantly capture the views and moments celebrated in the lyrics, the sheer
                        corporeality of the images that accompany the Scarborough and Malvern sonnets provide a surprising contrast to the delicate ephemerality of the
                        psychological states the lyrics articulate. Similarly, the tailpiece to the first sonnet in the sonnet sequence, "I. Composed on the White Sands near
                        Arklow" (figure 7), deceptively images the landscape of the remembered past (the caves and cliffs between the Dawlish and Exe rivers) rather than the
                        named landscape prompting the recollection (the caverns and white sands of Arklow).

                        Killarney hints at directions Tighe might have contemplated pursuing in the plot of <title level="m">Selena</title> (the character Angela Harley never
                        visits Killarney, a crucial location in the fifth volume).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> This sonnet is one of the four poems clearly intended for
                                <title level="m">Selena</title> but not included in the novel. The other three are "Stanzas Written for Angela 1800," "Verses Written for
                            Angela 1804," and "Written for Angela." Additional poems such as "The Scissars a Riddle" seem to illustrate moments in the novel, as do several
                            sonnets, but are not definitively marked as <title level="m">Selena</title> poems.</note> Just as the tailpiece for “Sonnet XXII” images an
                        alternate narrative development for <title level="m">Selena</title>, Tighe’s dedicated sequence of <title level="m">Selena</title> poems in volume one
                        calls attention to the ways in which the characters Angela Harley and Lady Emily Trevallyn mirror one other’s emotional, sexual, and traumatic
                        situations via a cluster of six poems that modulate back and forth between their voices, from “The Picture Written for Angela. 1802” to “Elegy Written
                        for Emily 1802,” “Stanzas Written for Angela 1800” to “Verses Written for Emily 1799,” and “Verses Written for Angela 1804” to “Song to Oberon.”
                        Although Tighe’s mother claimed that Tighe completed <title level="m">Selena</title> by the end of 1803, the dating of “Verses Written for Angela
                        1804”—not printed in the manuscript of the novel—indicates that Tighe continued thinking about and working on <title level="m">Selena</title> after
                        1803; and the tailpiece’s illustration of a child leaning against a monument inscribed to Angela (figure 8) offers an intriguing glimpse of different
                        outcomes Tighe might have considered.

                    <p> Just as <title level="m">Verses</title> documents Tighe's energetic participation in the verbal-visual print culture of the Romantic era, it showcases
                        Tighe's work as a translator with 37 verse imitations of classical and contemporary poetry and prose selections originally written in Latin, Greek,
                        Italian, French, and German (nearly one third of the total contents of the collection).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Not included in the 37 are
                            Tighe's imitations from the Bible ("Imitation. from Jeremiah Chap XXXI. Ver 15. Nov:<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> 1800" and "Psalm CXXX. Imitated.

                        notes that Tighe began translating French and Italian literature as a child under her mother's direction (252-3) and took up a serious course of Latin
                        studies after her marriage to Henry, whose daily instructions enabled her to translate "with his help, a variety of authors" (254). When and where
                        Tighe acquired knowledge of Greek and German is not known (and seemingly minimal), but her letters to Walker and her reading journal are rich resources
                        recording her lifelong study of Italian, the more linguistic aspects of her interest in antiquarian studies (including a belated attention to Gaelic),
                        and the degree to which members of her literary circle shared or commented upon each other's verse translations (notably Thomas Moore's Anacreon, Lady
                        Dacre's Petrarch, Henry Boyd's Dante, and Walker's Monti, among others).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Tighe’s letters to Joseph Cooper Walker,
                            MSS 1461/5-7, Trinity College Library, Dublin and Tighe’s reading journal, MS 4804, National Library of Ireland, Dublin.</note></p>
                    <p> The translations Tighe includes in <title level="m">Verses</title> do not simply showcase scholarship, however; they trace affinities with other
                        writers whose works and passions resonate with hers, offering a discreet or safe venue to express what might be otherwise inexpressible. While Tighe
                        only presents three translations from Petrarch in <title level="m">Verses</title>, those three imitations underscore the larger Petrarchan sensibility
                        that operates in so many of the translations and original poems, voiced from the position of the tormented lover who has lost at love, who desperately
                        struggles to resist succumbing to the emotional and spiritual paralysis of despair, who understands too well the danger of seeking solace and basing
                        poetry in memories of past pleasure, but whose very prayer to experience relief through forgetfulness undermines that potential relief by recalling the
                        source of present pain. Thus "Verses Imitated from Du Moustier" begins and ends with a command to forget, but the six stanzas between the opening and
                        closing injunction viscerally catalogue and make manifest all that is impossible to forget, not only transforming the more conventional listing of
                        Petrarchan physical attributes into affective experiences but showing how the wise and moral framework fails to regulate or contain emotional
                        embodiment:

                    Similarly, in "Verses Imitated from the Chev. Du Parney Il est tems mon Eleonore!&amp;c 1798" the lover repeatedly insists on the twinned duty of
                        parting and forgetting but through the course of the poem comes to understand that absence will not produce oblivion: "Accustom'd to this cruel pain /
                        My heart may absence learn to bear, / But still thy image shall retain / 'Till life shall throb no longer there!" (37-40). And just so the fervent plea
                        for oblivion versus a hopeless wish for the return of a lost beloved’s affection that materializes in Tighe's translation of Catullus's "Si qua
                        recordanti" (<title level="m">Carmina</title> 76) — "I ask not Heaven with purely, constant fire / That cold and faithless bosom to inspire, / My own
                        relief is all I now implore, / This suffering soul at last to health restore; / From these indignant pangs in mercy save, / And steep my anguish in
                        oblivion's wave" (33-38) — is answered in her translation of Metastasio's "Il Primo Amore," which once again shows the impossibility of forgetting: 
                    <quote><lg><l>In vain to seek relief I fly,</l>
                    <l rendition="#indent1"> To secret shades, or crowds, or noise,</l>

                    <lg><l>Ah! what avails corporeal flight?</l>

                    <l rendition="#indent1"> And busy memory bids me mourn. (29-36)</l></lg></quote>
                    Like Petrarch, Parny, Dumoustier, or Metastasio, many of Tighe's greatest lyrics set out to offer peaceful resolutions to tortured souls but ultimately
                        reincarnate loss (and sometimes perversely exult in the intense emotion that reincarnation produces): the lost romantic joy of "The Faded Flowers," the
                        dead child of "Verses Written at the Commencement of Spring. 1802," the silent harp of "Address to my Harp," the mourning lover of "Verses Written at
                        the Devil's Bridge in Cardigan," or the formerly exiled friend of "To ----," whose glance reawakens every hushed feeling, so that "Once more my melting
                        heart with love o'erflows, / Laments its former loss, and weeps forgotten woes" (lines 31-32).</p>
                    <p> The Petrarchan sensibility that underscores so many of the translations provides an even more important trajectory in shaping the arc of the sonnet
                        cycle, which also owes a great deal to Smith in beginning with a set of nine elegiac poems that lament lost love and youth as well as the teasing power
                        of memory to provide the illusion of a return to the past that therein deepens the pain of the present. The cycle continues by turning from the
                        temporary and deeply problematic panacea of memory to more enduring possibilities: the passage of time that lessens all loss (X), the coming of death,
                        which loosens all ties (XI), and the production of poetry, which potentially transforms the present into eternity (XII-XV, which directly invoke
                        Petrarch and Bowles). With the turn to poetry as the pivot point of the cycle, Tighe looks to present pleasures, contemplating solace in the calm of
                        domestic love and the possibility of creating new memories and moments in the now of Rossana and Killarney (XVI-XX). But it is sonnet XXI's address to
                        William Hayley's biographical representation of William Cowper and Mary Unwin that provides transition to the cycle's most dramatic shift as Tighe
                        suddenly introduces a named speaker for XXII and XXIII—the tragic <title level="m">Selena</title> character Angela Harley—who vocalizes experiences
                        and perspectives that sound exactly like those informing the regrets and longings of the unnamed speaker of the first nine sonnets. Rather than a coded
                        regression to the torments of the past, Tighe's use of a named persona marks her staging her progressive journey as a poet who has learned how to
                        sublimate and recast the seemingly autobiographical as art. Though Tighe only marks XXII and XXIII as "Written for Angela 1802," and designates XXVI as
                        an Angela poem through the tailpiece, XXIV, XXV, XXVII, XXVIII and XXIX easily fit the framework and plot of <title level="m">Selena</title>.<note
                            place="foot" resp="editors"> Tighe only prints one of the sonnets written expressly for Angela in <title level="m">Selena</title>—XXIII—and has
                            the narrator declare that it serves "as a specimen of the whole" (493).</note> The introduction of Angela as an external persona masterfully
                        complicates the performing identity Tighe constructs for the last third of the sonnet cycle until she firmly re-establishes herself as speaking subject
                        in the final sonnet "XXX. Addressed to my Brother 1805," which concludes both the sonnet cycle and the first volume of <title level="m">Verses</title>.

                    This sonnet's acknowledgment of the fragility of mortality and the grateful appreciation it expresses for an interested reader even as Tighe is
                        transcribing <title level="m">Verses</title> serves as a powerful forerunner to the sonnet to Lady Dacre that will ultimately conclude <title level="m"
                            >Verses</title> as a whole to insist on Mary Tighe's identity as poet.</p>

                        her place in the literary, visual, material, and cultural productions of Romanticism. Its rich array of sonnets, translations, illustrations, political
                        poems, coterie poems, poems for <title level="m">Selena</title>, and references to contemporary poets and poetics not only showcases Tighe's power as a
                        lyric poet, it foregrounds her representation of herself as a lyric poet, just as she foregrounds herself as a visionary poet in <title level="m"
