                            states "The myrtle was planted by the author's aunt Mary, at West-Aston, the seat of Thomas Acton, esq. in the county of Wicklow. The 'beloved
                            brother' was the author's father, the Reverend William Blachford, who died after a very short illness in the meridian of life, a few months after
                            the birth of his daughter. The myrtle was destroyed by frost in the winter of 1807, notwithstanding the care of Mrs. Acton, who is addressed in
                            this poem by her Christian name of Sydney" (313-14).</note>

               <l>Yes, I remember the dear, suffering Saint</l>
               <l>Whose hand, with fond commemorative care,</l>
               <l>Planted that myrtle on my natal day.</l>
               <l>It was a day of joy to him she lov'd</l>
               <l>Best upon earth; and still her gentle heart,</l>
               <l>That never felt one passion's eager throb,</l>
               <l>Nor aught but quiet joys, and patient woes,</l>
               <l>Was prompt to sympathise with all, and most</l>
               <l>With that beloved brother: She had hop'd</l>
               <l> Perchance, that, fondly on his arm reclin'd</l>
               <l>In placid happiness, her feeble step</l>
               <l>Might here have wander'd thro' these friendly shades,</l>
               <l>This hospitable seat of kindred worth,</l>
               <l>And that the plant thus rear'd, in future years,</l>
               <l>Might win his smile benignant; when her hand</l>
               <l>Should point where, in its bower of loveliness,</l>
               <l>Bright spreading to the sun its fragrant leaf,</l>

               <l>His Mary's myrtle bloom'd. Ah me! 'tis sad</l>
               <l>When sweet affection thus designs in vain,</l>
               <l> And sees the fragile web it smiling spun</l>
               <l>For playful Love, crush'd by the sudden storm</l>
               <l>And swept to dark oblivion, mid the wreck</l>
               <l>Of greater hopes! Ev'n while she thought of bliss,</l>
               <l>Already o'er that darling brother's head,</l>
               <l>The death commission'd Angel noiseless wav'd</l>
               <l>His black &amp; heavy wings: and tho' she mourn'd</l>
               <l>That stroke, in pious sorrow, many a year,</l>
               <l>Yet even then, the life-consuming shaft</l>
               <l>In her chaste breast she uncomplaining bore.</l>
               <l> Now, both at rest, in blessed peacefulness,</l>
               <l>With no impatient hope, regret, or doubt,</l>
               <l>Await that full completion of the bliss</l>
               <l>Which their more perfect spirits shall receive.</l>

               <l>Its aromatic breath: for other eyes</l>
               <l>Blush'd the soft folded buds, &amp; other hands</l>
               <l>Pruned its luxuriant branches; friendship still </l>
               <l>Preserv'd the fond memorial, nay even yet</l>

               <l> The blighted relic of what once it lov'd.</l>

               <l>The timid Spring, oft chill'd, and rudely check'd,</l>
               <l>At last unveil'd her tenderest charms, and smil'd </l>
               <l>With radiant blushes on her amorous train:</l>
               <l>But no reviving gale, no fruitful dew</l>
               <l>Visits the brown, parch'd leaf, or from the stem, </l>
               <l>The withering stem, elicits the young shoot</l>
               <l>With hopes of life, &amp; beauty; yet thy care, </l>
               <l> Perhaps, dear Sidney, thine assiduous care</l>
               <l>May save it still. What can resist the care</l>
               <l>Of fond assiduous love? Oh! it can raise</l>
               <l>The shudd'ring soul that sunk beneath the black, </l>
               <l>Suspended pall of Death! believe this lip,</l>
               <l>Believe this grateful heart, which best can feel</l>
