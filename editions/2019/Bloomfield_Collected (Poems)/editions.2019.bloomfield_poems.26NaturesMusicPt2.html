               <p><span class="smcaps">If</span> we look into Lempriere’s Classical Dictionary, we find that ‘Æolus, the King of Storms
                  and Winds, was the son of Hippotas: he reigned over Æolia

                           sea, or the seven islands lying between Sicily and Italy, now called the Lipari islands,
                           which Virgil calls the kingdom of Æolus, the God of Storms and Winds.</span></div>
                  </div>; and because he was the inventor of sails, and a great astronomer, the poets have
                  called him the God of the Wind. It is said that he confined in a bag, and gave Ulysses,
                  all the winds that could blow against his vessel when he returned to Ithaca. The companions
                  of Ulysses untied the bag, and gave the winds their liberty. Æolus was indebted to
                  Juno for his royal dignity, according to Virgil.’</p>
            </div>
            <p class="noCount">I am not disposed to covet the powers of this poet-made god, except in one particular,
               that of confining the wind in a bag; which would be extremely convenient on a sultry
               summer’s day, when not a breath of air is in motion: for, in the confined situation
               in which I live, surrounded almost by buildings which have started <span class="ital">literally </span>out of the earth they cover, I often feel regret that, when my friends call, none
               but Æolus himself can oblige them with the vibration of a single string. But let them
               take the instrument to their villas, far from the smoke of London, and, though some
               may be found who will exclaim—</p>

            <p class="noCount">I think there will be a far greater proportion who will conceive in its tones the
               spirit of an anthem, and all the genuine fervour of praise. Yet it is equally true,
               that I have been jocosely told that Eolian harps are only adapted to send lazy people
               to sleep, and to give the unguarded a crick in the neck.</p>
            <p class="noCount">A satisfactory account of this instrument may be found in Sir John Hawkins’s ‘General
               History of the Science and Practice of Music,’ published in 1776, in five volumes,
               4to.</p>
            <p class="noCount">In a preliminary discourse I find the following information:</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>‘The Harp of Æolus, as it is called, on which so much has been lately said and wrote,
                  was constructed by Kircher above a century ago, and is accurately described in his
                  Musurgia Universalis.’
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)

                  </div> And in vol. iv. p. 218, Sir John makes the following remark, together with a translated
                  extract from Kircher’s work:</p>
            </div>
            <p class="noCount">‘In book ix, in a chapter entitled <em>De Sympathia</em>, &amp;c. Kircher mentions a contrivance of his own, an instrument which a few years ago
               was obtruded upon the public as a new invention, and called the Harp of Æolus, of
               which he thus speaks:</p>
            <p class="noCount">As the following instrument is new, so also is it easy to construct, and pleasant;
               and is heard in my museum to the great admiration of every one. It is silent as long
               as the window in which it is placed remains shut, but, as soon as it is opened, behold
               an harmonious sound on the sudden arises, that astonishes the hearers: for they are
               not able to perceive from whence the sound proceeds, nor yet what kind of instrument
               it is, for it resembles neither the sound of a stringed, nor yet of a pneumatic instrument,
               but partakes of both. The instrument is made of pine wood; it is five palms long,
               two broad, and one deep; it may contain fifteen or more chords, all equal, and composed
               of the intestines of animals. </p>
            <p class="noCount">The method of tuning it now remains, which is not, as in other instruments, by thirds,
               fourths, fifths, or eighths; but all the chords are to be tuned to an unison, or in
               octaves. It is very wonderful, and nearly paradoxical, that chords thus tuned should
               constitute different harmony. As this musical phenomenon has not as yet been observed
               by any one that I know of, I shall describe the instrument very minutely, to the end
               that it may be searched into very narrowly, and the effects produced by it accounted
               for; but first I shall show the conditions of the instrument, and where it ought to
               be fixed.”</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>These conditions differ from modern usage; and it is worthy of remark that the length
                  of Kircher’s harp (if he called it a harp, for the name seems to be more modern) was
                  but five palms, or fifteen inches; which is not more than half the usual width of
                  our common sashes. That a greater length of string gives a sonorous and organ-like
                  tone to the instrument I know by experience, and therefore conclude that its power
                  and compass are thereby proportionably increased. Perhaps it is not impossible, or
                  unlikely, that improvements may still be made, and its powers called forth in a much
                  higher degree. Kircher goes on to describe a method of conducting the air through
                  the strings of his instrument by means of what he terms valves, or boards so placed
                  as to concentrate the breeze. This method I think too cumbersome and difficult to
                  be practised in a dwelling-house, except a window could be set apart on purpose: but
                  perhaps would answer in a garden, or open situation. I have made no attempt hitherto
                  to reduce it to practice: but as this is intended to be a book of extracts, I shall
                  proceed to another pleasing and circumstantial account of the Eolian harp, to be found
                  in Jones’ ‘Physiological Disquisitions,’ page 338.—1781.

               <p>‘It was observed above, that as action and reaction are equal, the effect is the same,
                  whether the sonorous body strikes the air, or the air strikes the sonorous body. In
                  the case of a musical pipe this is plain enough; but it was not so well known, nor
                  could it be so familiarly proved, till of late years, that the air can begin of itself
                  to produce the effect, and fetch music out of a string, as a string fetches music
                  out of the air. We have now a curious illustration of this fact from the instrument
                  called an Eolian harp. How far the ancients were masters of this experiment is uncertain;
                  but it has long been known that the wind would bring musical sounds from the strings
                  of an instrument. In the Jewish Talmud, where we should scarcely expect to find any
                  thing valuable in philosophy, the wind is reported to have brought music out of the
                  harp of David; which, as it is there said, “being every midnight constantly blown
                  upon by the north wind, warbled of itself”.

                  </div> a master of the violoncello, from North Britain, and an ingenious composer in the
                  Scotch style, who himself gave me the following account many years ago, when I was
                  under him as a practitioner in music. When he had received the hint of Mr. Pope’s
                  discovery in Eustathius, he determined to try whether he could reduce it to practice.
                  Accordingly, he took an old lute, and put strings upon it; he exposed it to the wind
                  in every manner he could think of; but all without effect. When he was about to give
                  the matter up as a mystery or a fable, he received some encouragement to a farther
                  trial from an accident which happened to a harper on the Thames; who, having his instrument
                  with him in a house-boat, perceived that a favourable stroke of the wind brought some
                  momentary sounds from the strings, as if they had been suddenly touched after that
                  manner, which, from the genius of this instrument, is called <span class="ital">arpeggio</span>. The man was alarmed with the accident, and made many trials to procure a repetition
                  of the same sounds from a like turn of the wind, but could never succeed; the music
                  was vanished like an apparition. Upon this ground, however, Mr. Oswald persevered;
                  and it came at last into his mind, that perhaps the strings ought to be exposed to
                  a more confined current of air. With this view he drew up the sash of his chamber-window,
                  so as to let in a shallow stream of air, and exposed his lute to it. In the middle
                  of the night the wind rose, and the instrument sounded; which being heard by the artist,
                  he sprang out of bed to examine all the circumstances of its situation, and noted
                  down every thing with the most scrupulous precision; after which, as the principle
                  was now ascertained, he never failed of the effect.

                           III]; that two wires, stretched across an area before a house at London, had been
                           heard to make very fine music, equal to the best Eolian harp. </span></div>
                  </div>
               </p>
            </div>
            <p class="noCount">The construction of an Eolian harp is very simple. Nothing more is necessary than
               a long and narrow box of deal, with a thin belly, and eight or ten strings of catgut
               lightly stretched over two bridges, placed near the extremities, and all tuned in
               unison. When it plays, the unison itself is plainly heard as the lowest tone, and
               the combinations of concords, though consisting chiefly of the <span class="ital">harmonic </span>notes, are by no means confined to them, but change, as the wind is more or less intense,
               with a variety and sweetness which is past description. I know not how to account
               for the compass of its notes on the principles of the harmonics but by admitting a
               new species of sounds, which I call <span class="ital">harmonics of the harmonics</span>; or, <span class="ital">secondary harmonics</span>. The sharp seventh is very commonly heard, which, if deduced as an harmonic, must
               be of the second species, as the 17th of the 12th; as also the 9th, which is as frequently
               heard, may be taken for the 12th of the 12th; and thus perhaps we may account for
               all its varieties.</p>
            <p class="noCount">If we consider the quality of its harmony, it very much resembles that of a chorus
               of voices at a distance, with all the expressions of the <span class="ital">forte</span>, the <span class="ital">piano</span>, and the <span class="ital">swell</span>; in a word, its harmony is more like to what we might imagine the aërial sounds of
               magic and enchantment to be, than to artificial music. We may call it, without a metaphor,
               the music of inspiration.</p>
            <p class="noCount">With respect to the peculiar nature and causes of this phenomenon, I dare not promise
               entire satisfaction from my own speculations, being well aware of the difficulty.
               The principles I shall offer for solving this wonderful effect are founded on the
               analogy between light and air.</p>
            <p class="noCount">1. And first I lay it down, that music is in air as colours are in light. When any
               body inflects the rays of light, or refracts them, it does not give the colours that
               are seen, but it makes the light give them; so a sonorous body does not give musical
               sounds, but makes the air give them.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>2. That as colours are produced by inflections and refractions of the rays of light;
                  so musical sounds are produced by similar refractions of the air. There is no reason
                  to suppose that air is homogeneous in its parts any more than light; and if air consists
                  of heterogeneous parts, they will be differently refrangible, according to their magnitudes,
                  and excite different sounds, as they are accommodated to different vibrations, and
                  capable of different velocities; as the parts of light which are differently refrangible
                  give different colours. The parts of air most refrangible will excite the most acute
                  sounds, and the smallest parts will be most refrangible.

                           of air occurred to Mr. Derham [William Derham (1657–1735)]; who argued, that as sound
                           moves near 1200 feet in a second, and the most violent wind not more than sixty miles
                           in an hour, which is at the rate of eighty-eight feet in a second, the particles of
                           air which communicate sound must be more subtile than those which constitute the winds.

            <p class="noCount">3. That as light shows no particular colour but by means of some other intervening
               body to separate and modify its rays, so the air yields no particular musical tone
               without the assistance of some sonorous body to separate its parts, and put them into
               a vibratory motion.</p>
            <p class="noCount">4. That as light is refracted into colours, not only on dioptric principles, by passing
               through a prism of glass, or some other refracting medium, but also by passing near
               the edge of some solid body which inflects it out of its course; so is the air subject
               to be refracted by a similar inflection. It would require much time and observation,
               more than I have had leisure to bestow, to expand this principle into a theory, and
               confirm it by proper experiments; but the fact seems clear, that sound is produced,
               and that air becomes <span class="ital">vocal</span> on this principle of a <span class="ital">refraction</span>. As the Eolian harp plays by an inflection of a current of air over the edge of an
               aperture, so the column of air in an organ-pipe becomes vocal by means of a shallow
               current which strikes against the edge of the aperture, and is thence inflected into
               the cavity of the pipe. In the German flute also, the breath gives the tone by passing
               over the edge of the aperture; and according to its intensity, it produces higher
               or lower tones as the wind does in the Eolian harp. It would be endless to pursue
               this effect under all the various shapes in which it appears to us. It is sufficient
               for our purpose, that we have many instances in which air becomes vocal and musical
               by suffering a kind of refraction against the edge of some solid bodies; for this
               is the case with the Eolian harp; the wind passes to the strings of the instrument
               by the edge of an aperture; whence it is inflected partly at a greater, partly at
               a lesser angle; and that portion of the current of air which makes a different angle
               with the plane in which the strings lie, excites a different tone.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This hypothesis for the solution of Eolian sound, by a refraction of the air, is recommended
                  by an experiment, which demonstrates that such a relation between air and light, as
                  we have here supposed, is not imaginary. For as light when refracted affords us seven
                  colours, and no more; so the air yields seven degrees of sound within the system of
                  the octave; of which all successive sounds, however multiplied, are but repetitions.
                  I met with this comparison in an ancient English author; but the sagacity of Newton
                  hit upon it in his optical experiments, and he has carried it much further, by showing
                  us that the analogy extends even to the respective intervals of each. The prismatic
                  spectrum, under his accurate examination of it, was found to exhibit the same degrees
                  with the series of tones and semitones in an octave; but they do not answer to the
                  degrees of the octave either in a flat or sharp key, as these keys are commonly now
                  used; because the third is minor and the sixth major. However, these degrees of the
                  optical octave may be justified, and the old masters have composed according to them;
                  of which we have an instance in the old creed of Tallis;
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note14" id="Note14_return"><sup class="super">
                           (14)

                  </div> and there are many others. The diatonic scale affords us two octaves with the minor
                  third, which differ in their degrees; the one from A to A, with the minor third and
                  minor sixth; the other from D to D, with the minor third and major sixth. This latter
                  has the advantage in two respects: First, It is more simple and natural, because the
                  two tetrachords which make up the octave are similar; that is, they both have the
                  hemitone in the same place, as it happens in the two tetrachords of the major key.
                  Second, It leads to a greater variety of modulation; and though the harmonies by some
                  are accounted harsh, yet, in my opinion, they are more stately and pleasing than in
                  the flat key with its two dissimilar tetrachords, as now managed by modern masters;
                  who have entirely dropped the other form, though it has excellencies peculiar to itself,
                  and therefore deserves to be retained.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="noCount">The analogy between sounds and colours is very strict, and may be carried very far.
               In the order of the seven colours, three of them are simple and primary, the <span class="ital">red</span>, the <span class="ital">yellow</span>, and the <span class="ital">blue</span>; so in the seven degrees of the octave, there are three principal tones which constitute
               its harmony, the <span class="ital">unison</span>, the <span class="ital">third</span>, and the <span class="ital">fifth</span>; and these have the same places in the series as the three simple colours have in
               the prismatic spectrum; <span class="ital">red </span>is in the place of the <span class="ital">unison</span>, <span class="ital">yellow </span>in the place of the <span class="ital">third</span>, and <span class="ital">blue </span>in the place of the <span class="ital">fifth. </span>All harmony, though the parts are ever so many, is made up of these three sounds,
               as all hues are composed of those three colours.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Upon the whole, the Eolian harp may be considered as an air-prism, for the physical
               separation of musical sounds. The form of it may be improved, so as to give a farther
               illustration to the principles I have adopted. Instead of fixing the strings to the
               outside, I dispose them upon a sounding board, or belly, within side a wooden case,
               and admit the wind to them through a horizontal aperture, so that the affinity of
               the instrument to an organ-pipe appears at first sight; and thus it becomes portable
               and useful any where in the open air, instead of being confined to the house; which
               is a great advantage; and it is probable this new form may lead hereafter to some
               new experiments.</p>
            <p class="noCount">No person of a musical ear can listen to the Eolian harp without discovering that
               the sound varies with the <span class="ital">intensity </span>of the wind. The unison with a sudden gust will change immediately into the octave
               on the same string; which happens in other instruments: the common and German flutes
               give the octaves with a more intense blast of the breath. What seemed to me most inexplicable
               of all was this, that if the Eolian harp is exposed to the air with a single string,
               that string, without any change in its situation, will be heard to sound all the harmonic
               notes, which are seven or eight, besides the unison; and several of them will be heard
               at the same time. When many strings, which the wind meets at different angles, sound
               together, we have not only the harmonics of the unison variously produced, but harmonics
               of the harmonics, as above mentioned.’</p>
            <p class="noCount">Mr. Jones has given plates to illustrate his subject, and mentions, in a note, that,
               of his portable harp, he sent a model, on a small scale, to Messrs. <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LongmanThomasN">Longman </a> and Broderip, with orders for its being constructed for sale. Although I have never
               seen one of that construction, I readily perceive the advantages which he ascribes
               to them, and hope some day to prove it by experience.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The harps I have hitherto made have been, though of greater length, on the same principle
               with those seen at the music shops; but, where circumstances would admit of it, I
               have endeavoured to divide the strings into separate octaves. I have however proved,
               at least to my own satisfaction, that the top, or covering board, is of little use,
               if any, and that the strings ought to catch the wind in an inclination more approaching
               to a perpendicular than to a horizontal level. For this reason, I suppose, I find
               the instrument, when placed with the strings towards the window, always performs better
               than in the usual position. </p>
            <p class="noCount">Strings covered with silver wire I have tried in various ways, but am not prepared
               to say whether they perform their part. Perhaps the metallic covering is not adapted
               to the action of the breeze. Strings covered with oil will not sound. Silk strings
               will give a most delicate tone, but I never yet could make them stand to their tension.
               </p>
            <p class="noCount">I have tried catgut about the size, or larger than the third string of the violin,
               but being strained to only the width of a common sash, they appeared to want <span class="ital">length </span>in proportion to their <span class="ital">diameter</span>, and therefore I conclude, that could such strings be placed at the length of eight
               or ten feet, so as to catch a current of wind, the effect would be increased proportionably.
               But as I am no musician, I advance this conjecture with diffidence, remembering that
               I have been repeatedly disappointed in my expectations, and as often found results
               that have been beyond my comprehension.</p>

               the warbling brook, and all the concert of the wood. The soft and tender notes of
               peace and love were swelled up with the most delicate and insensible transition, into
               a loud hymn of triumph and exultation, joined by the deep-toned organ, and a full
               choir of voices, which gradually decayed upon the ear until it died away in distant

               in enlarging upon it is, <span class="ital">because no one had given any description of it before </span>(De Sympathiae et Antipathiae Sonorum ratione, b. ix.).—The knowledge of the operation
               of air upon strings is doubtless of very high antiquity; allusions are made to it
               in the Talmud and Eustathius, and an anecdote from Lucian will sufficiently illustrate
               the remark.</p>

                  thrown into the river Hebrus, with his bleeding head upon it. The harp, touched with
                  the wind, breathed forth a solemn strain. Still swimming down the Egean sea, the mournful
                  concert arrived at Lesbos, where the inhabitants, taking them up, buried the head
                  where now stands the Temple of Bacchus, and suspended the lyre in the Temple of Apollo.”

                  fine and harmonious sounds seemed to come from such a distance as to make me believe,
                  for some time, that the natives were entertaining themselves with their music, on
                  the other side of the road, and near five thousand toises from the place where I stood.

                  </div> My ear was much deceived as to the distance, for I was not fifty toises from the instrument.
                  It was a bamboo, at least sixty feet in height, fixed in a vertical position, close
                  to the sea. Between every joint was a hole near an inch and two-tenths long, and somewhat
                  above half an inch broad. These holes formed so many mouths, which, by the action
                  of the wind, emitted agreeable and varied sounds. As the joints of this long bamboo
                  were very numerous, care had been taken to pierce it in different directions; so that,
                  from whatever point the wind blew, it always meets with some holes. The sound of this
                  instrument more nearly resembles that of the harmonica than any other to which I can

               if ten men are enamoured of the same thing, and describe it with a feeling mind and
               appropriate language, can it be wonderful that their verses should exhibit a similarity?

               worthy of an ode; and a note attached to the piece is worth remarking, as its statement

               III]; that two wires, stretched across an area before a house at London, had been

         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">[Jones’s note:] This notion concerning the different degrees of subtilty in the parts
               of air occurred to Mr. Derham [William Derham (1657–1735)]; who argued, that as sound
               moves near 1200 feet in a second, and the most violent wind not more than sixty miles
               in an hour, which is at the rate of eighty-eight feet in a second, the particles of
               air which communicate sound must be more subtile than those which constitute the winds.
               See Hales’ Doctr. Son. p. 47. [William Hales (1747–1831), <em>Sonorum Doctrina Rationalis et Experimentalis</em> (1778)]. If wind acts by the grosser parts of air, and sound by the finer, this may
               be a reason why they do not interfere nor disturb one another’s motions.*<br/><br/> [Bloomfield’s note:] * The following is taken from an old book published before Sir
               Isaac Newton received the honour of knighthood.<br/><br/> Mr. Isaac Newton demonstrates (in prop. 43, book ii. of his Principles) that sounds,
               because they arise from the tremulous motion of bodies, are nothing else but the propagation
               of the pulse of the air, and this, he saith, is confirmed by those great tremors that
               strong and grave sounds excite in bodies round about; as the ringing of bells, noise
               of cannon, &amp;c.<br/><br/> And in another place he concludes, that sounds do not consist in the motion of any
               aether, or finer air, but in the agitation of the whole common air; because he found
               by experiments, that the motion of sounds depended on the density of the whole air.’—Harris’
               Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, printed in 1704. R. B. [John Harris (1666–1719),
