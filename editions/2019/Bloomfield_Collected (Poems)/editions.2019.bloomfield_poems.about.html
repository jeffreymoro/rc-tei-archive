               <h2><span class="head">About This Edition</span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">Admired by Wordsworth and Southey, called by Clare 'the greatest Pastoral Poet England
                  ever gave birth too’, Robert Bloomfield was one of the bestselling poets of the nineteenth
                  century. A labouring-class writer famed for his rural verse, Bloomfield was not only
                  a major influence on Clare but also a children’s author, playwright, tourist writer,
                  and literary critic. <em>The Collected Writings of Robert Bloomfield</em> is the first ever scholarly edition of his entire oeuvre. The editors have collated
                  all the lifetime editions of his publications, making it possible as never before
                  to study the range of his work and the many revisions it underwent. The poems’ textual
                  histories are displayed in variants, editorial footnotes and explanatory introductions.
                  The literary and biographical contexts are discussed, as are the works' critical receptions
                  and publication histories. The effect on his publications of Bloomfield’s vexed position,
                  caught between the traditional expectations of a patron and the demands of a commercial
                  bookseller is detailed. As a result, it is now possible to see Bloomfield both as
                  a major nature poet and as a dramatic illustration of the new pressures on the author
                  caused by the expansion of print culture in the Romantic era. <em>The Collected Writings</em> takes its place alongside the other Bloomfield resources on Romantic Circles—the
                  Electronic Editions of his <em>Letters</em> and of his poem/tour journal/sketchbook <em>The Banks of Wye</em>—and the essay collection ‘The inestimable blessing of letters’.</p>

               <p class="noCount">This edition was TEI-encoded by Averill Buchanan under the direction of the edition's
                  editors. David Rettenmaier, Romantic Circles Technical Editor, further modified the
                  TEI markup to conform to RC house style; he also designed the accompaning graphic
                  banner. Laura Mandell and Dave Rettenmaier developed the modified versions of the
                  transforms provided by the TEI that were used to convert the TEI files into HTML.
                  TEI renders text archival quality for better preservation and future access. </p>
