              to be recommended. Such was the prevalent opinion some years back. It is less general now: and I am sure the humanity of the Author, and
              his benevolence to Animals in general, will dispose him to rejoice in whatever plea can be offered in stay of execution of this
              sentence. And yet more so, if it shall appear that <hi rend="smcaps">Rooks</hi>, at least, deserve not only mercy, but <hi rend="ital"

              as the embellishments cut in wood are beautiful… It is this.</p><p rend="noCount">Speaking of Birds of the <hi rend="smcaps">Pie-kind</hi> in general, he
                says ‘Birds of this kind [p. 63] are found in every part of the known world, from Greenland to the Cape of Good Hope. In many respects
                they may be said to be of singular benefit to mankind: principally by destroying great quantities of noxious insects, worms, and
                reptiles. <hi rend="smcaps">Rooks</hi>, in particular, are fond of the erucæ of <hi rend="ital">the hedge-chaffer, </hi>or chesnut <hi
                  rend="ital">brown beetles </hi>for which they search with indefatigable pains. These insects,’ he adds in a note, ‘appear in hot
                weather in formidable numbers: disrobing the fields and trees of their verdure, blossoms, and fruit; spreading desolation and
                destruction wherever they go…They appeared in great numbers in <hi rend="smcaps">Ireland</hi> during a hot summer, and committed great
                ravages. In the year 1747 whole meadows and corn-fields were destroyed by them in <hi rend="smcaps">Suffolk</hi>. The decrease of
                Rookeries in that County was thought to be the occasion of it. The many Rookeries with us is in some measure the reason why we have so
                few of these destructive animals.’ [Wallis’s History of Northumberland.]</p>
              <p rend="noCount">‘Rooks,’ he subjoins, ‘are often accus’d of feeding on the corn just after it has been sown, and various contrivances have been made
                both to kill and frighten them away; but, in our estimation, the advantages deriv’d from the destruction which they make among grubs,
                earth-worms, and noxious insects of various kinds, will greatly overpay the injury done to the future harvest by the small quantity of
                corn they may destroy in searching after their favourite food’. [Lofft further notes:] Mr. Bewick does not seem to have been quite
                aware that much of the mischief, as I have been informed by a sensible neighbouring Farmer and Tenant, is done in the grub-state of
                the chaffer by biting through the <hi rend="ital">roots </hi>of grass, &amp;c. A latent, and imperceptibly, but rapidly spreading
                mischief, against which the <hi rend="ital">rooks </hi>and birds of similar instinct are, in a manner, the sole protection. C. L.]</p>
              <p rend="noCount">‘In general they are sagacious, active, and faithful to each other. They live in pairs; and their mutual attachment is constant. They
                are a clamorous race: mostly build in trees, and form a kind of society in which there appears something like a regular government. A
                Centinel watches for the general safety, and gives notice on the appearance of danger.’</p><p rend="noCount">Under the Title, ‘<hi rend="smcaps"
                  >Rooks</hi>,’ (p. 71) Mr. <hi rend="smcaps">Bewick</hi> repeats his observations on the useful property of this Bird.</p><p rend="noCount">I
                confess myself solicitous for their safety and kind treatment. We have two which were lam’d by being blown down in a storm (a calamity
                which destroys great numbers almost every spring). One of them is perfectly domesticated. The other is yet more remarkable; since
                although enjoying his natural liberty completely, he recognizes, even in his flights at a distance from the house, his adoptive home,
                his human friends, and early protectors.</p><p rend="noCount">The <hi rend="smcaps">Rook</hi> is certainly a very beautiful and very sensible Bird;
                very confiding, and very much attach’d. It will give me a pleasure, in which I doubt not the Author of this delightful Poem will
                partake, if any thing here said shall avail them with the Farmer; and especially with the <hi rend="smcaps">Suffolk Farmer</hi>. C.
