        <anchor xml:id="wildflowers-intro"/><p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">Introduction</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0"><title>Wild Flowers; or, Pastoral and Local Poetry </title>(1806) was Bloomfield’s third collection. Slighter than its
          predecessor, <title>Rural Tales</title>, it continued in the same vein, comprising tales and ballads telling stories of villagers and
          village customs, loco-descriptive poems on local places and sentimental songs. To this familiar mixture Bloomfield added an ode, of
          sorts—‘To My Old Oak Table’, in which, in a lengthy prosopopeia, he addressed his writing desk and pondered the passing of time. <title>Wild
            Flowers</title> also collected the poem on vaccination, <title>Good Tidings; or, News from the Farm </title>that had been published alone
          in 1804.</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The poems dated from the four-year period since <title>Rural Tales</title>, and they reflect Bloomfield’s
          professionalization. Having given up his shoemaking trade, and having been plied with books by literary gentlefolk who came to visit him, he
          had read more widely in poetry and poetics, and begun to formulate opinions concerning style and diction. Wordsworth was a positive
          influence, and Amelia Opie a negative one, as he explained in a letter to his brother of 2 September 1802 (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.94.html">Letter 94</ref>):</p>
        <quote>there is much truth in Wordsworth’s preface where he says that he had tried to come near the language of Men, and the language of Men
          is not backwards! I have a full persuasion that this is the greatest blemish of many poems, and has often a tendency to weaken the force of
          the line and diminish the ardour of the reader. Milton, no doubt, has done it to advantage; and when there comes another Milton he shall
          have my permission to do it too. Perhaps as inversions abound generally in sonnets, it may be the principal cause of my disrelish for
          them.</quote>
        <quote>The conclusion of poetical pieces, and the conclusion of sections and divisions therein certainly ought to improve, line by line, so as
          to finish with a twang, as the Boy said of his whip. A weak line at a close, is like a dying note of a weak voice when it should be full and
          sonorous; and full of soul; I could easily find instances but will leave the application to be made as you read whatever may next come into
          your hand.</quote>
        <quote>I have perhaps an unfounded aversion to tying three lines together in a measure where the ear expects but two. In Dryden’s Virgil I
          find it very frequent, and cannot see the advantage of it, you will of course not wonder that there are none to be found in what I have
          ventured into the world; and as I have thus far succeeded without, will not begin now.</quote>
        <quote>The choice of phrases in Ballads and Songs, and perhaps more in serious pieces, is of much importance; a common use of old worn out
          words I do not like, such as erst, whilom, and a thousand more; and yet to take up and use a word but just getting into circulation, newly
          adopted, or new coined, is like placing a new bright penny piece among a range of old ones, it will look like a broken rank, and besides run
          great hazard of rousing the risibility that arises from contempt rather than the smile due to true humour, suppose by way of illustrating
          this point, I had said originally in the Suffolk Ballad</quote>
          <quote>And laid aside her Lucks and twitches<lb/>
            And to the Hutch she reach’d her hand<lb/>
            And gave him out his Sunday <hi rend="ital">small-clothes</hi>! </quote>
        
        <quote>Perhaps <hi rend="ital">Breeches</hi> will one day be as old fashioned as doublet and jerkin, as in another case though the
          song says ‘With good old leathern bottle, and ale that looks so brown’ and yet I doubt that in another fifty years a leather bottle will not
          be found but in the song.</quote>
        <quote>Compound Epithets I do not much like; because they are often such as we never use in conversation; there are three in my
          ‘Word to the young ladies’ which I deem such as are often used in conversation, ‘full blown,’ ‘out-run’ but ‘half-expanded’ is not so
          common. In a poem by Mrs. Opie I find the following which are not used in conversation, Grief-impeded, fragrance-breathing, &amp;c and I
          think many may be found in most poems, but I am only telling you my notions of excellence, let every one chuse his own path.</quote>
      
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The poems in <title>Wild Flowers </title>practise what the letter preaches, completing a movement away from the Thomsonian
          diction of <title>The Farmer’s Boy</title> that had begun in <title>Rural Tales.</title> ‘Barnham Water’, is an instance. Written shortly
          after this avowal of Wordsworthian rustic plainness, it bears traces of a reading of <title>Lyrical Ballads</title>, being a first-person
          account of a journey on foot through a familiar landscape, told in colloquial diction and featuring rhetorical questions and reflections on
          the place’s effect on the speaker’s reflective mind:</p>

        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Certainly the poem had begun as Bloomfield knew ‘Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey’ had begun: he recorded in a
          letter that it was the unexpected beauty of the landscape, experienced when <hi rend="ital">revisiting</hi> the area on a misty autumn day,
          that moved him to write a description of an earlier visit in the heat of summer.</p>
        <quote>The morning I left Bury turn’d out very foggy, and I was glad that I had determined to ride inside. At about half past six
          there appear’d a compleat semicircle or rainbow nearly in the West, which was evidently produced by the sun on the fog, the colour was pale,
          and not varied or mix’d. I observed particularly that as we ascended the high ground on the south of Sudbury we gradually surmounted the fog
          and found a fine clear morning; and that it has not dissipated, but lay on a level with the hill, filling up the whole valley; and watching
          its motions I perceived at many miles distance that as the day advanced, the fog had made a sensible and collected elevation and become a
          cloud, moving I believe nearly south-west—… Barnham Water has set my brains a-gadding, and I fear I shall not get rid of the subject untill

        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The resultant poem seems almost self-consciously to consider embracing the role of the Wordsworthian nature-poet, only to
          stop at a self-erected barrier when Bloomfield concludes that his Muse is not fitted for lofty explorations of the imagination: the nature
          that moves him to verse is simply too flat and bare for Romanticism:</p>

        </lg>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">As when he withheld ‘To Immagination’ from publication, Bloomfield is evidently determined to set limits to his verse, to
          avoid using landscape description as a pretext to worship his own mind. Wordsworth was accused of puerility and egotism for doing so; a poet
          from the laboring classes was likely to attract even more damaging criticism of his pretensions.</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘Shooter’s Hill’ was written in spring 1803 when Bloomfield went on a walking excursion to escape from the stress that a new
          job in the busy Seal Office was causing him. This poem was also Wordsworthian in theme: the hill walk in the country is an escape from
          physically and mentally destructive city life:</p>

        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">But the simplicity and naivety of the confessional verse that follows, and the intimation of divinity in ‘the meanest flower

          <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent4">And revels in variety.</l>
        </lg>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">But again, Bloomfield recoils from identifying this insight with his own imaginative self, asserting instead that it is not
          for him to become the Bard of his native land:</p>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent3">Of Cambrian mountains still I dream,</l>

          <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent4">The wonders of my native land.</l>
        </lg>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">He ends by rejecting the vanity involved in wishing that his work will make him revered by future generations, but is this
          merely to accede to, rather than protest against, or attempt to transcend, a comparative confinement of view that is forced upon him by a
          social status that puts the freedom to travel, and the confidence to speak, out of reach? Does Bloomfield too easily reconcile himself, in
          the name of virtue, to deference? Blake, another London artisan, might have thought so. If he did, it is nevertheless true that ‘Shooter’s
          Hill’ and ‘Barnham Water’, in their astute deployment of the language of empowerment that Wordsworth derived from topographical verse, put
          on display both his desire to achieve and difficulty in achieving a voice of personal and national authority. Self-assertive and
          self-denying by turns, they reveal his attraction to and refusal of ‘the internalization of the quest romance’ and in so doing they are
          symptomatic of the struggle of labouring-class poets to escape the subjects—rural life and labour—on which they were expected (and were
          themselves accustomed) to write.</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">‘To My Old Oak Table’, begun in September and finished in December 1803, was more successful in maintaining a voice of
          personal authority than the topographical poems. The device of prosopopeia—speaking to an inanimate object—is justified by the symbolism of
          the table as being both a writing desk and a table for dining and household work. It places Bloomfield’s poetry, including this very poem,
          at the heart of family life, giving it the function of witnessing the joys and anxieties experienced over a span of years. Bloomfield gains
          confidence from this location, speaking frankly of poverty and illness, and their effect upon his mind and body, than ever before:</p>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent3">Thick fell the gathering terrors of Distress;</l>
          <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent3">Anxiety, and Griefs without a name,</l>

          <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent3">The creeping Dropsy, cold as cold could be,</l>
          <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent3">Unnerv’d my arm, and bow’d my head to thee.</l>
        </lg>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Writing of himself writing in and through this domestic setting, he presents himself as a Romantic poet more confidently
          than he had at Shooter’s Hill and Barnham Water:</p>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent3">I pour’d the torrent of my feelings forth;</l>
          <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent4">Conscious of <hi rend="ital">truth </hi>in Nature’s humble track,</l>
          <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent3">And wrote ‘The Farmer’s Boy’ upon thy back!</l>
        </lg>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Here Bloomfield does not undercut his portrait of himself as inspired: he derives his verse from a spontaneous overflow of
          powerful feelings that is enabled by the act of writing upon a table that has been a stable presence in his domestic life for years. It
          allows him to take pride in the power of his poetry to bring things to life, and to preserve them from harm: </p>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent3">Enough, old friend:—thou’rt mine; and shalt partake,</l>
          <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent4">While I have pen to write, or tongue to speak,</l>
          <l rend="noCount" rendition="#indent3">Whatever fortune deals me</l>
        </lg>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">This assertion of friendship is implicitly a self-vindication as a father and as a man. It is notable that the egotism of
          this, and the self-absorbed history of feeling growing from ordinary life that prepares for it, are achieved in the pentameter couplets he
          had used in <title>The Farmer’s Boy. </title>Bloomfield remained a master of the couplet form, here adapting it to sustain his strongest
          meditation on himself—thereby Romanticising an eighteenth-century form.</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Contrasting with the three first-person poems are three rural tales: ‘The Broken Crutch’, ‘The Horkey, and ‘Abner and the
          Widow Jones, a Familiar Ballad’. The last of these dates from August 1804, when Bloomfield notes that he was writing ‘a Ballad to be calld
          “the Ploughman,” in that stile in which I am best calculated to succeed’ (<ref
            target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.135.html">Letter 135</ref>). ‘That stile’ was comic and
          sentimental, in plain diction. The story concerns a middle-aged courtship and ends with a wedding. The ploughman gets the girl second time
          round, and the happy occasion is blessed when the farmer gives him his favourite old plough-horse, thus saving it from being killed for
          dog-meat. It’s a wish-fulfilment fantasy in which anxiety, poverty and social hierarchy are overcome: the rich help the poor and all ends
          happily. Bloomfield would write many tales of this kind, depicting villages as communities in which human need trumps financial
          self-interest and social division—moral economies. In ‘The Broken Crutch’ he even plays with the possibility of violence on the part of the
          labourers if their social superiors flagrantly infringe the traditional moral standards assumed to bind everyone in the community. But the
          spectre is raised only to be banished, as it turns out that the squire does not intend to seduce and abandon, but rather to marry, the lame
          labourer’s daughter. If these stories are sentimental, they are not merely fantastical. Bloomfield’s tales accord with Cobbett’s
            <title>Rural Rides </title>and Clare’s ‘Lament of Swordy Well’: each writer’s idealisation of the past as a better, kindlier place was
          rooted in experience of older ways of living being rapidly destroyed by the capitalisation of agriculture and resultant polarisation of
          social relations.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Raymond Williams, <title>The Country and the City </title>(London,
            1973).</note></p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Bloomfield suggests as much in ‘The Horkey’, his ballad about the festival held at harvest home, held at the squire’s and
          farmers’ expense, in which the labourers were encouraged, for one day a year, to eat, drink and party to excess. ‘These customs’, he wrote,
          ‘are going fast out of use; which is one great reason for my trying to tell the rising race of mankind that such were the customs when I was
          a boy’. Hone’s <title>Everyday Book </title>attempted a similar commemorative task, and proved very popular; Clare, inspired by Bloomfield,
          went on to celebrate the autumn festival of ‘St Martin’s Eve’. Clare’s poem was in one respect less authentic than Bloomfield’s: it did not,
          like ‘The Horkey’, use dialect words—a sign of Bloomfield’s taking further than before the Wordsworthian commitment to rural speech as a
          proper language for poetry. Terms such as ‘hake’, ‘sitch a mort’ and ‘cop’t’ required glossing in the notes: slang such as ‘by gom’ also
          featured, as did phonetically spelt corruptions like ‘arter’. This was highly unusual in polite verse printed in books, and relatively rare
          even in broadside ballads sold on the street: it aligned Bloomfield’s poetry with gossip, tale-telling and song-singing and with the tipsy
          tattler in the alehouse—a Burnsian turn that resonated differently in England, where a folk poet was not, as in Scotland, viewed as a
          revivalist of the national language against colonisation by southern English. <title>The Critical Review </title>was not alone in implying
          that such language was too vulgar for poetry—a complaint that Francis Jeffrey had made about <title>Lyrical Ballads </title>in 1802,
          although that collection included no labouring-class slang or Somerset dialect.</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The volume was completed by ‘Mary’s Evening Sigh’, a slight lyric first published in the <title>Monthly Mirror </title>in
          September 1802, by a comic poem on visiting Ranelagh Gardens, by a hunting song, and by the revised ‘Good Tidings’ which, in this context,
          took on new resonance because, like ‘To My Old Oak Table’, and the Dedication, it dwelt on illness and disability in Bloomfield’s own
          family. Bloomfield’s son <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon">Charles</ref> was lame, and in dedicating the volume to him he is both heartfelt and intimate to an unusual degree for a public
          format: ‘What a lasting, what an unspeakable satisfaction would it be to know that the Ballads, the Plowman Stories, and the “Broken Crutch”
          of your father would eventually contribute to lighten your steps to manhood, and make your own crutch, through life, rather a memorial of
          affection, than an object of sorrow’. The comic hero of ‘The Broken Crutch’ is helped by his brother to protect his daughter. The poems,
          that is, were Bloomfield’s paternalism in words, a fatherly legacy representing all he could do to lighten the burden of disability. The
          reader, at his point, feels as if intruding on a private, family affair: Bloomfield here presents himself and his family vulnerable, naked,
          an utter contrast to the framing of his poems and his life by patrons’ words in <title>The Farmer’s Boy </title>and<title> Rural
            Tales</title>.</p>

          suggestion was that he would help the sale of a second edition by prefacing it with a letter that Bloomfield had written to him in 1802 and
          with his own anecdotes about the poet (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.178.html">Letter
            178</ref>). The letter (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.75.html">Letter 75</ref>) was
          confessional—Bloomfield apologized in it for having been moved to tears by his own recitation of his verse. Longmans referred Buchan’s
          suggestion to Bloomfield who in turn sent it to <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LofftCapel">Lofft</ref>, seeking advice. Lofft replied that it was a handsome, if slightly vain, tribute and
          that to refuse to use it as the preface to the second edition would leave Bloomfield open to imputations of arrogance and ingratitude.</p>
        <quote>I trust I have as high &amp; as free a spirit as any man; yet, were Earl Buchan to wish to prefix to anything of mine a testimony such

        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Nevertheless, Bloomfield did decline to include it, giving <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BuchanLord">Buchan</ref> an explanation that is significant in that it reveals his
          quiet determination to speak directly to the reader without gentlemanly packaging. He would no longer be patronised, however well meaning
          the patron:</p>
        <quote>It will be observed that the Dedication to my Boy (who is eight years old this day) contains more meaning than is there exprest. I have
          with great truth spoken there of a ‘peculiar delicacy’, and I since feel it more than I did at that time. To adopt your plan, great and
          honourable as it is, would involve consequences that I cannot explain. One of the most difficult tasks that arises from my extraordinary
          situation, for such perhaps with great truth I may call it, is so to act as not to wound the feelings of my good and voluntary friends, nor
          to violate my own. The Letter I long ago addrest to your Lordship is such perhaps as I ought not to be ashamed of, and such that no person
          would believe me did I pretend to it. But though I feel the intended honour, I feel too, other sensations that many perhaps could suppress:
          I feel that it would be a violation of my notions of delicacy to print it now. My object has been to abide by the most simple methods of
          acquiring reputation, the standing alone, as far as my abilities go, and as far as it can be done in justice to my friends. Thus it has

          1806)</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Sales were a reason for Bloomfield’s feeling able to resist incorporating the recommendations of the great and good. He was
          able to tell <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BuchanLord">Buchan</ref> ‘A second edition of five thousand copies of “Wild Flowers”, is just now publishing’, meaning a first edition of that
          number was already close to selling out. Reviews were another reason: the consensus of the journals was that the collection proved
          Bloomfield’s consistency: he was no one-hit-wonder but a poet in command of his craft. Most praised ‘Good Tidings’; <title>The Monthly
            Magazine</title> especially admired the tales: ‘the genius and simplicity which marked the features of his first productions are equally
          observable in the poetry of the present volume. The Tale of the Broken Crutch, and the poem To my old Oak Table, are among the best of the
          local poetry mentioned in the title’ (24 Part 2 (1807), 629). The <title>Monthly Mirror</title> singled out the new emphasis on the poet
          himself, and his talent for comedy: ‘the humour with which it is intermixed, shews the poet under new circumstances, and the diffidence of
          his own abilities, perceivable in his former productions, is not so visible in the volume before us, which evinces an extraordinary portion
          of mental vigour and invention; and we can confidently predict, that so long as Mr. Bloomfield adheres to the present species of poetry, he
          need be under no apprehensions for the success of a “third,” or fourth “attempt”’ (21 (1806), 242–46). The <title>Critical Review</title> was
          more—critical—finding the prosopopeia of ‘To My Old Oak Table’ too extended to be credible and, echoing common criticisms of Wordsworth,
          judging the tales too commonplace and prosaic to be poetry:</p>
        <quote>There is a nerveless imbecility of conception which pervades the whole volume, a mediocrity of spirit which occasionally reaches a
          pretty thought, but never ventures to one that is bold or energetic. Without enthusiasm what is poetry? It is prose, not run mad, but
          unworthily held in the fetters of rhyme. The frenzy of inspiration, whether truly or falsely poetical, may for the peace and good order of
          the king’s English, be entrusted to the manacles of verse; but wherefore should trite thoughts and poor innocent expressions, guiltless of
          all fire and fury, be abridged of their natural liberty, and ‘<hi rend="ital">deprosed</hi>’ into rhyme? To versify such thoughts is like
          consigning a palsied patient to a keeper and a strait waistcoat.</quote>

        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">This review did not damage sales: new editions were issued in 1809 by <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#VernorThomas">Vernor</ref>, <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#HoodThomas">Hood</ref> and <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#SharpeC">Sharpe</ref>, and in 1812 by a combination

          copyright; Bloomfield kept the other half. In 1816 a further edition was released in which <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LongmanThomasN">Longman</ref>, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown were joined
          by Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy, by Darton, Harvey, &amp; Co.; and by Walker and Edwards. The last lifetime edition was that of 1819: Walker
          and Edwards were superseded by J. Booker; G. Cowie &amp; Co.; and Edwards and Knibb. The collection was still selling in the 1820s and a
          posthumous edition, negotiated by Bloomfield’s daughter Hannah, appeared in 1826. It was published, collected with <title>The Farmer’s Boy
          </title>and <title>Rural Tales</title>, many times in the 1830s and 1840s after copyright lapsed. All of the poems in <title>Wild Flowers</title>, with the exception of <title>Good Tidings</title>, which was included in a separate volume with <title>The Farmer’s Boy</title>, were reprinted in the second volume of the Stereotype edition (1809).</p>

        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0"> <hi rend="smcaps">In</hi> <hi rend="ital">thus addressing myself to you, and in expressing my regard for your person, my anxiety for your health,
            and my devotion to your welfare, I enjoy an advantage over those dedicators who indulge in adulation;—I shall at least be
          believed.</hi></p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0"><hi rend="ital">Should you arrive at that period when reason shall be mature, and affection or curiosity induce you to look
            back on your father’s poetical progress through life, you may conclude that he had many to boast as friends, whose names, in a dedication,
            would have honoured both him and his children; but you must also reflect, that to particularize such friends was a point of peculiar
            delicacy. The earliest patron of my unprotected strains has the warm thanks which are his due, for the introduction of blessings which
            have been diffused through our whole family, and nothing will ever change this sentiment. But amidst a general feeling of gratitude, which
            those who know me will never dispute, I feel for you, Charles, what none but parents can conceive; and on your account, my dear boy, there
            can be no harm in telling the world that I hope these ‘Wild Flowers’ will be productive of sweets of the worldly kind; for your
            unfortunate lameness (should it never be removed) may preclude you from the means of procuring comforts and advantages which might
            otherwise have fallen to your share. </hi></p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0"><hi rend="ital">What a lasting, what an unspeakable satisfaction would it be to know that the Ballads, the Plowman Stories,
            and the ‘Broken Crutch’ of your father would eventually contribute to lighten your steps to manhood, and make your own crutch, through
            life, rather a memorial of affection, than an object of sorrow. </hi></p>

        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">PREFACE</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0"> <hi rend="smcaps">A man</hi> of the first eminence, in whose day (fortunately perhaps for me) I was not destined to appear before the public, or to
          abide the Herculean crab-tree of his criticism, Dr. Johnson, has said, in his preface to Shakspeare, that— ‘Nothing can please many, and
          please long, but just representations of general nature.’ My representations of nature, whatever may be said of their <hi rend="ital"
            >justness</hi>, are not <hi rend="ital">general</hi>, unless we admit, what I suspect to be the case, that nature in a village is very
          much like nature every where else. It will be observed that all my pictures are from humble life, and most of my heroines servant maids.
          Such I would have them: being fully persuaded that, in no other way would my endeavours, either to please or to instruct, have an equal
          chance of success.</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The path I have thus taken, from necessity, as well as from choice, is well understood and approved by hundreds, who are
          capable of ranging in the higher walks of literature.—But with due deference to their superior claim, I confess, that no recompense has been
          half so grateful or half so agreeable to me as female approbation. To be readily and generally understood, to have my simple Tales almost
          instinctively relished by those who have so decided an influence over the lives, hearts, and manners of us all, is the utmost stretch of my
          ambition.</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I here venture, before the public eye, a selection from the various pieces which have been the source of much pleasure, and
          the solace of my leisure hours during the last four years, and since the publication of the ‘Rural Tales.’ Perhaps, in some of them, more of
          mirth is intermingled than many who know me would expect, or than the severe will be inclined to approve. But surely what I can say, or can
          be expected to say, on subjects of country life, would gain little by the seriousness of a preacher, or by exhibiting fallacious
          representations of what has long been termed <hi rend="ital">Rural Innocence</hi>.</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The Poem of ‘Good Tidings’ is partially known to the world, but, as it was originally intended to assume its present
          appearance and size, I have gladly availed myself of an endeavour to improve it; and, from its present extended circulation, I trust it will
          be new to thousands.</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">I anticipate some approbation from such readers as have been pleased with the ‘Rural Tales;’ yet, though I will not falsify
          my own feelings by assuming a diffidence which I do not conceive to be either manly or becoming, the conviction that some reputation is
          hazarded in ‘a third attempt,’ is impressed deeply on my mind.</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">With such sentiments, and with a lively sense of the high honour, and a hope of the bright recompence, of applause from the
          good, when heightened by the self-approving voice of my own conscience, I commit the book to its fate.</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#right">ROBERT BLOOMFIELD.</p>
