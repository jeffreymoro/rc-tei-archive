            <p class="noCount">HON. FATHER,</p>
            <p class="noCount">It would have been a great pleasure to us both to have met you at Mr. Wyatt’s this
               time, and we were only prevented by visitors, who came quite unexpected. You would
               have liked to have seen our little one; and I hope you will yet, before long. We thank
               you for all your kindness, and as I am endeavouring to get into business for myself,
               I sincerely hope, to have it in my power, to entertain you better when you come. I
               have an undeniable chance. I have some good customers, and might have enough immediately,
               to provide a genteel living for <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BloomfieldMaryAnn">my wife</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BloomfieldHannah">child</a>, if I could take advantage of it soon. If I could get three months credit at my leather-cutters,
               for five or six pounds only, it would enable me to give credit to that amount, as
               my custom lies among such, as are able and willing to improve it: but I am determined
               to carry it on as well as I can.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The underwritten lines, contain the sentiments, which always occur to my mind when
               I come to Woolwich; and as I put them into metre when the Boyne was launched, and
               they are still perfect on my mind, I write them now, because I think you have a relish
               for such things, particularly the devotional parts of them.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Before I was married, I often amused myself with such compositions, and had several
               pieces published in newspapers, magazines, &amp;; but I find other employment now, which
               is of equal pleasure to me.</p>
            <p class="noCount">My Polly and the child are in good health, and I hope to hear from you soon; and remain
               yours, in duty and affection, </p>
