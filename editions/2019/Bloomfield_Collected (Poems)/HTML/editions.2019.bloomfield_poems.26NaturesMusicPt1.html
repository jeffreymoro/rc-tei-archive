            <p class="noCount">Introduction</p>
            <p class="noCount">Bloomfield’s interest in music was of longstanding: he had, before marrying, been
               a fiddle player and he continued to write verse for composers to set. Many of his
               songs were arranged for piano and harp. It was not until 1806, however, that Bloomfield
               took up, as a trade, the manufacture of Aeolian harps, telling his friend <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#InskipThomas">Thomas Inskip</a> that ‘I find such pleasure in the use of the saw and the plane that I am determined
               to … attack the Harps tomorrow’ (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.189.html">Letter 189</a>; 27 June 1806). He gave harps to his genteel friends and sold them to their friends:
               <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#ParkThomas">Thomas Park</a>, the editor, and his wife Maria Hester, were amongst the earliest to receive an instrument.
               Mrs Park then published a sonnet in thanks. Her ‘Addressed to an Eolian Harp, constructed
               by the Author of “The Farmer’s Boy”, “Wild Flowers”, &amp;c.’ was published in <em>The Monthly Mirror</em> (21 (1806), 196):

               <div class="noCount">What magic sweetness charms my raptur’d ear,</div>
               <div class="noCount">Like choirs of airy spirits heard on high?—</div>
               <div class="noCount">Now as some cherub-voice each note is clear,</div>
               <div class="noCount">Now swells into celestial harmony!—</div>
               <div class="noCount">‘Tis charmed zephyr makes the varied sound,</div>
               <div class="noCount">As on each string he breathes a trembling kiss;</div>
               <div class="noCount">His viewless pinion wafts the music round,</div>
               <div class="noCount">Whose swell is ecstasy, whose close is bliss!</div>
               <div class="noCount">Oh sweetly raise thy more than mortal tone</div>
               <div class="noCount">To <span class="ital">him</span> who gave thy frame melodious birth,
               </div>
               <div class="noCount">The bard whom Nature greets as all her own,</div>
               <div class="noCount">And Virtue honours for his inborn worth,</div>
               <div class="noCount">For him, sweet harp! Thy dulcet strains prolong,</div>
               <div class="noCount">Since pure and artless is, like thine, his song.</div>
            </div>
            <p class="noCount">The sonnet claimed the attention of <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LofftCapel">Capel Lofft</a>, who wrote alerting Bloomfield to James Thomson’s poetic tributes to the instrument,
               ‘the charming lines in the “Castle of Indolence”,’ and ‘his exquisite “Ode to the
               Aeolian Harp”‘ (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.188.html">Letter 188</a>; June 1806). Thus edified, Bloomfield was able, in other letters, to make the instrument’s
               poetic heritage part of the package that would recommend it to his patrons and customers.
               Writing to the <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BuchanLord">Earl of Buchan</a> on 15 September 1806 (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.191.html">Letter 191</a>) he declared
            </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">I cannot conclude without informing your Lordship, whom I know to be possessd of a
               love for nature’s music, and a fund of fancys, that I have lately taken up a new and
               most agreeable trade, that of constructing Eolian Harps. I am become rather dextrous
               in the use of the plane and the glue-pot, and find a demand that I am hardly able
               to satisfy. Can any thing in Nature, or even in imagination, exceed the tone of that
               simple instrument? Your unrivalled Thompson knew it well. Witness his Castle of Indolence,
               the finest lines that can possibly be written on the subject. 
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="noCount">Ah me, what hand can touch the strings so fine?</div>
                  <div class="noCount">Who up the lofty diapason roll</div>
                  <div class="noCount">Such sweet, such sad, such solemn airs divine</div>
                  <div class="noCount">Then let them down again into the soul?</div>
               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="noCount">From letters such as these came the idea of printing an anthology of writings on the
               Aeolian Harp to give out, with the harps he constructed. He told <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LloydBakerMary">Mary Lloyd Baker</a> on 14 March 1807 (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.203.html">Letter 203</a>)
            </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">your idea of my being in the road to <span class="ital">publish</span> what I can gather as to the nature of the Harp, is wrong. I only thought of printing
               a few copies for private distribution to such of my customers as profess’d to know
               nothing on the subject, and just to make it pay its own expence, and stand as a profess’d
               compilation on that particular themes. It would save me much talking, and that to
               me is a material thing.

            <p class="noCount">By the winter of 1807 ill-health and delays at the engraver had left Bloomfield seriously
               in arrears with his harp orders, and although the manuscript was printed by his friend
               <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#SwanJames">James Swan</a> in 1808 for distribution with each harp sold, production began to languish. It picked
               up in December 1808, when Bloomfield’s musical brother <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother">Isaac</a> came to stay in London. ‘We are making Harps by the dozen’, Bloomfield recorded (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.234.html">Letter 234</a>). This flurry of manufacture did not last, however, as Bloomfield succumbed to migraines,
               eye problems and rheumatism, and became plagued by poverty. His last mention of building
               harps comes in a letter of 1811. <em>Nature’s Music</em> also languished until in 1822, Bloomfield, by now in dire financial straits, wondered
               whether it might be reprinted, and perhaps form a means of raising money through subscription
               (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.365.html">Letter 365</a>). This did not occur.
