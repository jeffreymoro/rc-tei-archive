            <p class="noCount">Bloomfield’s second children’s book, written jointly with his son <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon">Charles</a> who was training to be schoolmaster in London and Kent, was in progress by autumn
               1822. On 28 October (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.364.html">Letter 364</a>), Bloomfield advised his son ‘do not fail to send me whatever you may have written,
               I mean <span class="ital">all</span> that you have written about the “Birds and Insects” that I may shew Mr Harvey a specimen
               of the work at Christmas if possible . . . I do what I can at it’. Harvey was the
               bookseller who specialised in children’s literature and who had published <em>The History of Little Davy’s New Hat. </em>Bloomfield, however, was sick and depressed, and in a sad letter begun on 23 December
               1822 but not finished until 1 February 1823 (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.366.html">Letter 366</a>) confesses he has not yet sent the manuscript to Harvey. On 2 May 1823 he told Charles
               that ‘I have written more letters for our “post Office”and think it will do well considered
               as a minor concern in our persuits’ (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.369.html">Letter 369</a>), but it remained unpublished at his death in August: no deal with Darton and Harvey
               was done. The work appeared in 1824 in <em>The Remains of Robert Bloomfield</em>, edited by Bloomfield’s friend Joseph Weston and published for the benefit of Bloomfield’s
               family by Baldwin, Cradock and Joy.

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p><em>The Birds’ and Insects’ Post Office </em>is a delightful text book for children, teaching natural history and moral conduct
                  by using the charming conceit of having birds and insects write letters to each other:
                  exactly the kind of gentle humour at which Bloomfield excels. As Bridget Keegan has
                  shown, it follows in a tradition dating back to Aesop but more recently revived by
                  the children’s writers whom he credited in the Preface to <em>Little Davy</em>—Anna Laetitia Barbauld and Sarah Trimmer among them: ‘Bloomfield’s prefatory remarks
                  are comparable to those of many Romantic-period children’s writers, such as Sarah
                  Trimmer, who writes in the introduction to her The History of Robins (first published
                  as <em>Fabulous Histories</em> in 1786) that it should be taken “not as containing the real conversation of birds,
                  (for that is impossible we should ever understand) but as a series of fables intended
                  to convey moral instructions applicable to themselves”’.

                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>‘Bloomfield’s Writing for Children’, in Robert Bloomfield: The Inestimable Blessing
                           of Letters, Romantic Circles Praxis.</span></div>
                  </div> Bloomfield’s text, it should be noted, is full of detailed observation of fauna in
                  its habitat: it is for that reason less ostensible in its moral didacticism than Trimmer’s
                  work.
