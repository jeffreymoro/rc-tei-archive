            <p class="noCount">Bloomfield’s poems were reprinted many times throughout the nineteenth century. The
               1809 stereotype edition (reprinted 1817) of Bloomfield’s first three collections is
               the most important of these, since he had editorial control over it. Post-1900 editions
               are far fewer, and those we are aware of are listed here in chronological order (not
               including recent generic print-on-demand reprints).

               <!--anchor--></a><p class="noCount">A Note on the Text</p>
            <p class="noCount">The copytext for the works in this, the first ever edition of Bloomfield’s collected
               writings, is that of first publication, collated with later lifetime editions and
               the 1824 <em>Remains of Robert Bloomfield</em>. Spelling and punctuation have been retained from the first publication. Verbal variants
               have been recorded; variants of spelling and punctuation have not. One wholesale change
               has been made: the eighteenth-century practice of beginning each line of a quotation
               with an inverted comma has not been retained.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">In the case of the major work, <em>The Farmer’s Boy</em>, we have collated the two extant MSS – the 1798 MS of the poem sent by Bloomfield
               to his patron Capel Lofft and, emended by Lofft, sent thence to Thomas Hill and to
               the printer (Houghton Library fMS Eng 776); also that of the poem as reconstructed
               from memory by Bloomfield in 1801, so as to preserve (in effect reconstitute) a version
               of the text as he first wrote it, free of Lofft’s alterations (Houghton Library fMS
               Eng 776.1). This constitutes the first ever variorum text of the poem, tracing all
               the manifold alterations in the lifetime editions, not least the changes in the Preface
               that reflected a battle for control of the text between Lofft, Bloomfield and the
               publishers Vernor and Hood.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">A similar battle is preserved in the variants we record across the editions of <em>Rural Tales</em>. Here, for the first time, we make it possible to trace the imposition by Lofft of
               critical remarks on each poem in the volume’s first printing and their subsequent
               removal; the reviewers’ derision endorsed Bloomfield’s prophecy that such comments
               would attract ridicule.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">Minor poems first collected after Bloomfield’s death in <em>The Remains of Robert Bloomfield</em> are presented in chronological order of composition and publication, where the date
               has been determined. Where we have been unable to establish the date of writing and/or
               publication, we have presented the poems in a section ‘Poems Published in <em>The Remains of Robert Bloomfield</em>’.
