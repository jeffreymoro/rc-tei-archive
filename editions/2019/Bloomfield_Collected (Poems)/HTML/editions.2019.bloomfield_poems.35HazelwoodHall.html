            <p class="noCount">Bloomfield’s only play, <em>Hazelwood-Hall</em> (1823), the last new work published in his lifetime, was never staged. Finished only
               a few months before, and published in the month of, Bloomfield’s death (August) by
               <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BaldwinRobert">Baldwin</a>, Cradock and Joy, it appeared in a smaller edition than his previous works (750 in
               duodecimo, priced 3 shillings). It was reviewed badly and sold so poorly that, writing
               to <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BloomfieldHannah">Bloomfield’s daughter</a> after his death, the publishers were unwilling to put any value on the copyright,
               of which Bloomfield had sold them a half share (see <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.369.html">Letter 369</a>, 2 May 1823 and <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.373.html">Letter 373</a>, 1 October 1823).
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">The drama was clearly a product of the same years of poverty, illness and anxiety
               as <em>May-Day with the Muses</em>, for it too conjured up a village in which the vulnerability of the labouring classes
               to exploitation—sexual and social—is a spectre summoned only to be banished by collective
               action by the poor. Thus, Mary, a poor, innocent village girl is the target of the
               seducer Jack Whirlwind, a visiting rake who represents fast, fashionable, urban values.
               Whirlwind is defeated as he tries to abduct Mary in his latest-model carriage: Joel
               Spokeum, the reliable, honest village wheelwright cudgels him. In the end, a proper
               marriage is made, a legacy having been discovered, presided over by Squire Morrison.
               In effect, the villagers are enabled to enforce traditional standards of behaviour
               (a moral economy) because the community is protected by a benevolent, paternalist
               squire of the old school, rather than an ‘improving’ agriculturalist who encloses
               the land or a profligate absentee landlord. By 1823, the public had encountered this
               scenario many times before in Bloomfield’s work, and to many it now seemed quaintly
               nostalgic, out of touch with both social conditions on the ground and with the increasingly
               cosmopolitan tastes of the educated classes. It was limited, too, by Bloomfield’s
               inexperience as a dramatist: the plot is hackneyed, depending upon unconvincing reversals
               of fortune; the characters are flat, lacking individual ways of speaking; there is
               little on-stage action. <em>The British Magazine </em>(1 (1823), 210–12) was blunt: ‘it is more like a Sunday-school tract in dialogue than
               a drama … at the best, puerile: there is nothing in it to deserve criticism’. <em>Gentleman’s Magazine </em>(93, part 2 (1823), 499), writing after Bloomfield’s death, was politer, but concurred:
               it ‘has nothing but simplicity and the name of <span class="ital">Bloomfield</span> to recommend it’ it declared, lamenting the fact that Bloomfield’s last publication
               should have been his weakest.
            </p><br/><br/><p class="noCount">ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="smcaps">This</span> little dramatic sketch is not so new as it may appear to be. So long ago as the year
               1805, a gentleman met me on the sands at Worthing, and asked me to his house, &amp;c.
               but I never saw him afterwards. He gave his address, ‘Mr. Goldhawk, Hazelwood-Hall,
               Leith-Hill, Surrey.’ The names never left my mind, and I then thought of trying them
               in a village tale, or drama, which I actually began. The subject has slept ever since,
               until the publication of my ‘May Day,’ last spring, left me leisure and inclination
               to put it into its present form. I make no pretensions to a knowledge of the ‘dramatic
               unities,’ or of what is called ‘stage effect.’ It may be like twenty plays, which
               I have never seen. The characters are exclusively villagers, with the exception of
               <span class="ital">Jack Whirlwind</span>; through whom I have endeavoured to censure the horrible vice of seducing unguarded
               females, and then leaving them to scorn and misery.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">If the more fastidious reader should by chance lay his hand on this trifle, and should
               object to the very name of play, or drama, such reader is assured that he will not
               find in it either an oath, a pun, or an innuendo. Whatever may be its fate, even if
               it should ultimately get upon the stage, and be subjected to what may be thought the
               necessary bolsters, stays, and clippings, and these should be actual improvements,
               I shall have nothing to do with them. It is very natural that, thus situated, I should
               wish to be answerable for nothing but what I here print: and I remain the reader’s

            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Spok. </span>Whatever I am doing, Joel, I am not in love; but I have observed, that since you have
               been acquainted with your Mary, up at the Hall, you are always singing or sighing,
               reading or scribbling: you are quite an altered young man.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Joel. </span>I hope you don’t think me altered for the worse, father. If you do, I can’t tell when

            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Spok. </span>But could not you love her as other people love, that is, <span class="ital">reasonably</span>? for there is ‘reason in roasting of eggs,’ as my father used to say. But you will

            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Joel. </span>Nay, don’t say so, father. I remember the time when I pleased you long ago, by taking
               your advice. Don’t you recollect when all the boys in the parish planned how to rob
               Lady Hazelwood’s orchard, and I would not go? And don’t you remember you gave me a
               shilling—a whole shilling for myself, because I refused?

            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Spok. </span>Yes, I recollect it; that was well done: but I don’t ask you to forsake Mary Maythorn.

               this part of England, I assure you.

               mansion there, that’s a comfort to a man of my quiet habits; for I have done roving:
               I have seen enough of the world, and wish for peace here beside the forest, where
               I can walk without being jostled.

               most of the two: plenty of birds, captain, plenty of birds.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Gold.</span> Oh! plenty of birds, out-door birds, and indoor birds; and sometimes it happens that
               one single bird is pursued with more pleasure than all the rest.

               of my sort of fellows at last; but I have seen young men as sensible to the charms

               and have been talking to the boldest of the deer, that always meet me there: I have
               one little doe, which I have made as tame as a pet lamb. I cannot think how you men
               can be so barbarous as to molest and injure such beautiful animals!

               why I should be terrified in aiming at a bird, for fear of shooting my own grandfather.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Gold. </span>I once shot a tiger; but I had no tender lady by my side, either to applaud or rebuke

            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Emma. </span>O dear, captain, pray don’t call it a rebuke; I meant no harm, indeed I did not: but
               if rebuke it was, it would be perfectly useless; for field-sports to a country gentleman
               form an essential part of his existence; he would feel and look as ridiculous without
               a gun as without a hat.

               like it, and she says she could not stir out of doors without a protector; and I have

            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Emma. </span>There now was a fine burst of natural feeling, spoilt by the introduction of what
               you call <span class="ital">classical knowledge</span>, which boys learn at school—old heathenish nonsense. Such tales were not invented
               or written for people of this country—I am glad to see you, however.

            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Lady H. </span>No, child—but I sat at home till my thoughts grew too powerful for me, not on your

            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Mor. </span>Then you have taken the wisest way in the world to give them a contrary turn, for
               ‘there is a spirit in the woods.’ I have been telling Emma so, but she would not hear
               a word about the matter.

            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Emma. </span>That was because you called <span class="ital">me </span>the spirit of the woods. I know there is an intensity of feeling—a kind of awe, in
               such a scene, which is indescribable, and, therefore, I will not attempt it.

               In plain English then, all the oaks you see in that direction, for a compass of three
               miles, call me master; and you shall hear them acknowledge it—a little this way, ladies.

               my father’s name —the name could not be found. I then looked for Duck Bottom, which
               is the name of the place—I could not find that. I then found out that the names were

               I am afraid he is too great a fool for anything.

            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Spok. </span>O sir, very little, sir; but it came out in a minute—it came of itself. Says I, that
               machine has been invented long before we were born, and I have only to take pattern
               by one that has stood up on our common for these forty years; it only consists of
               two strong upright posts, with a cross bar at the top—you understand me, gentlemen.

               the lawyer. I think I was ‘down upon him’ there, as my father used to say.—Knock your
               foes down one at a time, that’s the way to settle them.

            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Spok. </span>Sir, I defy them to make me angry, unless they speak slightingly of my son Joel; that
               I can’t bear at all! Why, gentlemen, my son Joel and I, and your honours, are the
               cleverest men in these two parishes.

            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Betty. </span>Now, there lies the misfortune; for master don’t believe in witchcraft, and so I must
               lose my place. But, madam, as I passed old Nan Barret yesterday, with my new bonnet
               on, she gave me such an evil look, as would have spoiled all the cream in the county.
               I was sure that mischief would follow. A spiteful old creature! she looks as though
               she had never been young; and I am sure she never could have been handsome, for all
               the children in the parish are afraid of her.—Do pray speak for me, madam; for I never

               looking for pins, and gloves, and pattens, and shall lose the beautiful sunshine,
               and be just ready when the rain pours down—I won’t be out of patience, if I can possibly

            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Joel. </span>No; there I defy them! Distress shall never come whilst I have a pair of arms to chop
               out a cart wheel.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Mary. </span>You strange man—will you hear me? You mistake me still. Must I speak plainer? Well,
               then will you go with me into the house, and face them all, and show yourself a man?
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Joel. </span>Yes!—What else?
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Mary. </span>My father—(Oh! that I should ever live to say that word)—my father is very kind and
               considerate, and holds you in high esteem: all may be right yet—Will you go?
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Joel. </span>Will I go at your bidding? Yes, to the world’s end, barefoot!—Will I go? Ay, if all
               Captain Goldhawk’s serpents and tigers should guard the door,—see if I won’t!

            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Gold. </span>Now, Morrison, that I have found a child, I have something to live for; and when the
               fine autumnal weather is propitious, I’ll have a tent fixed in the forest, and we’ll
               all be merry as gipsies.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Emma. </span>Ay, and in the spring too, captain; for that is my season of delight.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Mor. </span>Ay, and of mine, my dearest; and you shall dance amongst the cowslips with our happy-hearted
               Mary.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Gold. </span>And so, Lady Hazelwood, she has been a good girl, and sensible of all your kindness?
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Lady H. </span>Indeed she possesses virtuous feelings and unbounded affection—and what more can he
               said of a woman?—Here she comes.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Enter </span><span class="smcaps">Mary</span> <span class="ital">and </span><span class="smcaps">Joel</span>.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Gold. </span>And so, my little comforter, you ran away from me as soon as you had found me?
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Mary. </span>Indeed, sir, I felt as though I had two hearts, and I did not know which to obey first.
               Pray forgive this rudeness; I am sure you will love me the better for it.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Gold. </span>O, it’s all forgiven.—‘Two hearts,’ did you say? Then I’ll contrive you shall obey
               them both in a short time; and we will have such charming evenings, and I’ll tell
               you all my old stories about my voyage round the Cape, and all the dreadful lightnings
               of the Indian Ocean, and all about the tigers of Java!
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Mary. </span>O! sir, you really terrify me with the bare thought of the tigers.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Gold. </span>Poh! it’s all nonsense, child: why a tiger is nothing more than a great overgrown
               cat, that don’t like to be coaxed when he is wild.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Mor. </span>Joel, you are a lucky fellow! I’ll engage that the way is all clear before you—you
               are a happy man!
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Joel (bowing). </span>Sir, may I humbly return the compliment?—for the Lady Emma is—
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Emma. </span>Hush! here is more company coming.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Enter </span><span class="smcaps">Spokeum</span> <span class="ital">and </span><span class="smcaps">Judith</span>.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Judith. </span>O, my lady! Spokeum has dragged me along so fast, that I can hardly say how glad I
               am to see this happy hour—and Miss Emma here and all!
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Emma. </span>Judie, you ought to be proud of having performed your duty so well: cheer up, and
               we shall be all friends together.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Gold. </span>Come, come, I see I can put an end to all this; not by the word of command, but a
               word of entreaty.—Lady Hazelwood, think of my friend Morrison, and give him your stag-hunting
               and heathen-loving daughter; and I will follow your example—join their hands.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Lady H. </span>There, captain, I have done it. This is the happiest hour of my life !—May Heaven’s
               blessing fall upon your heads!
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Gold. </span>Joel, my honest lad, come hither; you shall marry my daughter, as sure as a gun: and
               you, faithful old Judith, shall have fifty pounds a year as long as you live.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Joel. </span>There, old lassy, there!—What do you think of me now?—Come out and help me to jump—come
               out, I say <span class="ital">(seizing both her hands).</span></p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Judith. </span>Consider my corns—oh, my corns, Joel; you know I can’t jump:—don’t make yourself quite
               a fool, boy—don’t.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Joel. </span>Why, bless your old heart, you look almost as young and as handsome as Mary!
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">(Kissing her violently).</span></p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Spok. </span>And so here have been <span class="ital">two </span>women keeping a secret for years together!—Was ever such a thing heard of?
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Emma. </span>You must not be too much astonished, Spokeum—but you may say <span class="ital">three </span>women; for I have known it ever since the captain came home.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Spok. </span>What, <span class="ital">three </span>women kept a secret! why this is more surprising still! it is more wonderful than
               picking hops by machinery!
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Mor. </span>You must be calm, old neighbour, since it is all in your favour.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Spok. </span>Well, sir, begging your honour’s pardon, I am as calm as ever I was in my life—but,
               Judie, I say, old woman, how is this that you never dropped a word of this affair
               to me?
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Judith. </span>It was because I know you; for when you have a little drop of drink in your head (and
               a very little will do it), you are apt to blab out everything that you know.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Spok. </span>Humph! mayhap you will say that I have got drink in my head now; but I declare that
               I have had but two horns of ale since I came into the house—(it was plaguey strong
               though); and I don’t care what you say—go on—I tell you I don’t care.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Judith. </span>Ay, <span class="ital">don’t care, </span>that’s always your word when you are a little vexed; but I know you of old.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Spok. </span>Well, I tell you again, then, I don’t care.— Hang me if I care, at this minute, for
               any man in all the whole globe of England!—there, now.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Emma. </span>Why, Spokeum, don’t suffer yourself to be angry; we are all met here to be happy.—Is
               it not so, mamma?
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Lady H. </span>Yes, certainly, child, and who would interrupt it?
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Spok. </span>Not I, my lady. I’ll warrant I’ll be as merry as my betters, for who is to mind what
               that old woman is squeaking about?—I don’t care a farthing for her.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Emma. </span>O, Morrison, John and Betty are coming.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Mor. </span>So much the better, my life. I guess their errand; it will soon be over.

               was the next, Betty?
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Betty. </span>O, don’t ask me; I have forgot every word of it, I’m sure.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Gos. </span>An’ please your honour, I had made a little speech on purpose, but in coming along
               we have both forgot it. However the long and the short of the story is this—I thank
               your honour for the restoration of Duck-Bottom—(ay, ‘restoration,’ that was one of
               the words, I am sure).
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Mor. </span>O, say no more, John; you are perfectly welcome to all the services I can render you
               at any time.
            </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Betty.</span> And, sir, an’ please your honour; and now my husband (that is to be) is a freeholder
               <span class="ital">(curtsying), </span>and sure as I shall be called Mistress Gosling, I promise never to set a pail in his

            <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">Gold. </span>Come, come, Morrison, have done with all that, and look after your fiddlers: what
