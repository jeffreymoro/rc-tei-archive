               it came to their hands under no circumstances of adventitious recommendation. With
               some a person must be rich, or titled, or fashionable as a literary name, or at least
               fashionable in some respect, good or bad, before any thing which he can offer will
               be thought worthy of notice.

         <p class="noCount">I had been a little accustomed to the effect of prejudices: and I was determined to

            <p>At first I confess, seeing it divided into the four Seasons, I had to encounter a
               prepossession not very advantageous to any writer, that the Author was treading in

                        to turn the whole Poem into rhyme: but that there have been many imitations of it

               Verse into Rhime;…from its own pure native Gold into an alloyed Metal of incomparably
               less splendor, permanence, and worth.
            </p>
         </div>
         <p class="noCount">I had soon, however, the pleasure of finding myself relieved from that apprehension:
            and of discovering that, although the delineation of <span class="smcaps">Rural Scenery</span> naturally branches itself into these divisions, there was little else except the
            General Qualities of a musical ear; flowing numbers, Feeling, Piety, poetic Imagery
            and Animation, a taste for the picturesque, a true sense of the natural and pathetic,
            force of thought, and liveliness of imagination, which were in common between Thomson
            and this Author. And these are qualities which whoever has the eye, the heart, the
            awakened and surrounding intellect, and the diviner sense of the Poet; which alone
            can deserve the name, must possess.

               are so widely diverse in the two Authors, could make it different. Simplicity, sweetness,

            as given me by his Brother:… a Man to whom also I was entirely a stranger:… but whose
            Candor, good Sense, and brotherly Affection, appear in this Narrative; and of the

            in consequence of a correspondence with him on different occasions which have since

With that design various Engagements have since greatly interfer’d. From one of
               the most laborious and constant of those, that of the office of a Justice of the Peace
               for the County of Suffolk, I am now discharg’d. Why those who are in power have done
               this, they have not explain’d: and it being an office from which any one who holds
               it is removable at <span class="ital">pleasure</span>, they are not call’d to explain. Had it been for Crime or Misconduct as a Magistrate,
               of course Trial and Conviction should have preceded my Removal. As it is, I feel,
               as I have publicly declar’d, no shame in the removal. I have held an office honorable
               because extensively useful; because unprofitable and burthensome to the individual;
               because independently and conscientiously exercis’d, with a devotion, such as it requir’d,
               of my time, my thoughts, and my best faculties, daily to its discharge. My Colleagues,—and
               they are and have been, during a course of seventeen years, those of them who now
               act, and those who are dead or absent, men with whom to have acted was indeed satisfactory
               and pleasant,—my late Colleagues part with me, and I with them regrettingly. Our reciprocal
               Esteem is not lessen’d by this abruption of our official intercourse. And as every
               man who feels what Society is, ought to determine to be serviceable to the Public,
               my removal from this office neither weakens the determination, nor probably will be
               found to have impair’d the means of effecting it. I am therefore well content;—as
               I ought to be. I sought not the office. I have never sought any. It solicited my acceptance;
               unask’d and unexpected. I owe my appointment to the <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3">Duke of <span class="smcaps">Grafton</span></a>, very soon after I came to reside in this County. He was then <span class="ital">Lord Lieutenant</span>. I have not yielded that appointment to disgust; though there were those who were
               not sparing in their endeavours to disgust me with it: I have not relinquish’d it
               to suit my convenience; though in times like these an office of no little expence,
               and which shut me out from sources of professional emolument, was to me certainly
               not convenient: I have not consulted my ease or health by a voluntary retirement.
               I am remov’d, I am superseded, I am struck out from an office of incredible and hourly
               increasing anxiety. Circumstances like this are not new. They have repeatedly taken
               place in relation to very high offices; and the Public remembers men to whom they
               have happen’d whose internal dignity and worth is above any official dignity. Had
               I felt that I <span class="ital">merited</span> to be remov’d, I should not have thought myself a fit Editor of the <span class="smcaps">Farmer’s Boy</span>; a Poem which breathes every where modest independence, benevolence, innocence, and
               virtue. As it is, I think myself no way less fit than ever for any laudable and becoming
               employ. And I have accordingly announc’d my intention of resuming my profession as
               a <span class="smcaps">Barrister</span>.

            a Production to propose to public Attention how could they be unsuccessful?) ‘in rescuing
            from oblivion a Poem, which for the harmony of its numbers, the beauty of its imagery,
            originality of thought, elegance and chasteness of diction, (every circumstance consider’d,)
            stands unrivall’d in the Annals of English Literature, and will descend to Posterity

            purpose I obtain’d his address, and found him … the modest, the unambitious person
            you describe; wondering at the praise and admiration with which his Poem has been
            receiv’d; whose utmost ambition was to have presented a fair copy to his aged Mother,
            as a pledge of filial affection, and a picture of his juvenile avocations. So unexpected
            was the fame of his production, that the whole of his good fortune appears to him
            as a dream.—“I had no more idea,” says he, “to be sent for by the Duke of Grafton,
            and be so kindly and generously treated, than of the hour I shall die.”

            it in a garret, amid the bustle and noise of six or seven fellow workmen, whether
            he us’d a slate; or wrote it on paper with a pencil, or pen and ink. But what was
            my surprize when told that he had us’d neither.—My business, during the greatest part
            of my life having led me into the line of litterary pursuits, and made me acquainted
            with litterary men, I am, consequently, pretty well inform’d of the methods us’d by
            authors for the retention of their productions. We are told, if my recollection is
            just, that Milton took his Daughters as his amanuenses; that Savage, when his poverty
            precluded him the conveniency of pen, ink, and paper, us’d to study in the streets,
            and go into shops to record the productions of his fertile genius; that Pope, when
            on visits at Lord Bolingbroke’s, us’d to ring up the servants at any hour in the night
            for pen and ink, to write any thought that struck his lively and wakeful imagination;
            that Dr. Blacklock, though blind, had the happy faculty of writing down, in a very
            legible hand, the chaste and elegant productions of his Muse.

         <p class="noCount">But this is not all.—He went still a step farther.—He not only compos’d and committed

            of Mr. <span class="smcaps">Bloomfield</span>) ‘let us now turn our attention to the species of composition of which his Poem is
            so perfect a specimen. It has been observ’d in my sixteenth number that <span class="smcaps">Pastoral Poetry</span> in this country, with very few exceptions, has exhibited a tame and servile adherence
            to classical imagery and costume; at the same time totally overlooking that profusion
            of picturesque beauty, and that originality of manner and peculiarity of employment,
            which our climate and our rustics every where present.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">A few Authors were mention’d in that Essay as having judiciously deviated from the
            customary plan: to these may now be added the name of <span class="ital">Bloomfield</span>, the <span class="ital">Farmer’s Boy</span>, though not assuming the form of an Eclogue, being peculiarly and exclusively, throughout
            a <span class="ital">pastoral Composition</span>; not like the Poem of <span class="ital">Thomson</span>, taking a wide excursion through all the phaenomena of the <span class="ital">Seasons</span>, but merely limited to the rural <span class="ital">occupation</span> and business of the fields, the dairy, and the farm yard.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">As with these employments, however, the vicissitudes of the Year are immediately and
            necessarily connected, Mr. Bloomfield has, with propriety, divided his Poem into <span class="ital">Four </span>Books, affixing to those Books the Titles of the Seasons.

            picture of a green and woody covert with all its insect tribe. The ascension of the
            sky-lark, the peaceful repose of <span class="ital">Giles</span>, a view of the ripening harvest, with some moral reflections on Nature and her great
            Creator, are introduced: followed by animated descriptions of reaping, gleaning, the
            honest exultation of the Farmer, the beauty of the Country Girl, and the wholesome
            refreshment of the field. Animals teazed by insects, the cruelty of docking horses,
            the insolence of the gander, the apathy of the swine, are drawn in a striking manner:
            and the Book concludes with masterly pictures of a twilight repose, a midnight storm
            of thunder and lightning, and views of the ancient and present mode of celebrating
            Harvest-home.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">The <span class="ital">third</span> Book, <span class="ital">Autumn</span>, is introduc’d with a delineation of forest scenery, and pigs fattening on fallen
            acorns. Sketches of wild ducks and their haunts, of hogs settling to repose in a wood,
            and of wheat sowing, succeed. The sound of village bells suggests a most pleasing
            digression: of which the church and its pastor, the rustic amusements of a Sunday,
            the Village Maids, and a most pathetic description of a distracted Female, are the
            prominent features. Returning to rural business, <span class="ital">Giles</span> is drawn guarding the rising wheat from birds:—his little hut, with his preparation
            for the reception of his playmates, their treachery and his disappointment, are conceiv’d
            and colour’d in an exquisite style. Fox-Hunting, the Fox-hound’s epitaph, the long
            autumnal evenings, a description of domestic fowl, and a welcome to the snowy nights
            of Winter, form the concluding topics of this Season.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">The <span class="ital">fourth</span> Book, under the appellation of <span class="ital">Winter</span>, is usher’d in by some humane injunctions for the treatment of storm-pinch’d cattle.
            The frozen turnips are broken for them: and the cowyard at night is describ’d. The
            conviviality of a Christmas evening, and the conversation round the fire, with the
            admonitions from the Master’s chair, are depicted in a manner truly pleasing. The
            <span class="ital">Sea Boy</span> and the <span class="ital">Farmer’s Boy</span> are contrasted with much effect:—and the ploughman feeding his horses at night, with
            the comparison between the cart-horse and post-horse, have great merit. The mastiff
            turn’d sheep-biter is next delineated; succeeded by a description of a moon-light
            night, and the appearance of a spectre.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">The counting of the Sheep in the fold, and the adopted Lambs, are beautiful paintings:
            and with the Triumph of <span class="smcaps">Giles</span> on the conclusion of the Year, and his Address to the <span class="smcaps">Deity</span>, the Book and Poem close.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">Such are the Materials of which THE FARMER’S BOY is constructed. Several of the topics,
            it will be perceiv’d are new to Poetry; and of those which are in their <span class="ital">title</span> familiar to the readers of our descriptive Bards, it will be found that the imagery
            and adjunctive circumstances are original, and the effort of a mind practis’d in the
            rare art of selecting and combining the most striking and picturesque features of
            an object.’
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">Dr. Drake after this well accounts for the poetic singularity that the Poetry of <span class="ital">Thomson </span>should have past through a mind so enthusiastically enamor’d of it, without impairing
            the originality of its character, when exercis’d on a subject so much leading to imitation.
            This he explains, and justly, by the vivid impressions on a most sensible and powerful
            imagination in his earliest youth, anterior to the study of any Poet.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">Dr. <span class="smcaps">Drake</span> expresses his astonishment at the <span class="smcaps">Versification</span> and <span class="smcaps">Diction</span> of this Poem. And says most truly, ‘I am well aware that smooth and flowing lines
            are of easy purchase, and the property of almost every poetaster of the day: but the
            versification of Mr. <span class="ital">Bloomfield</span> is of another character; it displays beauties of the most positive kind, and those

               of litterature. It displays occasionally likewise a vigour and a brilliancy of polish

         <p class="noCount">Dr. <span class="smcaps">Drake</span> confirms, by copious and very judicious <span class="ital">Extracts </span>from the various parts of the Poem, as they offer themselves to critical selection,
            in accompanying the Farmer’s Boy through the Circle of his year, the Judgment which
            he has form’d with so much ability, taste, and feeling, and has so agreeably express’d,
            of the Merits of our <span class="smcaps">English Georgic</span>. And he speaks in his <span class="ital">third </span>and last Essay on it thus:
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">‘From the review we have now taken of <span class="smcaps">The Farmer’s Boy</span>, it will be evident, I think, that owing to its harmony and sweetness of versification,
            its benevolence of sentiment, and originality of imagery, it is entitled to rank very
            high in the class of descriptive and <span class="ital">pastoral </span>Poetry.’
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">He concludes with an highly animated and feeling anticipation of that public attention
            to the Poem and to its Author, merited in every view, and which already has manifested
            itself in such an extent.

            be expected from what has been said, are extremely few indeed. And almost all that

               to the disadvantage of Mr. Bloomfield, that his learned friend and Editor was materially

               be perpetuated on the pages of a miscellany which has been uniformly zealous in extending
               the well-earned reputation of our rural bard. I must also premise, what affects not
               the merits of the composition in any degree, that Capital Letters and Italic Characters
               were supplied by Mr. Lofft, as were various defects in orthography and punctuation,
               which arose from the Author’s want of Education, and of leisure fitly to supply that
               loss.

         <p class="noCount">PREFACE (1809)</p>
         <p class="noCount">[In the stereotype <em>Poems of Robert Bloomfield</em>, 1809, Bloomfield heavily revised the Preface, removing Lofft’s voice and addressing
            the reader in his own person, while preserving some of the biographical information
            from former editions. He also introduced new material about the circumstances of the
            poem’s composition and publication.]
         </p>
         <p class="noCount"><span class="smcaps">Eight</span> years have elapsed since the first publication of ‘The Farmer’s Boy.’ It now assumes,
            together with the later Poems, a new form; and my friend Mr. Lofft, to whom I am so
            obviously and so materially indebted for success, with great liberality suggests,
            that a general publication of the works in connection seems to require something of
            a general Preface adapted to the occasion, and coming from myself. But as all that
            I have written will now be comprised in two volumes, some further remarks will be
            found in my second volume respecting the Tales and Ballads. What is here said relates
            to the Farmer’s Boy alone.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">The plain, candid memoir, which has hitherto preceded the Poem, as given by my Brother
            to Mr. Lofft, has interested thousands in my favour, and spared me those painful feelings
            which must have arisen from a perpetual recurrence of the same questions in all companies,
            and from a perplexing wish to comply with the natural curiosity of strangers. Wherever
            I have been introduced, almost without exception, my history has been previously known,
            even to the ‘selling of my fiddle,’ and I have immediately been permitted to take
            my seat, and to join the conversation, if I found any thing to say; or to remain silent
            until I did. And this is no small privilege to a man swung at arm’s length into publicity
            with all his mechanical habits and embarrassments about him. How far such habits are,
            or ought to be, overcome, is a question upon which I have not decided: but I have
            been sometimes hurt, or amused, at witnessing the evident disappointment of such persons
            as appeared to expect in the writer of Pastoral poetry, and literally a Cow-boy, the
            brilliancy and the vivacity of polished conversation; to which I never had made the
            slightest pretences.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">The memoir above mentioned has not only relieved me personally in many cases, but
            it has been accompanied by remarks from Mr. Lofft as to the promiscuous gifts which
            God has bestowed on his creatures, without regard to worldly rank, that I am confident
            will redound to the credit of the writer, and which came to the public with a thousand
            times more power and effect than they could have done had I been capable of writing
            them myself.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">Much as I have been benefited by this biographical memoir, and gratified as I have
            been to find my path cleared before me, it would be ungenerous to the purchasers who
            may obtain this new and cheaper edition, and who may have no previous knowledge of
            the Author’s childhood, wholly to omit a narrative of facts which he himself declares
            to be of importance, and to carry with it an interest both connectedly and peculiarly
            its own. I will therefore give the substance of that narrative in my Brother’s words,
            with occasional explanations;—and then resume my own tale.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">In Nov. 1798, G. B. writing to Mr. Lofft, says: ‘As I spent near five years with the
            Author, from the time he was fourteen years and a half years old till he was turned
            of twenty, the most interesting time of life (I mean the time that instruction is
            acquired, if acquired at all), I think I am able to give a better account of him than
            any one can, or than he can of himself: for his modesty would not let him speak of
            his temper, disposition, or morals.

            <p>Robert (born Dec. 3d, 1766,) was the younger child of George Bloomfield, a tailor,
               at Honington.

                        N. E. of Bury. There are three other sons, George, Nathaniel and Isaac, and two daughters.</span></div>
               </div> His father died when he was an infant under a year old. His mother, Elizabeth, the
               daughter of Robert Manby, was born at Brandon, 1736. She was a schoolmistress, and
               instructed her own children with the others. He thus learned to read as soon as he
               learned to speak.
            </p>
         </div>
         <p class="noCount">Though the mother was left a widow with six small children, yet with the help of friends
            she managed to give each of them a little schooling.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">Robert was accordingly sent to Mr. Rodwell, of Ixworth, to be improved in writing:
            but he did not go to that school more than two or three months, nor was ever sent
            to any other; his mother again marrying when Robert was about seven years old.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">By her second husband, John Glover, she had another family.</p>
         <div class="wrapper">
            <p>When Robert was not above eleven years old, the late Mr. W. Austin, of Sapiston,
               <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note103" id="Note103_return"><sup class="super">

               </div> took him. And though it is customary for farmers to pay such boys only 1s. 6d. per
               week, yet he generously took him into the house. This relieved his mother of any other
               expense than only of finding him a few things to wear: and this was more than she
               well knew how to do.
            </p>
         </div>
         <p class="noCount">She wrote therefore to me and my brother Nat (then in London), to assist her; mentioning
            that Robert was so small of his age that Mr. Austin said he was not likely to be able
            to get his living by hard labour.’
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">The following anecdote must stand in Mr. Lofft’s words, as one of those tender fabrics
            which it would be very easy to spoil, and impossible to mend.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">‘Mr. G. Bloomfield on this informed his mother that, if she would let him take the
            boy with him, he would take him, and teach him to make shoes: and Nat promised to
            clothe him. The mother, upon this offer, took coach and came to London, to Mr. G.
            Bloomfield, with the boy: for she said, she never should have been happy if she had
            not put him herself into his hands.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">“She charged me,” he adds, “<span class="ital">as I valued a mother’s blessing, to watch over him, to set good examples for him,
               and never to forget that he had lost his father</span>”. I religiously confine myself to Mr. G. Bloomfield’s own words; and I think I should
            wrong all the parties concerned, if, in mentioning this pathetic and successful admonition,
            I were to use any other.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">Mr. G. Bloomfield then lived at Mr. Simm’s, No. 7, Pitcher’s-court, Bell-alley, Coleman-street.
            “It is customary,” he continues, “in such houses as are let to poor people in London,
            to have light garrets fit for mechanics to work in. In the garret, where we had two
            turn-up beds, and five of us worked, I received little Robert.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">As we were all single men, lodgers at a shilling per week each, our beds were coarse,
            and all things far from being clean and snug, like what <span class="ital">Robert</span> had left at Sapiston. <span class="ital">Robert</span> was our man, to fetch all things to hand. At noon he fetched our dinners from the
            cook’s shop: and any one of our fellow workmen that wanted to have any thing fetched
            in, would send him, and assist in his work and teach him, for a recompense for his
            trouble.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">Every day when the Boy from the Public-house came for the pewter pots, and to hear
            what Porter was wanted, he always brought the yesterday’s newspaper. The <span class="ital">reading</span> of the Paper we had been used to take by turns; but after <span class="ital">Robert</span> came, he mostly read for us,—because his time was of least value.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">He frequently met with words that he was unacquainted with: of this he often complained.
            I one day happened at a book-stall to see a small dictionary, which had been very
            ill used. I bought it for him for 4d. By the help of this he in little time could
            read and comprehend the long and beautiful speeches of Burke, Fox, or North.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">One Sunday, after an whole day’s stroll in the country, we by accident went into a
            dissenting meeting-house in the Old Jewry, where a gentleman was lecturing. This man
            filled little Robert with astonishment. The house was amazingly crowded with the most
            genteel people; and though we were forced to stand still in the aisle, and were much
            pressed, yet Robert always quickened his steps to get into the town on a Sunday evening
            soon enough to attend this lecture.

         <p class="noCount">He went sometimes with me to a debating society at Coachmaker’s-hall, but not often;
            and a few times to Covent-garden theatre. These are all the opportunities he ever
            had to learn from public speakers. As to Books, he had to wade through two or three
            Folios: an History of England, British Traveller, and a Geography. But he always read
            them as a task, or to oblige us who bought them. And as they came in sixpenny numbers
            weekly, he had about as many hours to read as other boys spend in play.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">I at that time read the <em>London Magazine</em>; and in that work about two sheets were set apart for a Review—Robert seemed always
            eager to read this review. Here he could see what the literary men were doing, and
            learn how to judge of the merits of the works that come out. And I observed that he
            always looked at the Poet’s Corner. And one day he repeated a Song which he composed
            to an old tune. I was much surprised that he should make so smooth verses; so I persuaded
            him to try whether the Editor of our Paper would give them a place in Poet’s Corner.
            And he succeeded, and they were printed. And as I forget his other early productions,
            I shall copy this.

                        ‘The Soldier’s Return.’ It has been printed in a former edition of this work. [The
                        full poem was included in the ‘Advertisement’ to the 8th edn]</span></div>
               </div> in which he tried to describe the feelings of an honest Tar, who, after a long absence,
               saw his dear native Village first rising into view. This too obtain’d a place in the
               Poet’s Corner. And as he was so young, it shews some genius in him, and some industry,
               to have acquired so much knowledge of the use of words in so little time. Indeed at
               this time myself and my fellow workmen in the garret began to get instructions from
               him.
            </p>
         </div>
         <p class="noCount">About this time there came a man to lodge at our lodgings that was troubled with fits.
            Robert was so much hurt to see this poor creature drawn into such frightful forms,
            and to hear his horrid screams, that I was forced to leave the lodging. We went to
            Blue Hart-court, Bell-alley. In our new garret we found a singular character, James
            Kay, a native of Dundee. He was a middle-aged man, of a good understanding, and yet
            a furious Calvinist. He had many books,—and some which he did not value: such as the
            Seasons, Paradise Lost, and some Novels. These books he lent to Robert; who spent
            all his leisure hours in reading The Seasons, which he was now capable of reading.
            I never heard him give so much praise to any book as to that.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">I think it was in the year 1784 that the question came to be decided between the journeymen
            shoemakers; whether those who had learn’d without serving an apprenticeship could
            follow the trade?
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">The man by whom Robert and I were employ’d, Mr. Chamberlayne, of Cheapside, took an
            active part against the lawful journeymen; and even went so far as to pay off every
            man that worked for him that had joined their clubs. This so exasperated the men,
            that their acting committee soon looked for unlawful men (as they called them) among
            Chamberlayne’s workmen.’
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">A part of the Narrative here naturally turned upon the spiteful and contentious bickerings
            of men who were all angry together; which contentions ultimately forced me from London.
            At this moment I feel much obliged to them. They treated me with a visit to my friends,
            and a charming holiday; which George thus describes:
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">‘Robert naturally fond of Peace, and fearful for my personal safety, begged to be
            suffered to retire from the storm.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">He came home; and Mr. Austin kindly bade him take his house for his home till he could
            return to me. And here, with his mind glowing with the fine descriptions of rural
            scenery which he found in Thomson’s Seasons, he again retraced the very fields where
            first he began to think. Here, free from smoke, the noise, the contention of the city,
            he imbibed that love of rural simplicity and rural innocence, which fitted him, in
            a great degree, to be the writer of such a thing as “The Farmer’s Boy”.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">Here he lived two months:—at length, as the dispute in the trade still remained undecided,
            Mr. Dudbridge offered to take Robert apprentice, to secure him, at all events, from
            any consequences of the litigation.’
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">The indentures were avowedly for the above purpose only; and, after detailing the
            transaction, George proceeds thus: 
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">‘When I left London he was turned of twenty and much of my happiness since has arisen
            from a constant correspondence which I have held with him.

         <p class="noCount">But as my brother Nat had married a Woolwich woman, it happened that Robert took a
            fancy to Mary-Anne Church, a young woman of that town, whose father is a boat-builder
            in the Government yard there. He married 12th Dec. 1790.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">Soon after he married, Robert told me, in a letter, that ‘he had sold his fiddle and
            got a wife.’ Like most poor men, he got a wife first, and had to get household stuff
            afterward. It took him some time to get out of ready-furnished lodgings. At length,
            by hard working, &amp;c he acquired a bed of his own, and hired the room up one pair of
            stairs at 14, Bell-alley, Coleman-street. The landlord kindly gave him leave to sit
            and work in the light garret, two pair of stairs higher.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">In this garret, amid six or seven other workmen, his active mind employed itself in
            composing ‘The Farmer’s Boy.’
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">In my correspondence I have seen several poetical effusions of his; all of them of
            a good moral tendency; but which he very likely would think do him little credit:
            on that account I have not preserved them.

            <p>Robert is a lady’s shoemaker, and works for Mr. Davies, Lombard-street. He is of a
               slender make; of about five feet four inches high; very dark complexion. His mother,
               who is a very religious member of the church of England, took all the pains she could
               in his infancy to make him pious: and, as his reason expanded, his love of God and
               man increased with it. I never knew his fellow for mildness of temper and goodness
               of disposition. And since I left him, universally is he praised by those who know

            not despise

         </div>
         <p class="noCount">Further information was given soon after by my Brother in the following Letter to
            Mr. Lofft, and in the anecdote which closes this part of the history:
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">‘The late Mr. Austin’s wife was a Manby (my mother’s sister). And it may seem strange
            that, in “The Farmer’s Boy,” <span class="ital">Giles</span> no where calls him Uncle, but Master. The treatment that my brother Robert experienced
            from Mr. Austin did not differ in any respect from the treatment that all the servant
            boys experienced who lived with him. Mr. Austin was the father of fourteen children
            by my aunt (he never had any other wife). He left a decent provision for the five
            children that survived him: so that it could not be expected he should have any thing
            to give to poor relations. And I don’t see a possibility of making a difference between
            <span class="ital">Giles</span> and the boys that were not related to Mr. Austin: or he treated all his servants
            exactly as he did his sons. They all worked hard; all lived well. The Duke had not
            a better man tenant to him than the late Mr. Austin. I saw numbers of the husbandmen
            in tears when he was buried. He was beloved by all who knew him. But I imagine that
            Robert thought that when he was speaking of Benevolence that was universal, he had
            no occasion to mention the accidental circumstance of his being related to the good
            man of whom he sung.’
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">_______</p>
         <p class="noCount">‘I have him in my mind’s eye a little boy; not bigger than boys generally are at twelve
            years old. When I met him and his mother at the inn, he strutted before us, dressed
            just as he came from keeping sheep, hogs, &amp;c. his shoes filled full of stumps in the
            heels. He looking about him, slipped up—his nails were unused to a flat pavement.
            I remember viewing him as he scampered up: how small he was. Little thought, that
            little, fatherless boy would be one day known and esteemed by the most learned, the
            most respected, the wisest, and the best men of the kingdom.’
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">________</p>
         <p class="noCount">Amongst the anecdotes interspersed in the foregoing Narrative, distinguished for ingenuousness
            and feeling, that which the reader has just seen, if worth correcting in a slight
            particular, may be done here; and I would not do it but that I find the fact, trifling
            as it may appear to some, has been repeatedly noticed. George states that he received
            his brother in London, ‘dressed just as he came from keeping sheep, hogs, &amp;c.’ Now
            the strict truth of the case is this; that I came (on the 29th of June, 1781) in my
            Sunday clothes, such as they were; for I well remember the palpitation of my heart
            on receiving his proposals to come to town, and how incessantly I thought of the change
            I was going to experience: remember well selling my smock frock for a shilling, and
            slyly washing my best hat in the horsepond, to give it a gloss fit to appear in the
            meridian of London. On entering Whitechapel, riding backwards on the coach, a long
            line of carriages in the centre of the street attracted my particular notice; and
            I anxiously looked for the principal object in that procession of which I conceived
            them to be a part: little dreaming that they all stood for hire! But these are surely
            trifling anecdotes; and I will endeavour to record something more important.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">Taking it then for granted, that my history, so far as it has been stated, is fully
            and sufficiently known, I mean to elucidate a fact or two to which an allusion has
            been made in the former Preface, so as to throw an additional light on subjects which
            I am persuaded will not be deemed uninteresting by the lovers of literature.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">It cannot be forgotten by any one who has thought of my history and success, that
            Mr. Lofft has said, when speaking of the MS. of this Poem, that ‘it had before been
            shown to some persons in London; whose indifference toward it may probably he explained,
            when it is considered that it came to their hands under no circumstances of adventitious
            recommendation. With some a person must be rich, or titled, or fashionable as a literary
            name, or at least fashionable in some respect, good or bad, before any thing which
            he can offer will be thought worthy of notice’.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">Nothing surely can so effectually illustrate this fact as a plain account of my unsuccessful
            attempts in publicly stating which, on such an occasion as this, I see not the smallest
            impropriety; as it may teach men in my own station of life not to despair, if they
            feel themselves morally and intellectually worthy of notice; and at the same time
            teach them not to <span class="ital">rely</span> on an untried and brittle support, by throwing away the honourable staff of mechanic
            independence.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">The following papers, which I now transcribe from originals, and copies in my possession,
            accompanied the MS. of ‘The Farmer’s Boy’ to my brother George, at St. Edmund’s Bury,
            to whom they are addressed. I have endeavoured to arrange them so as to make the story
            as simple and as straight forward as possible.

                        for an author to tell his opinion, they have never lost an inch of ground in my estimation

               will be at liberty to detain it as long as you please; and I have no doubt but some
               parts of it will please you. I would wish you to observe well the following remarks,
               and I wish you to be candid if it should ever draw any remarks from you.

         <p class="noCount">When I began it, I thought to myself that I could complete it in a twelvemonth, allowing
            myself three months for each quarter; but I soon found that I could not; and indeed
            I made it longer than I at first intended. Nine tenths of it were put together as
            I sat at work, where there are usually six of us. No one in the house has any knowledge
            of what I have employed my thoughts about when I did not talk.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">I chose to do it in rhime for this reason; because I found always that when I put
            two or three lines together in blank verse, or something that sounded like it, it
            was ten to one if it stood right when it came to be written down. Winter and half
            of Autumn were done long before I could find leisure to write them. In the ‘Harvest
            Home’ you will find the essence of letters which you wrote formerly to London.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">When I had nearly done it, it came strongly into my mind that very silly things are
            sometimes printed; but by what means I knew not. To try to get at this knowledge,
            I resolved to make some efforts of that sort; and what encouraged me to go through
            with it was, that, if I got laughed at, no one that I cared for could know it, unless
            I myself told them. I sometimes thought of venturing it into the house of some person
            above a bookseller; but I never could find impudence enough to do it. So I carried
            it, accompanied with the following letter, to your magazine man. He kept it eight
            or ten days, and then sent a sober-looking, book faced man back with it, sending therewith

            a present to an aged Mother, now living on the spot; to whom the Church, the Mad Girl,
            the Farm-house, and all the local circumstances of the piece, are intimately known.
            Before I send it away, something persuades me that I might possibly find some person
            capable, and possessing condescension enough to satisfy me in a desire I feel of knowing
            whether the little piece, particularly the latter half, Autumn and Winter, contains
            any thing like poetical merit; that is to say, to what excellence in others it makes

         <p class="noCount">If the Poem now left in your hands, containing something less than fifteen hundred
            lines, should be fortunate enough to gain an hour of your leisure, you can then judge
            whether it is in itself worthy of publication; or, what is perhaps more to the point,
            whether there is any probability of its repaying you, Sir, or myself, the expense
            of publication. What that expense would be I know not; therefore can form no judgment
            by myself without further information. All I can say is, that I could wish to see
            it printed, if it were possible to have it done. If I hear nothing on these heads,
            shall conclude that the little piece is unworthy your notice, and shall take care
            that it be called for again.

         <p class="noCount">‘Mr. ******s compliments to Mr. Bloomfield, and is much obliged to him for the offer
            of his manuscript; but as <span class="ital">poetry</span> is quite out of his line, he begs leave to decline it.’
         </p>
         <p class="noCount"><span class="date">22 June, 1798.</span></p>
         <p class="noCount">I had now to find somebody who <span class="ital">did </span>print poetry. I accordingly left it with Mr. *******, and with it a copy of the letter
            I had written to Mr. ******* (No. 3.) He kept it so long that I had to call several
            times before I could get it. At last I went when he was in the way. The shopman, knowing
            my errand, went into the compting-house, and presently came out with my book in his
            hand, and asked me to step that way (to the back of the shop). I hesitated—but I had
            gone too far to retreat. I went and took it, and was told to go into the compting-house.
            When I went in, Mr. ******* spoke thus, as nearly as I can recollect:—‘Your poetry,
            Mr. Bloomfield, I am afraid, won’t do for separate publication; unless you can get
            some person to revise it for you. As you wish to see it printed, I think you had better
            take it to some person who publishes a magazine. I think your wisest way would be
            to take it to Mr. ******; and I have no doubt but he will insert it for you,’ &amp;c.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">I left him: and, as I should not like to buy my own rhimes, I did not take his advice.
            I could wish to say more on this subject, but the parcel is waiting for my budget.
            Pray remember this:—don’t give the book to my Mother, nor to any one else, till you
            hear from me again.

         <p class="noCount"><span class="smcaps">Dear George</span>,
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">I Finished my last rather abruptly for want of time.—If I had given my little piece
            to Mr. *******, even supposing that he would have accepted it, it would then have
            taken perhaps six months at least, by monthly continuations, before it would all have
            been printed. My chief pride would have been to have sent my Mother <span class="ital">a printed copy</span>; but, at the above rate, one copy only would have cost six shillings: I therefore
            send it as it is. I never wrote it out but once. I have no copy of it, except in my
            memory. You will find the copies of my letters to the parties miserably blotted, they
            were written in haste: I meant to have transcribed them, but had not time.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">Having never been instructed in grammar, it may abound in faults of that kind which
            I am not aware of. The management of stops I don’t pretend to. I desired you not to
            show it for this reason; because I think it would look awkward to give it even to
            my Mother without some kind of introductory letter.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">You will perceive that the information I principally wanted to gain, I could not gain;
            that is, how to go about printing such a thing, and what it would cost. But as I could
            not send my Mother <span class="ital">a printed copy</span>, I don’t trouble myself much to know whether it was want of merit, or want of patronage,
            that made me fail.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">You say you find pleasure in reading it; perhaps it arises principally from this:
            you know all the situations, circumstances, and persons introduced into it. I wish
            that pleasure may continue to you, and such of our friends as may happen to get hold
            of it.—All well.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">Your affectionate Brother,</p>
         <p class="noCount"><span class="smcaps">Robert Bloomfield</span></p>
         <p class="noCount">Such were the efforts which I found courage enough to make; and here <span class="ital">my</span> efforts ended. Not so with my Brother. With the foregoing information in his hands,
            he asked me by letter whether I had any objection to his showing the Poem to his neighbour
            Mr. Lofft, whom I had never seen, nor of whose readiness to assist the poor or the
            ignorant had an equal knowledge with my Brother, who lived on the spot. I left it
            to him to do as he proposed, and not to miss so fair a chance of getting a sound critical
            opinion, and that accompanied with feeling and good manners. George immediately carried
            the Poem to Troston, with the following paper, which I now copy from his own hand-writing.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount"><span class="ital">To</span> <span class="smcaps">Capel Lofft</span>, <span class="ital">Esq.</span></p>
         <p class="noCount">Bury, Nov. 1798.</p>
         <p class="noCount">‘<span class="smcaps">Sir</span>,
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">Common fame speaks of the willingness that you show in giving your counsel and advice
            to the poor. This benevolent trait in your character has emboldened me to approach
            you, to petition you to give your opinion on the enclosed piece. I fancy I see beauties
            in it, and was thinking of applying to one of our printers to know, if, from the locality
            of it, it would pay for printing (for ’tis a Suffolk piece); but it struck my mind
            forcibly, that I should stand a better chance of meeting with that ingenuousness I
            wish for, by begging the opinion of a man of genius and taste, than by applying to
            a tradesman.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">Since I have had the Poem in my hands I have never shown it to any one, nor spoke
            of it; nor does any one here know of this application.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">If, Sir, you will deign to give your opinion, I will never mention your name, unless
            by your permission. This, I hope, will not be deemed an impertinent intrusion; for
            ’tis the high rank you hold in the literary world prompted me to this, because on
            your judgment I can rely with satisfaction.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">Let the result of this be what it may, your petitioner will ever revere your name.</p>

            kept him, from motives of charity.’
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">The consequences which arose from this application are too well known to be repeated;
            yet there were circumstances attending the progress of the Poem through the press
            which are not known, but might be made known with honour to all the parties concerned.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">The first letter I received from Mr. Lofft was to me a cordial not to be described.
            In others which immediately followed I found the ensuing remarks:
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">‘At the same time the example, as well as the Poem, may teach the rich, and the highly
            born or educated, not unnaturally to urge harsh and overbearing lines of distinction;
            but to be more attentive to the gifts bestowed by the common Father on mankind, than
            to an overweening conceit of their own privileges and advantages.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">Their privileges and advantages would amply gain in good will and security, what they
            might thus sacrifice from the cold and degrading claims of unfeeling ostentation.’

                        which I find, by comparing dates, happened to be during the last illness of Robert
                        Burns, and about three months before his death. If it should be suspected that I mention
                        this with a view of strengthening an apparent approximation to so illustrious an example
                        of intellect and poetic excellence, the reader will do a great injustice to me, and

         <p class="noCount">The printing was now going on, and that I knew little of its progress (which was the
            case) I have only to blame myself. I seldom called to enquire after it. I knew it
            to be in good hands. Yet, during the fifteen months which elapsed before its publication,
            the latter part of which time was attended by very bad health, I felt much anxiety;
            and, (having the Poem then perfect in my memory,) after a hard day’s work, with my
            back to the fire, and in the stillness of the night, I have often repeated aloud the
            whole, or greater part of the Poem, until my wife was fast asleep, before I could
            find resolution to put out the candle. The reader who disdains such little anecdotes
            had better lay down the book; for I shall proceed in my own way.

         <div class="wrapper">
            <p>At length, in March 1800, my brother Nathaniel (with whom I wish the world was better
               acquainted) called to say that he had seen, in a shop window, a book called The Farmer’s
               Boy, with a motto. I told him I supposed it must be mine; but I know nothing of the
               motto: and I the more believed it to be mine, having just received through the hands
               of Mr. Lofft a request to wait on the Duke of Grafton, in Piccadilly. I had a very
               slight personal remembrance of the Duke from my childhood; and I felt as most men
               would feel in my circumstances on a similar occasion.

               </div> I met with condescension in its noblest features, and even with congratulations; and
               amongst the conversation was very naturally asked, ‘How I liked the execution of the
               work? Was it not beautifully printed?’&amp;c. I replied, that I had not yet seen it. The
               Duke himself then brought from the library one of the large paper copies, and spread
               it on the table. <span class="ital">Giles</span> never was so hard put to it in his life to keep his face in order as at that moment.
               At that moment the Preface was <span class="ital">as new to me as the Poem was to the world</span>. I could not read it there; but on my return home I saw the high praise which my
               Brother had given me, and which had been so advantageously laid before the public
               by Mr. Lofft. I thanked them both for having spared me the task of telling my own
               story, thanked God for his providential interposition, and felt my heart at ease.

               in Whittlebury Forest, Northamptonshire; upon which visit I find recorded the following
               remark:
            </p>
         </div>
         <div class="wrapper">
            <p>‘When I was at Wakefield Lodge I conceited that I saw the workmen and neighbours look
               at me as at an idle fellow. I had nothing to do but to read, look at them, and their
               country and concerns. They did not seem to know how to estimate me. I was not a constant
               companion at the Duke’s table,

                        in my own way. See ‘Lines written on a Visit to Whittlebury Forest, addressed to my
                        children.’ Vol. II.</span></div>
               </div> nor was I much in his company; yet, seeing me noticed with attention by the family,
               that attention was caught, and dealt out to me at second-hand. I sometimes thought
               of the Spectator when at Sir Roger De Coverly’s, and of the <span class="ital">silent gentleman</span> whom nobody knew much about. Six months only before that time I was in sickness and
               trouble; sometimes two, sometimes three days in a week racked with a head-ach that
               nearly drove me distracted. To lie down almost destitute of the necessaries of life,
               tortured with pain till I cried out, and that pain augmented by the sight of a wife
               and three children whom I could not help, was certainly a hard trial for my philosophy.
               The Poem became public in two months after, and my first relief was from the hand
               of the right worthy owner of Wakefield Lodge. What a glorious thing is a present of
               ——— to a man in distress! If hundreds should arise from my writings, I question if
               hundreds will produce the exquisite sweetness of that ———.’

         </div>
         <p class="noCount">From the above date I found, however unfit to meet prosperity, and a total change
            of company and connections, that such a change could not be avoided. I became known
            to the literary, and esteemed by the good. Sir Charles Bunbury, and many worthy characters
            in Suffolk, gave me the welcome of a friend and a countryman. At Troston, under the
            hospitable roof of Mr. Lofft, I was every way at home. My London and country wellwishers
            have increased, until to name them would wear the appearance of ostentation, which
            I much wish to avoid. And yet, while I boast in my possession the hand-writing of
            the late Mr. Fox, I hardly know whether I am justified in altogether refraining. Let
            not then any of them imagine that I have failed to cherish a grateful regard for the
            zeal and endeavours of them all. I write with an overflowing heart: and could I feel
            otherwise than I do, should unquestionably be unworthy of their attention.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">Very trifling emendations have taken place in this Stereotype Edition. One, however,
            may seem worthy of notice. In the description of the Mad Girl I had originally called
            her <span class="ital">Poll</span>; but on my visit to Suffolk, after an absence of twelve years (which gave rise to
            the Lines that follow this Preface), I learned that her name was <span class="ital">Ann</span>. I conversed with her, and found her greatly recovered, and sensible of her past
            calamity. Instead of giving this information in a note, I have, partly from choice,
            and partly from the nature of the printing, inserted <span class="ital">Ann</span> for <span class="ital">Poll</span> in the text.
         </p>
         <p class="noCount">I have the gratification to <span class="ital">know</span> that this Poem has given pleasure to thousands, and to make a contrary pretence would
            be something worse than affectation. Upon this conviction I rest my claim (with all
            due submission to the learned) of exhorting all persons of acknowledged taste and
            ability, when they receive a poor man’s production, to read it with candour, and to
            judge of it with truth: so that, if it be found entitled to a share of public attention,
            the unlettered and the unfriended may not lose their chance of communicating instruction
            or entertainment to the world.

               </p>
               <p class="noCount">Hitherto the biographical narrative, as given originally by my brother, in letters
                  to my good friend <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LofftCapel">Mr. Lofft</a>, has gone undisturbed. Though I have often doubted the accuracy of the dates, the
                  facts themselves remain unimpeachable. I had, indeed, convinced my brother, that he
                  inadvertently mis-stated my age, on coming to London; and, by my wish, the reader
                  was told, in the preface to the former editions, that my juvenile pieces, there referred
                  to, and of which fragments are given, were written in the year 1784. As I certainly
                  transgressed in rhyme from the age of fifteen years and a half until twenty, writing
                  pieces of various descriptions, the doubt on my mind was, whether my brother, who
                  saw them all, could tell, any more than myself, on being questioned fourteen years
                  after the time, at what particular date the pieces were actually written or published,
                  which he had mentioned to Mr. Lofft; for I well remember, more than once, to have
                  received the sentence of, ‘R. B. is inadmissible.’
               </p>
               <p class="noCount">To satisfy my curiosity, and arrive at the truth, I have examined the files of old
                  newspapers, as they are preserved at Peel’s Coffee-house, Fleet-street; beginning
                  with 1784; at which time, in my seventeenth year, I supposed them to have been written.
                  My trouble was repaid, by finding the objects of my search under the date of 1786.
                  Whatever merit or puerility may be found in the pieces I have thus unexpectedly regained,
                  and which I had endeavoured to recollect, they appear to have been written, or at
                  least published, between the ages of nineteen and twenty; and, consequently, any reader
                  of taste will believe, on perusing them, that they are here given to the world, more
                  from the love of truth than the love of praise; and will, at the same time, observe,
                  that the copy of ‘A Village Girl,’ as given from memory by <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BloomfieldGeorge">my brother</a>, was not quite correct.
               </p>
               <p class="noCount">I lay down all reputed juvenile excellence with infinite satisfaction; and, though
                  some may blame this kind of self exposure, I can make up the account to my own conscience,
                  and am determined to believe, that, whatever different opinions may be entertained
                  as to the nature and proper limits of biography, to rectify mistakes is to do right;
                  and to tell truth, the first duty of us all.
               </p>
               <p class="noCount">If it should be asked, why I did not make the search before the publication of the
                  ‘Farmer’s Boy’ I answer, that I did well to trust to the kind hand which was about
                  to lift me from obscurity and distress; that I had then no doubt of the accuracy of
                  the dates, nor the least knowledge that such newspapers were any where in existence;
                  and, lastly, I had not then a Coffee-house coat to my back, to carry me through the
                  enquiry.
               </p>
               <p class="noCount">There will be found in these little pieces, obscurities and bad grammar, they are
                  exact copies from the papers, and as I wrote them; except in the instances marked
                  at the foot of each piece, the editors of the papers not thinking it worth their while
                  to correct them. The reader will recognise in them the ‘provincial usage’ mentioned
                  by Mr. Lofft, at page xvi. of the following preface.

               <p class="noCount">* Copied from ‘Almon’s General Advertiser,’ for Nov. 11, 1786.</p>
               <p class="noCount">** The above lines were suggested by the return of some regiments from the East Indies,
                  as the verses themselves will evince. The word ‘flow,’ was substituted by the editor
                  of the paper for the original word ‘offspring.’ This I remembered, and gave the original
                  in the fragment I sent to Mr. Lofft. But, in the 4th stanza, the original word had
                  escaped all recollection, until this unexpected sight of the piece, and of its connection,
                  so that if ‘hardships’ be read for ‘ought,’ all the meaning I had will be seen. I
                  perfectly remember feeling rather indignant, at seeing myself so badly corrected;
                  and this feeling, perhaps, engraved those trifles on my mind much deeper than they
                  deserved.
