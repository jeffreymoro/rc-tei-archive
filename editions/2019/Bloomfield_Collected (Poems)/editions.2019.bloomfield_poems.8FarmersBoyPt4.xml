              volume. [Text of note; also in fMS Eng 776:] <hi rend="smcaps">Allowing</hi> for the imperfect state of sublunary happiness, which is comparative at best,
              there are not, perhaps, many nations existing whose situation is so desirable; where the means of subsistence are so easy, and the wants
              of the people so few. …The evident distinction of ranks, which subsists at <hi rend="ital">Otaheite, </hi>does not so materially affect
              the felicity of the nation as we might have supposed. The simplicity of their whole life contributes to soften the appearance of
              distinctions, and to reduce them to a level. Where the climate and the custom of the country do not absolutely require a perfect
              garment; where it is easy at every step to gather as many plants as form not only a decent, but likewise a customary covering; and where
              all the necessaries of life are within the reach of every individual, at the expence of a trifling labour; … ambition and envy must in a
              great measure be unknown. It is true, the highest classes of people possess some dainty articles, such as pork, fish, fowl, and cloth,
              almost exclusively; but the desire of indulging the appetite in a few trifling luxuries can at most render individuals, and not whole
              nations, unhappy. Absolute want occasions the miseries of the lower class in some civilized states, and is the result of the unbounded
              voluptuousness of their superiors. At <hi rend="ital">Otaheite </hi>there is not, in general, that disparity between the highest and the
              meanest man, that subsists in England between a reputable tradesman and a labourer. The affection of the Otaheitans for their chiefs,
              which they never failed to express upon all occasions, gave us great reason to suppose that they consider themselves as one family, and
              respect their eldest born in the persons of their chiefs. The lowest man in the nation speaks as freely with his king as with his equal,
              and has the pleasure of seeing him as often as he likes. The king, at times, amuses himself with the occupations of his subjects; and
              not yet depraved by false notions of empty state, he often paddles his own canoe, without considering such an employment derogatory to
              his dignity. How long such an happy equality may last is uncertain, and how much the introduction of foreign luxuries may hasten its
              dissolution cannot be too frequently repeated to Europeans. If the knowledge of a few individuals can only be acquired at such a price
              as the happiness of nations, it were better for the discoverers and the discovered that the <hi rend="ital">South Sea </hi>had still

              knowing but it was written by Cook himself, which I now find was not the case. I was quite uncertain during the 15 Months which the poem
              remaind in the hands of Mr Lofft and the publishers, whither this note would be printed or not. I was pleading for kindness between the
              ranks of society, and it seemd to suit my purpose. And if I could believe that what I said of Letting “Labour have its due” would only
              in one instance perswade a Farmer to give his men more wages, instead of giving, or suffering him to buy cheap corn in the time of
              trouble, I should feel a pleasure of the most lasting sort, having no doubt but that an extra half Crown earned is worth, morally, and
