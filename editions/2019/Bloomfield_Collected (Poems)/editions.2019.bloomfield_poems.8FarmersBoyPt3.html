               <p class="noCount">[3rd–14th edns add a note by Capel Lofft (absent in <em>Poems [Stereotype]</em>):] In these verses, which have much of picturesque, there is a severe charge against
                  <span class="ital">Rooks</span> and <span class="ital">Crows</span>, as very formidable depredators; and their destruction, as such, seems to be recommended.
                  Such was the prevalent opinion some years back. It is less general now: and I am sure
                  the humanity of the Author, and his benevolence to Animals in general, will dispose
                  him to rejoice in whatever plea can be offered in stay of execution of this sentence.
                  And yet more so, if it shall appear that <span class="smcaps">Rooks</span>, at least, deserve not only mercy, but <span class="ital">protection</span> and <span class="ital">encouragement</span> from the Farmer.</p>
               <p class="noCount">I shall quote a passage from <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BewickThomas"><span class="smcaps">Bewick’s</span></a> interesting <span class="smcaps">History</span> of <span class="smcaps">Birds</span>: the narrative part of which is often as full of information as the embellishments
                  cut in wood are beautiful… It is this.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Speaking of Birds of the <span class="smcaps">Pie-kind</span> in general, he says ‘Birds of this kind [p. 63] are found in every part of the known
                  world, from Greenland to the Cape of Good Hope. In many respects they may be said
                  to be of singular benefit to mankind: principally by destroying great quantities of
                  noxious insects, worms, and reptiles. <span class="smcaps">Rooks</span>, in particular, are fond of the erucæ of <span class="ital">the hedge-chaffer, </span>or chesnut <span class="ital">brown beetles </span>for which they search with indefatigable pains. These insects,’ he adds in a note,
                  ‘appear in hot weather in formidable numbers: disrobing the fields and trees of their
                  verdure, blossoms, and fruit; spreading desolation and destruction wherever they go…They
                  appeared in great numbers in <span class="smcaps">Ireland</span> during a hot summer, and committed great ravages. In the year 1747 whole meadows
                  and corn-fields were destroyed by them in <span class="smcaps">Suffolk</span>. The decrease of Rookeries in that County was thought to be the occasion of it. The
                  many Rookeries with us is in some measure the reason why we have so few of these destructive
                  animals.’ [Wallis’s History of Northumberland.]</p> 
               <p class="noCount">‘Rooks,’ he subjoins, ‘are often accus’d of feeding on the corn just after it has
                  been sown, and various contrivances have been made both to kill and frighten them
                  away; but, in our estimation, the advantages deriv’d from the destruction which they
                  make among grubs, earth-worms, and noxious insects of various kinds, will greatly
                  overpay the injury done to the future harvest by the small quantity of corn they may
                  destroy in searching after their favourite food’. [Lofft further notes:] Mr. Bewick
                  does not seem to have been quite aware that much of the mischief, as I have been informed
                  by a sensible neighbouring Farmer and Tenant, is done in the grub-state of the chaffer
                  by biting through the <span class="ital">roots </span>of grass, &amp;c. A latent, and imperceptibly, but rapidly spreading mischief, against
                  which the <span class="ital">rooks </span>and birds of similar instinct are, in a manner, the sole protection. C. L.]</p> 
               <p class="noCount">‘In general they are sagacious, active, and faithful to each other. They live in pairs;
                  and their mutual attachment is constant. They are a clamorous race: mostly build in
                  trees, and form a kind of society in which there appears something like a regular
                  government. A Centinel watches for the general safety, and gives notice on the appearance
                  of danger.’</p>
               <p class="noCount">Under the Title, ‘<span class="smcaps">Rooks</span>,’ (p. 71) Mr. <span class="smcaps">Bewick</span> repeats his observations on the useful property of this Bird.</p>
               <p class="noCount">I confess myself solicitous for their safety and kind treatment. We have two which
                  were lam’d by being blown down in a storm (a calamity which destroys great numbers
                  almost every spring). One of them is perfectly domesticated. The other is yet more
                  remarkable; since although enjoying his natural liberty completely, he recognizes,
                  even in his flights at a distance from the house, his adoptive home, his human friends,
                  and early protectors.</p>
               <p class="noCount">The <span class="smcaps">Rook</span> is certainly a very beautiful and very sensible Bird; very confiding, and very much
                  attach’d. It will give me a pleasure, in which I doubt not the Author of this delightful
                  Poem will partake, if any thing here said shall avail them with the Farmer; and especially
                  with the <span class="smcaps">Suffolk Farmer</span>. C. L.</p></span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
