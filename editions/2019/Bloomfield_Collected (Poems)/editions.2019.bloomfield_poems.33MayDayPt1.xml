        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">Introduction</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">By 1811, Bloomfield was finding that, despite the enormous sales of his first three collections, the
          income from his poetry was no longer sufficient to provide him and his family with a living. There were many mouths to feed—not just his
          immediate family but those of his brothers Isaac and George. There were also spiralling expenses repairing <ref type="m"
            target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#GloverElizabeth">his mother’s</ref> house in Suffolk. He
          sought to reduce outgoings by moving from London to the Bedfordshire village of <ref type="m"
            target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/places.html#Shefford">Shefford</ref>, hoping to rediscover the
          placedness in village life that he recalled in his Suffolk youth. But in Shefford poverty loomed as <ref type="m"
            target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#VernorThomas">Vernor</ref> and <ref type="m"
            target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#HoodThomas">Hood</ref> went bankrupt and the book trade
          retrenched. From 1816, the postwar economic recession made matters worse, making it hard to interest publishers in new works. Changing
          taste, in a nation used to daily news of battles, played a part: Byron’s and Scott’s chivalric tales, full of thrilling, heroic action,
          became the new vogue; Bloomfield’s village tales, bucolic and comic, seemed tame by comparison.</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Bloomfield’s eclipse was gradual but irreversible. In 1814 the onetime market leader was tentative but
          hopeful: ‘I somtimes dream’, he wrote, ‘that I shall one day venture again before the public somthing in my old manner, some country tales,
          and spiced with love and courtship might yet please, for Rural life by the art of Cooking may be made a relishing and high flavourd dish,
          whatever it may be in reality’ (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.294.html">Letter
          294</ref>, 4 October 1814). Advancing arthritis, partial blindness, and debilitating migraines impeded his capacity to write however, and no
          new publication appeared in the next seven years. By 1819, he at least had manuscript material to offer publishers, but found them
          unenthusiastic, telling his daughter ‘I am grieved to wound your feelings, but I realy doubt that myself and my poetry are out of fashion
          from the taste of the times. <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BaldwinRobert"
            >Baldwin</ref> is cold, and I have tried through <ref type="m"
            target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#ParkThomas">Mr Park</ref> and <ref type="m"
            target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#RogersSamuel">Mr Rogers</ref> to get the poem into the
          hands of <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#MurrayJohn">Murry</ref>. If he too
          says the same, good bye fine prospects!’ (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.344.html">Letter
            344</ref>, 17 September 1819). Despite the influence of Bloomfield’s old literary friends, John Murray (publisher of Byron and Thomas
          Moore) did not bite, and nothing from Bloomfield’s pen appeared in 1819, 1820 or 1821.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The
            publication of Crabbe’s <title>Tales of the Hall</title> in 1819, for which he was paid £3,000 by Murray, may have prompted Bloomfield to
            make this approach (see <ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.340.html">Letter 340</ref>, 3
            September 1819) and may also partly explain his decision to change the title of the work from ‘Oakly Hall’ to <title>May-Day with the
              Muses</title>.</note></p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">It was at the nadir of Bloomfield’s fortunes that one of his old gentlemen friends got in touch with
          him again. <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LloydBakerThomasJ">Thomas Lloyd
            Baker</ref>, a wealthy Gloucestershire landowner, wrote in 1821, sending a banknote, but also presuming on their past membership of a
          companionate circle centered on his wife and her sisters to lecture Bloomfield about his conduct:</p>

        <quote>It has been remarked that for some time past neither yourself nor any of your family have been in the habit of attending any place of
          worship whatsoever. It has also been observed that you are in the habit of reading some periodical works which are very hostile to the
          government of this country. Perhaps from these two circumstances coupled together has originated the idea that you have imbibed both
          Deistical &amp; Republican principles. The latter tending to the subversion of that Government under which we have all lived so long free
          from those calamities which have befallen almost every other part of Europe—The former tending to the destruction of Christianity, &amp;
          herein of every thing most valuable to us all (but most of all endangering the eternal welfare of those who are unhappy enough to become its
          Dupes) and both being so frequently united in the same persons—These considerations have induced many of your friends &amp; patrons upon
          principle to withhold from you their accustomed protection &amp; assistance, thinking that by doing as they had done, &amp; as they still
          wish to do, they should be giving countenance to a dangerous man. I cannot think they are right. I cannot adopt such an opinion of you. In
          full hope that all maybe explained away, &amp; that you may again stand as high in the esteem of your friends as the religious and moral
          tendency of your former life &amp; works had placed you, I take advantage of being in your neighbourhood to give you this information, &amp;
          to assure you that I shall have much pleasure in making known to your former friends any answer to this letter which you may think it right
          to favor me with for this purpose. (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.351.html">Letter
            351</ref>, 23 May 1821)</quote>

        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The letter is one example of the ideological strife of post-Waterloo Britain: it places in stark
          illumination the repression by which the ruling classes maintained their grip on power, all the while fearing revolution. Bloomfield knew he
          was now living through a reactionary era, in which the classes were polarised, and his public response was to create, in his final
          collection of poems <title>May-Day with the Muses</title> (1822), a pastoral fantasy wherein the literary circle once offered him by
          literary gentlemen and women—<ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LofftCapel"

          with Baldwin, Cradock and Joy. Writing to Baldwin on 5 June (<ref
            target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.355.html">Letter 355</ref>), Bloomfield made plain his
          financial plight, and the reduced worth of his poetry. He noted that Baldwin had been uninterested in buying a share of the copyright, not
          wanting to risk the firm’s money on the publication: this was not the arrangement that had operated for <title>The Farmer’s Boy</title>,
            <title>Rural Tales</title>, and <title>Wild Flowers</title>. He needed money so badly that he asked Baldwin for a loan, to be repaid in
          instalments from future sales receipts: effectively giving up, in all but name, a quarter of his copyright. Baldwin agreed to this, and to a
          later request to buy a further quarter, for which Bloomfield received £100. In spring 1822 a first edition of a thousand copies was
          published, priced at two shillings and sixpence (3000 had been printed for both the first and second editions of <title>Wild
          Flowers</title>). A second edition, in duodecimo at four shillings, also of a thousand copies, appeared later in the year—but this was not
          enough to redeem Bloomfield’s fortunes. He was a poor man when he died the following summer, dying so indebted that his family had to hold,
          in their home village, a public sale of his books and household goods.</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0"><title>May-Day</title> is a collection set in a village in which poetry is able to substitute for money
          and rent can be paid in verse. Built on a conceit, it is ostensibly the fruit of a poetry slam organized to celebrate the traditional May
          Day festivities. The local squire, Sir Ambrose Higham, Bloomfield imagines, invites the villagers to recite poems about village life,
          accepting them in lieu of rent. Thus the landowner renews old customs, preferring poetry to money as a sign of value, and patronizes, in the
          best sense, rustics who are able to voice their rural experience as verse. The squire respects his tenants and they him: the ideal village,
          for Bloomfield, is self-policing. This was an old-fashioned and forlorn hope, perhaps, in face of the capitalization of farming and the
          coerciveness of squires such as Lloyd Baker, but it was one to which Wordsworth, Southey, and Gilpin also subscribed as did Cobbett: despite
          their political differences, their common commitment to the superiority of the remembered rural society of their youth over the capitalist
          one of the present led them all to romanticize a rural paternalism that was both radical and conservative in its opposition to the liberal,
          laissez faire ideology of ‘improvement’ that enriched the landowning classes while impoverishing their labourers.</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Comprising ballads and lyrics, <title>May-Day</title> is effectively a conservative revisiting of
            <title>Rural Tales</title> and <title>Lyrical Ballads</title>, with a frame narrative that, like <ref type="m"
            target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth’s</ref> Preface (which
          Bloomfield had admired in 1802), was designed to outline the poems’ social import and to prepare for their proper reception by the reader.
          Wordsworth himself had embarked on a conservative reworking of the radical <title>Lyrical Ballads</title> in his ‘Song at the Feast of
          Brougham Castle’ (1807), in which the poet is imagined as a having the valued role of a bard singing of the deeds of the local Lord Clifford
          in the presence of that lord, his retainers, and tenants. In <title>May-Day</title> not only does it seem that to be a rural poet is to be a
          cherished villager and vice versa, but also that poetry is a face-to-face oral activity of a united community. The benevolent squire,
          moreover, respects tradition and exacts no political toll for his benevolence, which he in fact regards as his duty. Meanwhile, the
          individual poems that the villagers recite also tell of a traditional society in which authority is vested, at local level, in the community
          at large, presided over by a single figure who can therefore be addressed, appealed to, and even, potentially, rebuked and chastised face to
          face—the squire.</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The community at large is invoked in ‘The Drunken Father’, a comic tale narrating a potentially tragic
          story of paternal neglect. The poem evokes ‘The Idiot Boy’ because it features a mother worrying about her young child, out on an errand at
          night. As in that poem, the errand is a comic journey that might have been tragic—the child rescues his drunken father from the alehouse and
          navigates him safely home in the dark. The mother is relieved; her emotion, however, is the center of the drama. Domestic harmony is
          endorsed; the father agrees to reform and become, in the eyes of the villagers, an upstanding family man. If this ending imagines the
          village as being largely free of exploitation and mostly capable of healing its own social ills, then ‘The Forester’ offers a more critical
          view, implicitly endorsing a radical politics of nature. Bloomfield has his narrator use the oak-tree motif that had served to legitimize
          the monarchy since the time of Charles II. A mighty oak in the squire’s park has fallen:</p>

        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent5">(lines 45–72)<note place="foot" resp="editors"> This poem was almost certainly prompted by a
            letter Bloomfield received from his patron, the <ref type="m"
              target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#GraftonGeorgeHenry4">4th Duke of Grafton</ref>, who
            wrote to express his regrets that ‘Mr. B’s muse should have been so long silent’, and mentioned ‘an occurrence such as was witnessed by
            several persons in a neighbouring forest (Salcey), [which] might have roused her from her lethargy, if she had been within reach of
            surveying the remains of the largest oak in the forest, which fell with a prodigious crash, a few days ago, within a hundred yards of the
            principal lodge, of which it had been for an age the chief ornament; the noise attracted the notice of all, but of none more than the
            forest deer, which assembled &amp; remained for some hours around it, as if to perform the funeral obsequies of a departed &amp; reverend
            friend; at last, they seemed mournfully to retire, their movements being silent and slow’ (10 February 1817, <ref
              target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.308.html">Letter 308</ref>).</note></p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The astonished deer, keen to ‘learn and muse’ what the unexpected change means, stand in for the local
          rustics. They also prompt an act of political interpretation by the narrator: he reminds his audience—and us, the readers—that monarchs,
          however mighty, are dependent on the people. There is a hint of Jacobinism about this lesson; the royal oak can represent a ‘bigot’ as well
          as a ‘sage’ king, and bigots can be swept away. The political resonances of this passage were picked up on by the reviewer for
            <title>Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine </title>(vol. 11, no. 55 (June 1822), 722–31), who noted that the poem’s speaker ‘seems somewhat
          radically disposed’, and added: ‘We presume from the opinions of his Keeper, that old Sir Ambrose Higham was a Whig, and voted with the
          majority.’ The poem concludes not with a patriotic declaration of loyalty to king and country, but by imagining nature as a levelling
          principle that guarantees individual liberty:</p>

        </lg>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent5">(lines 89–96)</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Bloomfield’s position here is close to that of Wordsworth in 1798: the wilds and forests are a reliable
          refuge and resource for revolutionary freedom, at least for the individual poet if not for the masses. Cowper’s rural radicalism stands
          behind both writers, and Bloomfield honours it by borrowing the oak-tree symbol through which Cowper had most searchingly interrogated
          power.</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The next poem, ‘The Shepherd’s Dream: or, Fairies’ Masquerade’, was arguably even more contentious.
          This was read, in spite of Bloomfield’s description of it as ‘a lay, / Harmless and wild and fitting for the day’ (lines 23–4), as a parable
          on the recent wars with France. As the <title>Monthly Review</title> (99 (1822), 89–94) succinctly put it: ‘The shepherd now repeats a very
          fanciful dream, which is in fact an allegorical description of the French Revolution and the great political events that have followed it.’
          Critical opinion on this poem was mixed. <title>The Literary Gazette, and Journal of Belles Lettres, Arts, Sciences, &amp;c. </title>(277
          (11 May 1822), 289–91) dismissed it as ‘a sort of allegorical account of Buonaparte’s last campaigns; and furnishes no extract we could wish
          to adduce’, while <title>The Literary Speculum</title> (2 (1822), 1–12) stated that ‘the political allusion’ to Napoleon’s fate ‘might have
          been spared, as it is out of place’. As above, the review in <title>Blackwood’s</title> is enlightening. ‘The old shepherd’, it admitted, is
          ‘beautifully introduced’, but the poem itself was a more difficult proposition. ‘It must have puzzled the audience not a little’, claimed
          the reviewer, ‘and on the first reading it was to us an enigma’:</p>

        <quote>It is no less an affair than a poetical summary of some of the principal events in the later parts of Napoleon’s life—the Russian
          expedition—his subsequent campaigns, his banishment to Elba—return to Paris—Waterloo—and St Helena.—It will be remembered, that Mr
          Bloomfield was the protegé of Capel Loft [<hi rend="ital">sic</hi>], a gentleman who believed with Sir Richard Phillips, that Napoleon was a
          man of pacific disposition, fond of home-comforts, and an empassioned lover of freedom. It is laughable to observe honest Robert Bloomfield
          adopting such insane absurdities: but the poem, notwithstanding, is excellent.</quote>

        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Within <title>May-Day</title> as a whole, however, radical statements are few, and most reviewers did
          not regard the collection as being jacobinical so much as sentimental. ‘Alfred and Jennet’, a ‘father’s tale’ about his daughter’s first
          love for a local youth who is blind, and written in the couplet form of The Farmer’s Boy, won many plaudits.<note place="foot"
            resp="editors"> The longest poem in the book, ‘Alfred and Jennet’ was probably the earliest written. ‘I long to be at home to finish <hi
              rend="ital">Jennet</hi> &amp;c.’, Bloomfield informed his wife in May 1813, ‘for I am determined to get more money for my rhymes’ (<ref
              target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.282.html">Letter 282</ref>).</note><title>The Eclectic
            Review</title> (NS 27 (1822), 548–51) thought it the ‘best thing in the volume’ but, in a sign of the times, felt it necessary to make a
          case for Bloomfield, neglected as he now was:</p>

        <quote><hi rend="smcaps">Few</hi> poets have more honestly won, or more meekly worn their honours than Robert Bloomfield. That he is a poet,
          we will maintain in the face of all critics Northern and Southern, who would insinuate to the contrary. Had he been so fortunate as to come
          into the world fifty years earlier, no one would have thought of depreciating his claims. But the literary world has been of late pampered
          into daintiness. The Farmer’s Boy was too <hi rend="ital">loftily</hi> bepraised at its first appearance. It owed, it is true, much of its
          temporary success to the well-meant endeavours of its Editor and Commentator; and so far the Poet was under great obligations to his
          Maecenas. But the ebb-tide of popular feeling has fallen proportionably below the mark, and has left the poet scarcely afloat.</quote>
        <quote>It has been brought as a heavy and annihilating charge against Bloomfield, that he is not either <ref type="m"
            target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BurnsRobert">Burns</ref> or <ref type="m"
            target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#ClareJohn">Clare</ref>. To compare him with the former,
          were absurd, for Burns was not an uneducated man; and it were not less invidious to set up young Lubin to the disparagement of old Giles.
          But, as such a comparison has been hinted at, we will just take the liberty to remark, that had Giles been left to follow the plough,
          instead of stooping over the last in Bell Alley, or vegetating at the Shepherd and Shepherdess in the City Road,—had he remained a peasant
          and a pupil of Nature till his limbs had acquired their full development, his frame had been strung to health, and his education as a poet
          had been completed by the woods and the streams, the winds and the sunshine, and the quiet of the country, our Farmer’s Boy would have led
          off with the Muses on May-day in a far higher style than must now be expected from him. The man has brain enough, as his ample forehead
          testifies. The ‘anterior cerebral lobes,’ as Mr. Lawrence would say, are sufficiently developed to admit of his excelling as a poet. And he
          has certainly heart enough, for never was a more passionate lover of rural Nature. All that seems wanted is, a greater portion of physical
          elasticity, that should have given a healthful vigour to his thoughts, and tone to his feelings. The feebleness which is occasionally
          betrayed in his productions, is that induced by the languid action of a crazy frame, originally unworthy of the mind which it serves, and
          rendered still more inadequate to the higher functions of imagination by perpetual ill-health and concomitant anxieties, ‘I have written
          these tales,’ he tells us, ‘in anxiety and in a wretched state of health; and if these formidable foes have not incapacitated me, but left
          me free to meet the public eye with any degree of credit, that degree of credit I am sure I shall gain.’ They have not incapacitated him for
          pleasing those who are disposed to be pleased with wild-flowers and May-blossom, and such simple things as go to form a May-day wreath; and
          he must be a ruthless and a heartless critic who would by rough handling doom them to fade a moment before their time.</quote>

        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">This was special pleading. Readers are asked to look kindly on the poems because they pity Bloomfield’s
          disability and recognise the difficult circumstances in which he had learned to write: condescension is sought because admiration is not to
          be expected. Bloomfield’s vogue has given way to the fashion for Clare, the new ‘peasant poet’ (who, ironically enough, was influenced by
          Bloomfield not simply as an example of a labourer poet but as a craftsman in verse).</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The <title>Monthly Review</title>, reviewing the second edition, also acknowledged Bloomfield’s
          ‘yesterday’s man’ status, but offered a more robust endorsement of his powers, though suggesting, between the lines, that his rural tales
          were good because they ignored the realities of pain and poverty that other poets confronted: </p>

        <quote><hi rend="smcaps">While</hi> in Italy we find poets and scholars assuming the character of shepherds, and emulously enrolling
          themselves among <hi rend="ital">Gli Arcadi</hi>, in England our villagers and yeomen not unfrequently exchange the plough for the lyre, and
          the pruning-hook for the pen. Of the two metamorphoses, undoubtedly the latter is the most natural and rational; and it is an honorable
          proof of the extensive influence which our free institutions exert over our habits and feelings, that our literary history affords so many
          instances of eminent authors who have risen to such celebrity from the lowest situations. This is as it should be in the ‘Republic of
          Letters,’ where genius and talent are the only title to superior distinction.—The English public have always recognized the claims of merit,
          however nameless and humble; and among those who have been raised from their obscurity by the public approbation and encouragement, no one
          has deserved his elevation more justly than Robert Bloomfield.</quote>
        <quote>As the author of ‘The Farmer’s Boy,’ this votary of the Muses has long been a favorite with those whose feelings are calm and healthy
          enough to be delighted with poetry, which borrows its only charm from the innocence and simplicity of rural occupations, and the exhibition
          of homely affections. In these quiet and unobtrusive descriptions, no writer has been happier than Bloomfield. Unlike Crabbe, who is always
          most successful when he is painting some scene of wretchedness or knavery,—a young girl breaking her heart at the faithlessness of her
          lover, or a parish-apprentice cheating the overseers,—Bloomfield delights to describe the virtues and happiness of rural life, and thus
          affords us most certainly a more pleasant and more satisfactory picture. We rejoice, therefore, to find him once more appearing before the
          public; giving a proof not only that he is not dead, but that he has not forgotten how to weave together his village rhymes as pleasingly as
          heretofore. </quote>

        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Noting that there were several poems in Bloomfield’s best, ballad style, there were also some in which
          ‘we observe a straining to reach a higher tone of feeling than is natural to the poet’, the reviewer concluded by ‘assuring our readers that
          they will not find many pleasanter modes of whiling away a gloomy afternoon in Autumn than in the perusal of May-Day with the Muses.’ This
          was to offer modest, if not faint, praise.</p>

        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The word ‘fancy’ connects itself with my very childhood, fifty years back. The fancy of those who wrote
          the songs which I was obliged to hear in infancy was a very inanimate and sleepy fancy. I could enumerate a dozen songs at least which all
          described sleeping shepherds and shepherdesses, and, in one instance, where they both went to sleep: this is not fair certainly; it is not
          even ‘watch and watch.’</p>
