               <div class="indent4">My untried muse shall no high tone assume,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Nor strut in arms;—farewell my cap and plume: </div>
               <div class="indent4">Brief be my verse, a task within my power,</div>
               <div class="indent4">I tell my feelings in one happy hour;</div>
               <div class="indent4">But what an hour was that! when from the main<span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">I reach’d this lovely valley once again!</div>
               <div class="indent4">A glorious harvest fill’d my eager sight, </div>
               <div class="indent4">Half shock’d, half waving in a flood of light;</div>
               <div class="indent4">On that poor cottage roof where I was born</div>
               <div class="indent4">The sun look’d down as in life’s early morn.<span class="lineNumber">10</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">I gazed around, but not a soul appear’d,</div>
               <div class="indent4">I listen’d on the threshold, nothing heard; </div>
               <div class="indent4">I call’d my father thrice, but no one came;</div>
               <div class="indent4">It was not fear or grief that shook my frame,</div>
               <div class="indent4">But an o’erpowering sense of peace and home,<span class="lineNumber">15</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Of toils gone by, perhaps of joys to come.</div>
               <div class="indent4">The door invitingly stood open wide, </div>
               <div class="indent4">I shook my dust, and set my staff aside.</div>
               <div class="indent4">How sweet it was to breathe that cooler air,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And take possession of my father’s chair!<span class="lineNumber">20</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Beneath my elbow, on the solid frame,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Appear’d the rough initials of my name, </div>
               <div class="indent4">Cut forty years before!—the same old clock</div>
               <div class="indent4">Struck the same bell, and gave my heart a shock</div>
               <div class="indent4">I never can forget. A short breeze sprung,<span class="lineNumber">25</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">And while a sigh was trembling on my tongue,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Caught the old dangling almanacks behind, </div>
               <div class="indent4">And up they flew, like banners in the wind;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Then gently, singly, down, down, down, they went,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And told of twenty years that I had spent<span class="lineNumber">30</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Far from my native land:—that instant came</div>
               <div class="indent4">A robin on the threshold; though so tame, </div>
               <div class="indent4">At first he look’d distrustful, almost shy,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And cast on me his coal-black stedfast eye,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And seem’d to say (past friendship to renew)<span class="lineNumber">35</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">‘Ah ha! old worn-out soldier, is it you?’</div>
               <div class="indent4">Through the room ranged the imprison’d humble bee, </div>
               <div class="indent4">And bomb’d, and bounced, and struggled to be free,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Dashing against the panes with sullen roar,</div>
               <div class="indent4">That threw their diamond sunlight on the floor;<span class="lineNumber">40</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">That floor, clean sanded, where my fancy stray’d</div>
               <div class="indent4">O’er undulating waves the broom had made, </div>
               <div class="indent4">Reminding me of those of hideous forms</div>
               <div class="indent4">That met us as we pass’d the <span class="ital">Cape of Storms</span>,

               <div class="indent4">Where high and loud they break, and peace comes never;<span class="lineNumber">45</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">They roll and foam, and roll and foam for ever.</div>
               <div class="indent4">But <span class="ital">here </span>was peace, that peace which home can yield;</div>
               <div class="indent4">The grasshopper, the partridge in the field,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And ticking clock, were all at once become</div>
               <div class="indent4">The substitutes for clarion, fife, and drum.<span class="lineNumber">50</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">While thus I mused, still gazing, gazing still</div>
               <div class="indent4">On beds of moss that spread the window sill, </div>
               <div class="indent4">I deem’d no moss my eyes had ever seen</div>
               <div class="indent4">Had been so lovely, brilliant, fresh, and green,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And guess’d some infant hand had placed it there,<span class="lineNumber">55</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">And prized its hue, so exquisite, so rare.</div>
               <div class="indent4">Feelings on feelings mingling, doubling rose, </div>
               <div class="indent4">My heart felt every thing but calm repose;</div>
               <div class="indent4">I could not reckon minutes, hours, nor years,</div>
               <div class="indent4">But rose at once, and bursted into tears;<span class="lineNumber">60</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Then, like a fool, confused, sat down again,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And thought upon the past with shame and pain; </div>
               <div class="indent4">I raved at war and all its horrid cost,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And glory’s quagmire, where the brave are lost.</div>
               <div class="indent4">On carnage, fire, and plunder, long I mused,<span class="lineNumber">65</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">And cursed the murdering weapons I had used.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="indent4">Two shadows then I saw, two voices heard, </div>
               <div class="indent4">One bespoke age, and one a child’s appear’d.—</div>
               <div class="indent4">In stepp’d my father with convulsive start,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And in an instant clasp’d me to his heart.<span class="lineNumber">70</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Close by him stood a little blue-eyed maid,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And, stooping to the child, the old man said, </div>
               <div class="indent4">‘Come hither, Nancy, kiss me once again,</div>
               <div class="indent4">This is your uncle Charles, come home from Spain.’</div>
               <div class="indent4">The child approach’d, and with her fingers light,<span class="lineNumber">75</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Stroked my old eyes, almost deprived of sight.—</div>
               <div class="indent4">But why thus spin my tale, thus tedious be? </div>
               <div class="indent4">Happy old Soldier! what’s the world to me?</div>

               <div class="indent4">It acts instinctively, it will be fed.</div>
               <div class="indent4">A troop of country lasses paced the green,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Tired of their seats, and anxious to be seen;</div>
               <div class="indent4">They pass’d Sir Ambrose, turn’d, and pass’d again, </div>

               <div class="indent4">Who of fourscore, or fifty score, would not?</div>
               <div class="indent4">He wink’d, he nodded, and then raised his hand,—</div>
               <div class="indent4">’Twas seen and answer’d by the Oakly band.</div>
               <div class="indent4">Forth leap’d the light of heart and light of heel, </div>
               <div class="indent4">E’en stiff limb’d age the kindling joy could feel.<span class="lineNumber">20</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">They form’d, while yet the music started light;</div>
               <div class="indent4">The grass beneath their feet was short and bright,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Where thirty couple danced with all their might.</div>
               <div class="indent4">The Forester caught lasses one by one, </div>
               <div class="indent4">And twirl’d his glossy green against the sun;<span class="lineNumber">25</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">The Shepherd threw his doublet on the ground,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And clapp’d his hands, and many a partner found:</div>
               <div class="indent4">His hat-loops bursted in the jocund fray,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And floated o’er his head like blooming May. </div>

               <div class="indent4">And threading all the mazes of the crowd;</div>
               <div class="indent4">And had he boasted one had wagg’d his tail,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And plainly said, ‘What can my master ail?’</div>
               <div class="indent4">To which the Shepherd, had he been more cool, </div>

               <div class="indent4">He sat beside his own sick Rosamond, </div>
               <div class="indent4">Whose illness long deferr’d their wedding hour;<span class="lineNumber">40</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">She wept, and seem’d a lily in a shower;</div>

               <div class="indent4">With joy, with love, and hope by Heaven bestow’d.</div>
               <div class="indent4">He woo’d, he soothed, and every art assay’d,<span class="lineNumber">50</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">To hush the scruples of the bashful maid,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Drawing, at length, against her weak command,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Reluctantly the treasure from her hand:</div>
               <div class="indent4">And would have read, but passion chain’d his tongue, </div>
               <div class="indent4">He turn’d aside, and down the ballad flung;<span class="lineNumber">55</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">And paused so long from feeling and from shame,</div>
               <div class="indent4">That old Sir Ambrose halloo’d him by name:</div>
               <div class="indent4">‘Bring it to me, my lad, and never fear,</div>
               <div class="indent4">I never blamed true love, or scorn’d a tear;</div>
               <div class="indent4">They well become us, e’en where branded most.’<span class="lineNumber">60</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">He came, and made a proxy of his host,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Who, as the dancers cooling join’d the throng,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Eyed the fair writer as he read her song.</div>
