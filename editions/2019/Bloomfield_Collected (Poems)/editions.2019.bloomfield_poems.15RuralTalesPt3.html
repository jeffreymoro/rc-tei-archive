            </header>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="indent4">BRIGHT was the summer sky, the Mornings gay, </div>
               <div class="indent4">And <span class="smcaps">Jane</span> was young and chearful as the Day.</div>
               <div class="indent4">Not yet to Love but Mirth she paid her vows; </div>
               <div class="indent4">And Echo mock’d her as she call’d her Cows. </div>
               <div class="indent4">Tufts of green Broom, that full in blossom vied, <span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">And grac’d with spotted gold the upland side, </div>
               <div class="indent4">The level fogs o’erlook’d; too high to share; </div>
               <div class="indent4">So lovely <span class="smcaps">Jane</span> o’erlook’d the clouds of Care;</div>
               <div class="indent4">No meadow-flow’r rose fresher to the view, </div>
               <div class="indent4">That met her morning footsteps in the dew; <span class="lineNumber">10</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Where, if a nodding stranger ey’d her charms, </div>
               <div class="indent4">The blush of innocence was up in arms, </div>
               <div class="indent4">Love’s random glances struck the unguarded mind, </div>
               <div class="indent4">And Beauty’s magic made him look behind.</div>
               <div class="indent5">Duly as morning blush’d or twilight came,<span class="lineNumber">15</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Secure of greeting smiles and Village fame, </div>
               <div class="indent4">She pass’d the Straw-roof’d Shed, in ranges where </div>
               <div class="indent4">Hung many a well-turn’d Shoe and glitt’ring <span class="ital">Share</span>;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Where <span class="smcaps">Walter</span>, as the charmer tripp’d along,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Would stop his roaring Bellows and his Song.— <span class="lineNumber">20</span></div>
               <div class="indent5">Dawn of affection; Love’s delicious sigh! </div>
               <div class="indent4">Caught from the lightnings of a speaking eye, </div>
               <div class="indent4">That leads the heart to rapture or to woe, </div>
               <div class="indent4">’Twas <span class="smcaps">Walter’s</span> fate thy mad’ning power to know;</div>
               <div class="indent4">And scarce to know, ere in its infant twine, <span class="lineNumber">25</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">As the Blast shakes the tendrils of the Vine,</div>
               <div class="indent4">The budding bliss that full of promise grew </div>
               <div class="indent4">The chilling blight of separation knew. </div>
               <div class="indent4">Scarce had he told his heart’s unquiet case, </div>
               <div class="indent4">And <span class="smcaps">Jane</span> to shun him ceas’d to mend her pace,<span class="lineNumber">30</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">And learnt to listen trembling as he spoke, </div>
               <div class="indent4">And fondly judge his words beyond a joke; </div>
               <div class="indent4">When, at the Goal that bounds our prospects here,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Jane’s widow’d Mistress ended her career:</div>
               <div class="indent4">Blessings attended her divided store,<span class="lineNumber">35</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">The Mansion sold, (Jane’s peaceful home no more,)</div>
               <div class="indent4">A distant Village own’d her for its Queen,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Another service, and another scene;</div>
               <div class="indent4">But could another scene so pleasing prove,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Twelve weary miles from Walter and from Love?<span class="lineNumber">40</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">The Maid grew thoughtful: yet to Fate resign’d,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Knew not the worth of what she left behind.</div>
               <div class="indent5">He, when at Eve releas’d from toil and heat, </div>
               <div class="indent4">Soon miss’d the smiles that taught his heart to beat,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Each sabbath-day of late was wont to prove <span class="lineNumber">45</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Hope’s liberal feast, the holiday of Love: </div>
               <div class="indent4">But now, upon his spirit’s ebbing strength </div>
               <div class="indent4">Came each dull hour’s intolerable length. </div>
               <div class="indent4">The next had scarcely dawn’d when Walter hied </div>
               <div class="indent4">O’er hill and dale, Affection for his guide: <span class="lineNumber">50</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">O’er the brown Heath his pathless journey lay, </div>
               <div class="indent4">Where screaming Lapwings hail’d the op’ning day. </div>
               <div class="indent4">High rose the Sun, the anxious Lover sigh’d; </div>
               <div class="indent4">His slipp’ry soles bespoke the dew was dried: </div>
               <div class="indent4">Her last farewell hung fondly on his tongue <span class="lineNumber">55</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">As o’er the tufted Furze elate he sprung; </div>
               <div class="indent4">Trifling impediments; his heart was light, </div>
               <div class="indent4">For Love and Beauty glow’d in fancy’s sight; </div>
               <div class="indent4">And soon he gaz’d on Jane’s enchanting face, </div>
               <div class="indent4">Renew’d his passion,—but, destroy’d his peace. <span class="lineNumber">60</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Truth, at whose shrine he bow’d, inflicted pain; </div>
               <div class="indent4">And Conscience whisper’d, ‘<span class="ital">never come again.</span>’</div>
               <div class="indent4">For now, his tide of gladness to oppose,</div>
               <div class="indent4">A clay-cold damp of doubts and fears arose;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Clouds, which involve, midst Love and Reason’s strife,<span class="lineNumber">65</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">The poor man’s prospect when he takes a wife.</div>
               <div class="indent4">Though gay his journeys in the Summer’s prime,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Each seem’d the repetition of a crime;</div>
               <div class="indent4">He never left her but with many a sigh,</div>
               <div class="indent4">When tears stole down his face, she knew not why.<span class="lineNumber">70</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Severe his task those visits to forego,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And feed his heart with voluntary woe.</div>
               <div class="indent4">Yet this he did; the wan Moon circling found</div>
               <div class="indent4">His evenings cheerless, and his rest unsound;</div>
               <div class="indent4">And saw th’ unquenched flame his bosom swell:<span class="lineNumber">75</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">What were his doubts, thus let the Story tell.</div>
               <div class="indent5">A month’s sharp conflict only serv’d to prove </div>
               <div class="indent4">The pow’r, as well as truth, of Walter’s love. </div>
               <div class="indent4">Absence more strongly on his mind portray’d </div>
               <div class="indent4">His own sweet, injur’d, unoffending Maid.<span class="lineNumber">80</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Once more he’d go; full resolute awhile, </div>
               <div class="indent4">But heard his native Bells on every stile; </div>
               <div class="indent4">The sound recall’d him with a pow’rful charm, </div>
               <div class="indent4">The Heath wide open’d, and the day was warm; </div>
               <div class="indent4">There, where a bed of tempting green he found, <span class="lineNumber">85</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Increasing anguish weigh’d him to the ground; </div>
               <div class="indent4">His well-grown limbs the scatter’d Daisies press’d, </div>
               <div class="indent4">While his clinch’d hand fell heavy on his breast.</div>
               <div class="indent5">‘Why do I go in cruel sport to say,</div>
               <div class="indent4">“I love thee, Jane; appoint the happy day?”<span class="lineNumber">90</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Why seek her sweet ingenuous reply, </div>
               <div class="indent4">Then grasp her hand and proffer—poverty?</div>
               <div class="indent4">Why, if I love her and adore her name,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Why act like time and sickness on her frame? </div>
               <div class="indent4">Why should my scanty pittance nip her prime,<span class="lineNumber">95</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">And chace away the Rose before its time?</div>
               <div class="indent4">I’m young, ’tis true; the world beholds me free;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Labour ne’er show’d a frightful face to me; </div>
               <div class="indent4">Nature’s first wants hard labour <span class="ital">should</span> supply;</div>
               <div class="indent4">But should it fail, ’twill be too late to fly.<span class="lineNumber">100</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Some Summers hence, if nought our loves annoy,</div>
               <div class="indent4">The image of my Jane may lisp her joy;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Or, blooming boys with imitative swing</div>
               <div class="indent4">May mock my arm, and make the Anvil ring;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Then if in rags.—But, O my heart, forbear,—<span class="lineNumber">105</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">I love the Girl, and why should I despair?</div>
               <div class="indent4">And that I love her all the village knows;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Oft from my pain the mirth of others flows;</div>
               <div class="indent4">As when a neighbour’s Steed with glancing eye</div>
               <div class="indent4">Saw his par’d hoof supported on my thigh:<span class="lineNumber">110</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Jane pass’d that instant; mischief came of course;</div>
               <div class="indent4">I drove the nail awry and lam’d the Horse;</div>
               <div class="indent4">The poor beast limp’d: I bore a Master’s frown,</div>
               <div class="indent4">A thousand times I wish’d the wound my own.</div>
               <div class="indent4">When to these tangling thoughts I’ve been resign’d,<span class="lineNumber">115</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Fury or languor has possess’d my mind,</div>
               <div class="indent4">All eyes have stared, I’ve blown a blast so strong;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Forgot to smite at all, or smote too long.</div>
               <div class="indent4">If at the Ale-house door, with careless glee </div>
               <div class="indent4">One drinks to Jane, and darts a look on me;<span class="lineNumber">120</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">I feel that blush which her dear name will bring, </div>
               <div class="indent4">I feel:—but, guilty Love, ’tis not thy sting!</div>
               <div class="indent4">Yet what are jeers? the bubbles of an hour;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Jane knows what Love can do, and feels its pow’r;</div>
               <div class="indent4">In her mild eye fair Truth her meaning tells;<span class="lineNumber">125</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">‘Tis not in looks like her’s that falsehood dwells.</div>
               <div class="indent4">As water shed upon a dusty way</div>
               <div class="indent4">I’ve seen midst downward pebbles devious stray;</div>
               <div class="indent4">If kindred drops an adverse channel keep,</div>
               <div class="indent4">The crystal friends toward each other creep;<span class="lineNumber">130</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Near, and still nearer, rolls each little tide,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Th’ expanding mirror swells on either side:</div>
               <div class="indent4">They touch—’tis done—receding bound’ries fly,</div>
               <div class="indent4">An instantaneous union strikes the eye:</div>
               <div class="indent4">So ’tis with us: for Jane would be my bride; <span class="lineNumber">135</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Shall coward fears then turn the bliss aside?’ </div>
               <div class="indent5">While thus he spoke he heard a gentle sound, </div>
               <div class="indent4">That seem’d a jarring footstep on the ground: </div>
               <div class="indent4">Asham’d of grief, he bade his eyes unclose, </div>
               <div class="indent4">And shook with agitation as he rose;<span class="lineNumber">140</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">All unprepared the sweet surprise to bear, </div>
               <div class="indent4">His heart beat high, for Jane herself was there.— </div>
               <div class="indent4">Flusht was her cheek; she seem’d the full-blown flower. </div>
               <div class="indent4">For warmth gave loveliness a double power; </div>
               <div class="indent4">Round her fair brow the deep confusion ran, <span class="lineNumber">145</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">A waving handkerchief became her fan, </div>
               <div class="indent4">Her lips, where dwelt sweet love and smiling ease, </div>
               <div class="indent4">Puff’d gently back the warm assailing breeze. </div>
               <div class="indent4">‘I’ve travell’d all these weary miles with pain, </div>
               <div class="indent4">To see my native village once again;<span class="lineNumber">150</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">And show my true regard for neighbour <span class="ital">Hind</span>;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Not like you, Walter, <span class="ital">she</span> was always kind.’</div>
               <div class="indent4">’Twas thus, each soft sensation laid aside,</div>
               <div class="indent4">She buoy’d her spirits up with maiden pride;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Disclaim’d her love, e’en while she felt the sting;<span class="lineNumber">155</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">‘What, come for Walter’s sake!’ ’Twas no such thing.</div>
               <div class="indent4">But when astonishment his tongue releas’d,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Pride’s usurpation in an instant ceas’d:</div>
               <div class="indent4">By force he caught her hand as passing by,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And gaz’d upon her half averted eye;<span class="lineNumber">160</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">His heart’s distraction, and his boding fears</div>
               <div class="indent4">She heard, and answer’d with a flood of tears;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Precious relief; sure friends that forward press</div>
               <div class="indent4">To tell the mind’s unspeakable distress.</div>
               <div class="indent5">Ye Youths, whom crimson’d health and genuine fire<span class="lineNumber">165</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Bear joyous on the wings of young desire,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Ye, who still bow to Love’s almighty sway,</div>
               <div class="indent4">What could true passion, what could Walter say?</div>
               <div class="indent4">Age, tell me true, nor shake your locks in vain,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Tread back your paths, and be in love again;<span class="lineNumber">170</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">In your young days did such a favouring hour </div>
               <div class="indent4">Show you the littleness of wealth and pow’r? </div>
               <div class="indent4">Advent’rous climbers of the Mountain’s brow, </div>
               <div class="indent4">While Love, their master, spreads his couch below— </div>
               <div class="indent4">‘My dearest Jane,’ the untaught Walter cried, <span class="lineNumber">175</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">As half repell’d he pleaded by her side; </div>
               <div class="indent4">‘My dearest Jane, think of me as you may’—</div>
               <div class="indent4">Thus—still unutter’d what he strove to say, </div>
               <div class="indent4">They breath’d in sighs the anguish of their minds, </div>
               <div class="indent4">And took the path that led to neighbour <span class="ital">Hind’s</span>.<span class="lineNumber">180</span></div>
               <div class="indent5">A secret joy the well-known roof inspir’d, </div>
               <div class="indent4">Small was its store, and little they desir’d; </div>
               <div class="indent4">Jane dried her tears; while Walter forward flew </div>
               <div class="indent4">To aid the Dame; who to the brink updrew </div>
               <div class="indent4">The pond’rous Bucket as they reach’d the well, <span class="lineNumber">185</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">And scarcely with exhausted breath could tell </div>

               <div class="indent4">O’er whom she watch’d with a maternal care.</div>
               <div class="indent4">‘What ails thee, Jane?’ the wary Matron cried; </div>
               <div class="indent4">With heaving breast the modest Maid reply’d, <span class="lineNumber">190</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Now gently moving back her wooden Chair </div>
               <div class="indent4">To shun the current of the cooling air; </div>
               <div class="indent4">‘Not much, good Dame; I’m weary by the way; </div>
               <div class="indent4">Perhaps, anon, I’ve something else to say.’ </div>
               <div class="indent4">Now, while the Seed-cake crumbled on her knee, <span class="lineNumber">195</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">And Snowy Jasmine peeped in to see; </div>

               <div class="indent4">‘Jane has been weeping, Walter;—prithee why? </div>
               <div class="indent4">I’ve seen her laugh, and dance, but never cry.</div>
               <div class="indent4">But I can guess; with <span class="ital">her</span> you should have been,</div>

               <div class="indent4"><span class="smcaps">Jane</span> felt for <span class="smcaps">Walter</span>; felt his cruel pain,</div>

               <div class="indent4">The Dame resum’d—‘Why then, my Children, why </div>
               <div class="indent4">Do such young bosoms heave the piteous sigh? </div>
               <div class="indent4">The ills of Life to you are yet unknown; </div>
               <div class="indent4">Death’s sev’ring shaft, and Poverty’s cold frown: </div>

               <div class="indent4">Strong was my trust, and here I am at last. </div>
               <div class="indent4">When I dwelt young and cheerful down the <span class="ital">Lane</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">(And, though I say it, I was much like <span class="smcaps">Jane</span>,)</div>
               <div class="indent4">O’er flow’ry fields with <span class="ital">Hind,</span> I lov’d to stray,</div>

               <div class="indent4">And Care defied; who not one pain could give,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Till the thought came of how we were to live; </div>
               <div class="indent4">And then Love plied his arrows thicker still: </div>

               <div class="indent4">He died the other day: when round his bed</div>
               <div class="indent4">No tender soothing tear Affection shed—</div>

               <div class="indent5"><span class="smcaps">Walter</span> caught fire: nor was <span class="ital">he</span> charm’d alone</div>

               <div class="indent4">Her Lover took a more decided part:— <span class="lineNumber">235</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">(O! ’twas the very Chord that touch’d his heart,)— </div>
               <div class="indent4">Alive to the best feelings man can prize, </div>
               <div class="indent4">A Bridegroom’s transport sparkled in his eyes; </div>
               <div class="indent4">Love, conquering power, with unrestricted range </div>
               <div class="indent4">Silenc’d the arguments of Time and Change; <span class="lineNumber">240</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">And led his vot’ry on, and bade him view, </div>
               <div class="indent4">And prize the light-wing’d moments as they flew:</div>
               <div class="indent4">All doubts gave way, all retrospective lore, </div>

               <div class="indent4">Comparison of times, the Lab’rer’s hire, <span class="lineNumber">245</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">And many a truth Reflection might inspire, </div>
               <div class="indent4">Sunk powerless. ‘Dame, I am a fool,’ he cried; </div>

               <div class="indent4">While dastard fears withheld me from her sight,</div>

               <div class="indent4">First on the list of active Country ’Squires. </div>
               <div class="indent4">Seeing the youthful pair with downcast eyes, </div>

               <div class="indent4">Bearing with inward joy, and honest pride, </div>

               <div class="indent4">That consciousness of Worth, that freeborn Grace, </div>
               <div class="indent4">Which waits on Virtue in the meanest place.</div>

               <div class="indent4">The calm of Conscience, and the reign of Peace. </div>
               <div class="indent5">Walter’s enamour’d Soul, from news like this, </div>
