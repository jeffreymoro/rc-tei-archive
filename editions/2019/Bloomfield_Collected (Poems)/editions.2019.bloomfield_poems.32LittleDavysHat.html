            <p class="noCount">Bloomfield’s story for children looks at first like the cautionary tales of the new
               generation of children’s writers on which it is modelled. In the Preface to the second
               edition, he acknowledges Anna Laetitia Barbauld, Priscilla Wakefield, Maria Edgeworth
               and Sarah Trimmer, among others: these were the didactic, moralizing authors whose
               tales were disliked by Blake, Coleridge and other Romantic poets for equating goodness
               with prudential self-interest and imagination with improper license. While Coleridge
               pointedly preferred the old folk tale Jack the Giant Killer to this new, pious, conformist,
               middle-class and female literature, Bloomfield takes the opposite view. In the Preface
               he notes that his mother, the village schoolmistress, taught him ‘to prize “Goody
               Two Shoes” for its excellent hits at superstition; and to read the “History of Jack
               the Giant Killer” for the purpose of remarking its abominable absurdities’. He had,
               he declared ‘never found cause to alter this early opinion’, and he larded his story
               of a poor village boy given charity by the well-to-do daughter of a wealthy farmer
               with maxims designed to teach morality, or at least the kind of conduct that polite
               people regarded as a sign of respectability.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Despite its occasional primness, <em>The History of Little Davy’s New Hat</em>, does not, in the end, read like the tales of Trimmer and Barbauld, because Bloomfield
               is able, as they were not, to represent rural life from the point of view of the poor
               labourers. Instead of exhorting the poor to reform, or regarding them as victims to
               be pitied, Bloomfield displays an intimate knowledge of their culture—and in particular
               of the many expedients they use to sustain family life, and give a loving upbringing
               to their children, in face of want so extreme that the slightest accident—the loss
               of a hat, the breaking of a teapot—is a major problem. Their poverty is quietly shown
               to be a result neither of their fecklessness nor their laziness, but of economic changes
               that have driven small farmers out of business while benefitting wealthy landowners
               (the inflated price of corn during the wartime economy). A major theme is the effect
               of poverty on dress, and of this on family self-esteem: little Davy is painfully aware
               that, because his parents cannot afford a hat, he does not look respectable; his father
               will not go to church because he knows his ragged dress will be mocked by the better-off
               gamekeeper who is clothed by the squire who employs him. Independence and self-belief
               is shown to be increasingly precarious: the servants of the wealthy are the only villagers
               who flourish. Food is another theme: Bloomfield gives us a close-up view of shortage
               when Davy’s family cannot accept the gift of a puppy because unable to feed it and
               when Davy, visiting the wealthy farm, thinks the bone thrown to a dog by a kitchen
               maid would have served for a joint for his whole family. In face of this want, Davy’s
               elder brother has enlisted in a regiment going to the highly dangerous West Indies:
               villagers are fodder for cannon or tropical disease; his mother is worn down by the
               worry that she will never see him again.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The tale is not, in the end, a tragedy, or a work of social realism like <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a>’s ‘Last of the Flock’. It records poverty from the inside but it also indulges a
               wish-fulfilment fantasy. Because little Davy is charming and naïve he is taken up
               by the kindly Miss Wideland who relieves the worst of the family’s poverty. Class
               difference and economic self-interest is overcome by feminine and maternal tenderness
               for the innocent child, who is to her as the puppy is to him, a winning example of
               youthful life that deserves care. The puppy is named Pity, and the name is significant:
               Bloomfield displaces onto the animal the emotional dynamic on which his rosy vision
               of rural harmony in the human village relies. By doing so, he avoids the appearance
               of condescension and the recognition of improbability. Wealthy farmers’ daughters’
               acts of charity did not, as he knew from experience by 1815, successfully assuage
               poverty or restore harmony. Charitable donations involved demands for servile obedience
               to the ideology of the giver, as Bloomfield discovered in 1821 when the squire Thomas
               Lloyd Baker made a gift dependent upon Bloomfield’s going regularly to church and
               publicly disavowing radical politics (although he had never, in fact, avowed them).
               Parish relief, which Davy’s family also receives, in practice brought the likelihood
               of the workhouse.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Bloomfield wrote the tale in 1801 in London when the success of <em>The Farmer’s Boy </em>had lifted him and his extended family out of poverty and sweated labour; he published
               it in 1815, when living poverty-stricken in a Bedfordshire village to which he had
               retreated to reduce his expenses, his royalties having failed to provide for his own
               and his brothers’ families needs. <em>Little Davy</em>, that is, spoke of and was written from rural poverty: publication was an effort
               to stave off debts, just as, in the story, Mr Woodly goes to market to sell the brooms
               he has made, knowing his profits will be consumed by what he already owes. And if
               the story reflected Bloomfield’s own circumstances, it includes a Bloomfield figure:
               Grandfather Woodly is in poor health, as the author often was, and is a poet. He shows
               little Davy a ballad he has written (a ballad that Bloomfield had published in 1807:
               ‘The Butcher’s Horse and the Bees’). The story also includes another ballad, given
               by the kitchen maid to Davy’s mother as a broadside and sung at home. In this way
               it gives a rare glimpse as to how ballads and songs commonly circulated, in print
               and performance, among the rural population. Bloomfield’s ‘The Fakenham Ghost’ had
               itself been printed as a broadside and circulated in this manner.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The history of composition and publication is traceable in Bloomfield’s letters. On
               30 November 1801 he told his brother George that ‘My present amusement is writing
               a Child’s Book “the History of Little Davy’s new hat,” dedicated to my Mother’ (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.70.html">Letter 70</a>). On 31 January 1802 he sent the manuscript to <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BloomfieldGeorge">George</a>, for him to show to <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LofftCapel">Capel Lofft</a> (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.77.html">Letter 77</a>) and then wrote to his sister asking for ‘your opinion upon it, as to its language
               and construction, is it too silly, or only simple enough for a young reader?’ (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.78.html">Letter 78</a>; 31 January 1802). By 30 May 1802 he was happy enough with it to leave the manuscript
               at Devonshire House in Piccadilly, town house of the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire
               and social centre of the Whig party, including <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#FoxCharlesJames">Charles James Fox</a> who had admired <em>The Farmer’s Boy</em> (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.88.html">Letter 88</a>).</p>
            <p class="noCount">For reasons we do not know, Bloomfield then left the tale unpublished for thirteen
               years. Perhaps his dispute with Lofft over patronly interference in his works made
               him reluctant to go to press (although he published several collections of poems in
               this interval). In 1810 his interest in the story revived as he basked in the attention
               of the sisters of <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#SharpGranville">Granville Sharp</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#SharpCatherine">Catharine Sharp</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LloydBakerMary">Mary Lloyd Baker</a>. These friendly gentlewomen had invited him to accompany them on a tour of the river
               Wye in 1807; they acted as muses, fostering his verse by their friendly concern. A
               letter of 9–12 January 1810 (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.247.html">Letter 247</a>) reveals that he had sent the manuscript to both sisters, and received comments from
               them. Responding to these comments, Bloomfield clarifies his own view of the tale:</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">By way of amusement I remark thus <span class="ital">some</span> of your judicious observations, the rest are replied to in the paper to Catharine</blockquote>

            <p class="noCount">Lacking the sisters’ letters and the manuscript, we do not know whether Bloomfield
               revised the text at this point.</p>
            <p class="noCount">It was in 1812 that Bloomfield first made efforts to bring the story to press, motivated
               by the collapse of <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#VernorThomas">Vernor</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#HoodThomas">Hood</a> and the resultant sale at discount, within the publishing trade, of volumes from
               which he might have received royalties. On 24 October he told his daughter he had
               tried to sell the copyright of the tale to <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#CrosbyBenjamin">Crosby</a> (purchaser of part of the rights to his publications), without success (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.279.html">Letter 279</a>). Only in late 1815 did the story finally appear in print, published in a 2 shilling
               octavo by Darton, Harvey and Darton, who specialized in stories and instructional
               books for children and who also published Priscilla Wakefield. They were also the
               printers. Bloomfield was not named as author, but the initials R.B. were placed at
               the end of the Preface. He recorded receiving copies in a letter of 15–17 December
               (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.299.html">Letter 299</a>). Reviews were sparse but the<em>Eclectic Review </em>was complimentary, and wrote that ‘there are touches of nature in this <span class="ital">rural tale</span>, an artlessness of expression, and an air of intimacy with “the short and simple
               annals of the poor,” which sufficiently designate the author, whose initials, R. B.
               are affixed to the Preface: but the reader, to be pleased with it, must descend in
               feeling to the level of childhood and poverty, and fancy he is listening to the tones
               which had power in infancy to fix his attention to the most humble incidents of real
               life’ (NS 5 (1816), 76–77).</p>
            <p class="noCount">A second edition, which acknowledged Bloomfield’s authorship and was accompanied by
               a new preface, appeared in 1817, and a third in 1824.</p><br/><a id="davyshatpreface"><!--anchor--></a><p class="noCount">PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION</p>

            <p class="noCount"><span class="smcaps">Trifling</span> as the subject may appear to the young and the thoughtless, when a new book for children
               is introduced into a family it becomes the indispensable duty of parents, or their
               superintendents of the nursery, to know its contents. If it inculcates false principles,
               the pride of wealth, or, more particularly, superstition, let them, for mercy’s sake,
               use it for lighting the fire. This notion I imbibed forty years ago from my mother,
               a village school-mistress, and I have never found cause to alter this early opinion.
               It was then I was taught to prize ‘Goody Two Shoes’ for its excellent hits at superstition;
               and to read the ‘History of Jack the Giant Killer’ for the purpose of remarking its
               abominable absurdities.</p>
            <p class="noCount">In the year 1801 I wrote the following little story, for the purpose of trying its
               effects on the minds of my own children. I sunk the language to the level of their
               understandings, and succeeded beyond my expectation. After lying idle on my shelf
               for fourteen years, ‘<span class="smcaps">Davy</span>’ makes his appearance, to take his chance of pleasing more extensively. Perhaps the
               characters are too good—too perfect—for what we unfortunately see in real life; but
               that their poverty is not beyond truth, I am certain. The story is best adapted for
               village children; and will be most approved by those who promote good nature and charity.</p>

               its being noticed by the regular reviewers; for I live in a sequestered corner, not
               very accessible to literary intelligence. I find, however, that they have condescended
               to notice it, and the only fault which I have seen pointed out by them, I have endeavoured
               to correct in this second edition, and feel a pleasure in doing it.</p>
            <p class="noCount">In the first instance, I felt a reluctance to subscribing my name as its author; but
               have since discovered that such reluctance arose from a feeling of vanity, or some
               other feeling quite as unjustifiable. I really believe that reviewers are as well
               employed in overlooking and censuring these minor efforts of literature, intended
               for a rising generation, as in some of their more abstruse and metaphysical disquisitions,
               which the readers of this story, for instance, will not be able to understand for
               these thirty years to come.</p>

            <p class="noCount"><span class="smcaps">It</span> was very dark—not a star to be seen; the wind blew cold, and large drops were falling
               from the trees, when Miss Wideland, returning home in her chaise through a dark lane,
               met a little boy alone. The young lady was alarmed, and cried: ‘Who are you? What
               are you?’ A voice answered: ‘It is Davy, ma’am.’ ‘Why, you quite frightened me, Davy.
               What can you be doing here at this time of night?’ ‘I am but just come out,’ said
               Davy, ‘to meet my mother, who is coming home from the shop.’ At that moment, looking
               closely at the boy, the lady, with much concern, said: ‘Why, bless the child, you
               have no hat on!’ ‘No, ma’am,’ answered he; ‘but my father says he will buy me a hat
               soon.’ ‘Poor boy!’ said she very tenderly, and stooping down gave him sixpence, though
               she could hardly see his little white face in the dark. Then bidding him stand out
               of the way of the wheels, she drove home slowly, thinking about Davy all the way.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Now, though the boy did not ride home, he went as speedily and as lightly as if he
               had, and opening the door in great haste, did not stop to shut it (a fault which little
               boys are often guilty of), but ran to his father, who was sitting by the fire, and
               holding out his hand said, very loud, and with his eyes wide open with joy. ‘Father,
               I have got sixpence!’ This stopped his father from scolding him, as he deserved, for
               leaving the door open on a cold night. At that moment his mother returning, said:
               ‘What! in the name of patience, are you so hot as to sit with the door open? This
               is your doings, Davy.’ But here again he succeeded in stopping any further remarks
               on that subject, by saying: ‘Mother, Miss Wideland has given me sixpence!’ ‘Has she,
               indeed?’ said the good woman; ‘she was always a kind girl. She has given your poor
               brother <span class="smcaps">Will</span> many a sixpence, before he went for a soldier. She will never be the poorer for it,
               I know.’ ‘I don’t know about that,’ said Davy; ‘but I know that I have got it.’ And
               here he was just unbuttoning his pocket, when his father put some further questions
               to him, saying: ‘How came the young lady to see you, Davy? And what did she say to
               you?’ ‘Why,’ said he, ‘I was in the lane, and I believe she gave it to me because
               I had no hat, for she said “Poor boy!”‘ ‘Ay, poor boy indeed,’ said his father and
               mother, both at the same time; ‘but we will buy you one soon, Davy.’ ‘I told her so,
               father,’ said Davy; ‘and this sixpence, you know, will help to buy it.’</p>
            <p class="noCount">Davy’s father and mother were very poor; and so was old Master Woodly, his grandfather,
               who lived with them, and whose hair was as white as snow. They got their living by
               making birchbrooms; but his grandfather was very feeble, and his father seldom well
               long together, so that they could hardly get bread, with all they could do. His mother
               wore a petticoat that was mended with pieces which did not exactly match; but she
               did not mind that so long as it was whole. One end of the house they lived in had
               fallen down, for want of timely repairs; but they had plenty of room for their family.
               The ground rose so high behind the house that the upper end of the garden was nearly
               as high as the chimney, and the grandfather, who was a sensible old man, and remembered
               a great deal, was fond of sitting there in an old wicker chair which he had made in
               his youth. The sun would shine pleasantly here, even on a winter’s day, and the hill
               kept the cold off behind. Here Davy would set off his hoop, and it would run, of itself,
               down to the back-door, and sometimes through the house into the road.</p><br/><p class="noCount">CHAP. II.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Miss <span class="smcaps">Wideland’s</span> father was a farmer, and kept a great many horses and cows, and two flocks of sheep;
               and all the stock of hay and corn, the produce of five hundred acres of land, was
               his own. Both Mr. and Mrs. Wideland were esteemed good-natured and condescending to
               every one, but all the poor neighbours said that Miss Wideland was the best in the
               family; for she would often beg of her mother for the skimmed milk for them, when
               the dairy-maid dare not part with it, because it was wanted for the hogs. Whether
               it is quite right to give milk to pigs, while poor children go without, I will not
               say; but it happened one morning that Davy got up earlier than usual, and being very
               hungry, he longed for a dish of milk for breakfast, for he was very fond of it. His
               mother told him that she had been herself, the evening before, to Mr. Wideland’s,
               but could get none, the dairy-maid saying she must not sell it. ‘I wanted a little
               milk as well as you, Davy, to make a pudding, for I am not very well; but I must make
               shift without it.’ ‘Shall I go and try?’ said Davy. ‘You go, child! What good can
               you do by going?’ ‘Why,’ said Davy, ‘I think if I can see Miss Wideland, mother, I
               can get some milk.’ He set off directly, with a pitcher that would hold about three
               pints, and began to whistle as soon as he got out at the door.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The pasture-ground he had to cross was covered with shining dew-drops, and he found
               that his feet, brushing in the grass, left a mark or track behind him; he accordingly
               tried to walk exactly straight to a tree at the bottom of the field, and thereby make
               a kind of furrow, as he had seen the men do at plough. He had pleased himself with
               walking very straight a long way when a large turkey-cock, with his red head and a
               loud gobbling noise, attacked him and drove him out of his path. Davy had nothing
               to defend himself with but his pitcher. He was half angry and half frightened, and
               would certainly have thrown his hat at him if he had had one; but he was forced to
               run away as fast as he could. As he crossed the farm-yard to the dairy, he had to
               go just by the parlour window, where Miss Wideland used to sit, and she happened to
               be there that morning. When Davy saw that she looked at him, he made a handsome bow—one
               of his best. His face had been washed, and his flaxen hair combed, before he set out.
               He was a very pretty boy, and, what is much better, he was, upon the whole, a very
               good boy. ‘Well, Davy, what do you want?’ said she, though she could pretty well guess
               his errand by his pitcher. Davy only held up his pitcher, and answered, ‘Ma’am, I
               have had no breakfast.’ He was ordered into the dairy, where he not only had his pitcher
               filled, but the maid gave him a handful of cheese-curd to eat as he went home.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The magpie which was kept at Mr. Wideland’s could talk almost anything, and would
               hop after strangers, and sometimes peck their heels, especially those of girls who
               had holes in their stockings. Davy was delighted to hear the bird ask him, ‘What’s
               o’clock?’ and then say, ‘Quick, quick, Jack.’ To enjoy this prating bird’s company
               the better, Davy walked backwards down the yard, and by so doing struck his pitcher
               against a post. A blow a little harder would have broken it; but idle talk, like that
               of the magpie, will sometimes put wise people off their guard. However, when he had
               got into the field again he thought himself safe, for the turkey-cock was gone. But
               here, as he strolled along under the hedge, he saw a long straight bough of elder,
               which would make very excellent whistles. Though he wanted his breakfast, he could
               not help stopping to cut this tempting bough, which he could as well have obtained
               at any other time. Most little country boys carry a knife in their pockets, though
               they are seldom very sharp. He set down his pitcher in the grass, and had but just
               cut the bough down when he saw Mr. Wideland’s sow and pigs come trotting down towards
               him. They soon surrounded his pitcher, and he thought it was all over with his breakfast.
               He halloed to them, and made great haste to get down; but in his haste let go his
               hold, and fell headlong into the ditch. The rustling he made in his fall frightened
               the pigs, and saved his milk. He went home, thinking about these misfortunes, for
               boys and girls, as well as men and women, know when they have done wrong. It was wrong
               to loiter and make whistles when he should have carried his milk home; and Davy’s
               heart told him that it would have served him right to have lost his breakfast. However,
               he carried home his milk and his elder too. His mother was highly pleased to see the
               pitcher full; but Davy was ashamed to relate all that had happened, and therefore
               only mentioned the turkey-cock and the cheese-curd.</p><br/><p class="noCount">CHAP. III.</p>
            <p class="noCount">After breakfast, Davy reminded his mother that now he had put the sixpence Miss Wideland
               had given him into his box on the top of the cupboard, it made just seventeen-pence
               halfpenny; for he had been saving his money a long time to buy a hat. His mother heard
               him with a mixture of pleasure and pain; for she knew, though Davy did not, that his
               box was empty. She had been forced to borrow Davy’s money to make up enough to buy
               a loaf, for Mr. Snapgroat at the shop had trusted her a few shillings during the winter,
               and would not trust any more. But it being now the middle of March, she had strong
               hopes of paying him, and of doing better, when the weather grew fine. She did not
               much like the baker’s bread from the shop, but though she had an oven in her own house
               it was not always that she could get flour; and it was because all their money went
               for bread and flour that the boy went bareheaded.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Old Master Woodly had been round the home-close for a walk, and had brought home a
               whole handful of primroses. The sight of these flowers always gives poor people a
               hint that winter is going, and that the hardships they endure will be less and less
               every day; and so it proved with this family. Davy had been to school but little,
               but his grandfather used to teach him to read and spell. They were sitting together
               on the bench at the door, and Davy was trying to spell three syllables when they heard
               the gate open at the top of the hill, and saw Miss Wideland gently walking down to
               the door. As she approached the grandfather bowed, rising from his seat; but Davy
               bowed as soon as he saw her, and two or three times afterwards. Just as Miss Wideland
               came to the door, Davy’s sister Jane, about three years old, fell over the threshold,
               and her mother, in trying to save her, let fall a favourite tea-pot, which she had
               used many years. This was a bad misfortune on that account, but Mrs. Woodly was not
               one of those who are in the habit of making troubles out of trifles.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The child’s forehead was bruised, but her brother, who loved her dearly, had been
               used to nursing her, and could always quiet her sooner than her mother. When all was
               hushed again, Miss Wideland came in and sat down; and old Master Woodly, following
               her, also sat down in his elbow-chair, and was so pleased to see the good young lady
               call upon them that he almost forgot the rheumatism in his shoulder, which had troubled
               him all the morning. They thanked her over and over again for the kindness she had
               shown to them and others in the parish; but she turned the discourse, and now cast
               a look of pity on poor Mrs. Woodly, who was turning and matching the fragments of
               her broken tea-pot. ‘Mrs. Woodly,’ said she, smiling, ‘let Davy go to the shop and
               choose another, and say that I will pay for it.’ He went instantly, and said he would
               bring a blue one. When the boy was gone, they all began to talk very freely, and Miss
               Wideland inquired of Mrs. Woodly when she heard from her son <span class="smcaps">Will</span>. This question made the poor woman low-spirited, for she had not heard of him for
               a whole twelvemonth.’But,’ said she, ‘I live in hopes that I shall see him again;
               only my husband says that Jamaica is a sad, unhealthy place.’ Here old Master Woodly
               said that he ‘had a brother once, a fine young man, who died there; but a great many
               came home, and why may not my grandson? If we could but have a peace, I should reckon
               upon seeing him again, old as I am.’ ‘Ay,’ said Mrs. Woodly, as she took a pinch of
               snuff, ‘but Heaven only knows when we shall have that blessing. I am sure the flour
               has been so dear, and they say it is because of the war, that I don’t know how we
               can live another half year as we have done this. I do so long for a bit of meat, when
               the butcher rides by with his basket! To be sure, my husband may be better now, as
               the spring comes on; and I always find a comfort in hoping, though my hopes are often
               disappointed.’ ‘And are you not able to buy meat?’ said Miss Wideland. ‘I hope you
               have had some allowance these hard times.’ ‘Why, I will tell you how it is, young
               lady,’ said the old man (for Mrs. Woodly was obliged to go after Jane); ‘the rich
               part of our parish call our broom-making a trade, and I believe we have had less help
               on that account. We tried to persuade our son to go and plead our cause to the farmers,
               but I verily believe he would starve first, though he never was much richer than he
               is now, which is not exactly the case with me. I once held a farm—’ While the old
               man was thus speaking, in came Davy with the tea-pot. ‘Here’s a nice blue one, mother!
               Mr. Snapgroat asked me if I broke the old one; but I told him you broke it yourself.’
               They now made Davy be silent, and the old man went on with his story thus: ‘I was
               saying, miss, that I once held a farm; I did not live in this house, it is true; but
               the old man is now living in a workhouse, about ten miles off, who lived as a farmer
               in this very house. You see, miss, that it has been much larger than it is now.’ ‘Ay,’
               said Davy, ‘and my mother says that the room where I sleep was the cheese-chamber.’
               ‘Hold your tongue, boy,’ said his mother and grandfather; ‘it is very rude to talk
               while other people are speaking.’ Miss Wideland was much affected at what she heard,
               and, indeed, did not like to hear of troubles which she could not prevent; but promised
               that if they still found themselves distressed, and would tell her so, she would state
               their case to her father and the other farmers, and do all she could to help them.
               Mrs. Woodly wiped her eyes, and Davy looked as if he was going to make some remark
               about it; but at that moment he saw something stir in a bundle which the young lady
               held on her lap, and, without taking his eyes off, went close to see what it was.</p><br/><p class="noCount">CHAP. IV.</p>
            <p class="noCount">‘<span class="smcaps">What</span> can it be alive in this handkerchief?’ thought Davy; ‘I should like to know.’</p>
            <p class="noCount">Miss Wideland saw that he had discovered something living, and could not help smiling
               to see him peeping round her bundle so closely. She told him to have patience, and
               she would show him what it was. ‘But,’ said she, ‘if your mother is so poor that she
               cannot afford to buy meat for her self, I doubt she can never afford to keep this
               poor little animal, which was just going to be drowned. I could not bear to see it
               go to the pond, so I brought it to your mother, to see if you could keep it amongst
               you. It is but a little creature; it will not eat much.’ She then untied the bundle,
               and set down a very handsome little puppy, and then they all looked at it with pity.
               And when it ran round the cat and barked, Davy was even more delighted than he had
               been with the sixpence. ‘O mother, we will keep it. I know my father will like it;
               I will go and fetch him.’ Away he ran to the shed, where his father was making brooms,
               and persuaded him to come in and see the puppy. His father, finding that Miss Wideland
               was there, came with him; but more to see the young lady who had been Davy’s friend,
               than to see the little dog. They all thus met together, and Mrs. Woodly and her husband
               both thought what pleasure they should have found in bringing out a mug of their own
               ale; but malt had been too dear for that for many months past, so they said nothing
               about it, but agreed with Davy that it was a very pretty dog. But when he talked of
               keeping it, his mother whispered to him that they had nothing to feed it with, and
               could not think of starving it, for that would be worse than drowning. Davy rubbed
               his head, and his eyes shone as he turned them from his mother, and without speaking
               another word, he went to Miss Wideland’s knee, and looking up, said, ‘Ma’am, will
               not you let me have some milk for the puppy every morning, if I come for it?’ ‘Yes,
               Davy,’ said she, ‘that I will; and some for your mother too, if she will keep the
               dog.’ ‘I will come, then,’ said he briskly: ‘I wonder if it will grow big enough to
               draw my turnip-cart, as Jack Greenway’s dog does. And oh, mother, what shall its name
               be?’ ‘Why,’ said she, ‘I think it ought to be <span class="smcaps">Pity</span>, for pity saved his life.’ So they all agreed to call him so, and to keep him for
               pity’s sake.</p>
            <p class="noCount">All this time they minded nothing but the boy and the puppy; but it was now time for
               Miss Wideland to tell what she called for, besides bringing the dog. She was going
               to a village about seven miles off, to visit her aunt; and she meant to go in her
               little chaise, and there being many gates to open, she wanted Davy to go with her,
               which would be a charming ride, she promising to take care of him, if his parents
               would let him go. They all said that he would be a very little footman; but they could
               not refuse her, for she had been very good to them. She was to go the next morning,
               and when she left them they promised that the boy should be ready. This was a longer
               journey than he had ever taken, and he kept thinking to himself what he should see—what
               shapes the trees, the fields, and bridges would be, which they might have to pass.
               In short, he dreamed all night of riding.</p>
            <p class="noCount">When the morning came he made himself as smart as he could, and was setting off, when
               he put his hand to his head! It was very odd that when it was agreed that he should
               go, neither Davy, nor his father nor mother, had thought of one thing, which was,
               that he had no hat to go in! They were all vexed, and could hardly help laughing at
               their own folly and forgetfulness. But Davy was not in a laughing mood, when his father
               declared that he could not go, and said at the same time: ‘You know, my boy, that
               I wish you had a hat; but wishing will not buy one, and I am sure I have no money.’
               Davy cried heartily. Perhaps there is not a little boy in England who would not have
               cried, had he been in his place. But in the midst of his tears, he begged that they
               would let him go to Miss Wideland: ‘Perhaps,’ said he, ‘she will take me without a
               hat.’ His father said that, at any rate, he must go to Mr. Wideland’s, if it was only
               to say that he could not go the journey. ‘So I will then,’ answered Davy, and ran
               out of the house, wiping his eyes with the skirt of his coat. He went down the pasture-ground
               as quick as he had ever done in his life, and found the chaise at the door. The young
               lady was just going to step up, with the reins in her hand, saying, ‘Come, Davy, get
               up.’ But at that moment, she too bethought herself that the boy could not go seven
               miles from home bareheaded. What was to be done? All the old hats in the house were
               a great deal too big for him; even Abel Cloutham, the farmer’s boy, had a head as
               big again as Davy’s. But Abel’s head had grown a great deal, and he had upstairs an
               old cap, which he had made long ago out of a cat’s skin, with the hair on. He was
               ordered to bring it down; and when they had dusted it and knocked out the ear wigs,
               it was found to be just the size, and would make a very good shift. So up he got,
               and sat close by Miss Wideland, and the horse being very willing to go, they set off
               in good spirits. And well they might, for the trees began to show their new leaves,
               the air was mild, the sun shone delightfully, and in half an hour Davy found himself
               on strange ground, and began to ask a great many questions.</p><br/><p class="noCount">CHAP. V.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="smcaps">As</span> Davy was not at all afraid to speak what he thought to his friend Miss Wideland,
               he made many remarks on what he passed by, and what he saw at a distance. They had
               to ride over a hill where they could see a long way round, and where Davy found that
               the world was much larger than he had thought it was. Amongst other things, they talked
               on the subject of hats; and Miss Wideland asked him how long he had been without one,
               and how it happened? ‘Why,’ said he, ‘I had a hat last summer. It was a pretty good
               one: it had but one hole in it, and I could have mended that. But Jack Greenway and
               I went to gather nuts, a long while ago, before the snow came, you know. We were got
               into the middle of the wood, and found a great many. We soon gathered our hats full,
               and we wanted to fill our pockets besides. So we set down our hats under a tree, and
               went from them to gather more, until I said it was time to go home; but Jack would
               not go. We stayed a little longer, and then it was almost night; and we went to look
               for our hats, but could not find the tree where we had left them. We both cried a
               little, because it grew darker, but were forced to make haste home without them. But
               we talked a great deal about it as we went along, and I believe Jack’s father beat
               him for it; but he soon got another hat, for his father keeps the <span class="ital">Dragon</span>, and gets more money than mine.’ ‘So you lost your nuts as well as your hat, Davy,’
               said Miss Wideland. ‘Yes, ma’am,’ said he; ‘and I should not have had any supper,
               I believe, if my grandfather had not taken my part. My father said it was a sad affair,
               and that if I could not find it the next day I must go without a hat, and so I have
               ever since; for Jack and I went in the morning and searched about the wood, but could
               not find the tree where we had left them. Perhaps some other boys had found them,
               and some of them might want a hat as much as I have done since: and so my grandfather
               says.’ ‘And don’t your father sometimes take a stick to your back, Davy?’ ‘No, ma’am,
               only when he is very angry he talks to me, and tells me that I don’t love him, and
               will not hear me when I tell him that I do; and I am sure I do, for all that.’</p>
            <p class="noCount">While he was thus telling his story, they rode over a fine bridge, with a broad clear
               water beneath it, before a gentleman’s house. There happened to be a pleasure-boat
               with a sail spread, carrying a party of ladies, and a gentleman playing a clarionet.
               This was all new to Davy. He had never thought of such a thing as that the wind would
               blow people along upon the water. Miss Wideland told him that a ship on the great
               sea was moved in the same manner, and that some of them would carry a hundred great
               guns, and a thousand men. ‘And shall we see any such as we go along?’ said Davy. It
               was a simple question; but the first notion we get of things is very often simple
               enough. The chaise now rattled along a turnpike-road, and they met a fine regiment
               of horse soldiers. This was a noble sight, and Davy asked if his brother <span class="smcaps">Will</span> wore a coat like theirs. ‘No,’ said Miss Wideland, ‘your brother is a foot soldier,
               and is gone abroad in such a ship as we were talking about.’ Davy now looked across
               the country till his eyes ached; but Miss Wideland looked at nothing but a horseman
               coming down the hill before them; and though her footman pointed here and there at
               flocks, trees, and churches within sight, she took no notice of him or of what he
               said.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The gentleman soon met them. He was mounted on a beautiful bay horse, and no sooner
               came to the side of the chaise than he turned about and rode back with them; but hinted
               that perhaps Davy could ride his horse, and himself ride with the lady. But Miss Wideland
               would by no means trust Davy on so spirited an animal, for she had promised his parents
               to take care of him.</p>
            <p class="noCount">This gentleman’s name was <span class="smcaps">Stanmore</span>. He often leaned over the side of the chaise, and said he was very glad to meet her.
               He was a young man, and seemed as full of spirits as his horse. They rode very gently
               along for the last mile, and at length came to Mrs. <span class="smcaps">Meadowly’s</span>, which was the end of their journey, for this good lady was aunt to Miss Wideland.
               Mr. Stanmore was off his horse, and had lifted the young lady from the chaise, before
               any servant could come to wait on them. At last came Mrs. Meadowly’s man, old John
               Harrows, who took charge of the horses and carriage; and Mr. Stanmore led the young
               lady into the parlour, while Davy was sent into the kitchen to have some cake and
               warm ale.</p><br/><p class="noCount">CHAP. VI.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><span class="smcaps">The</span> maid’s name was Betty. She was a kind-hearted, good servant, but liked to know as
               much as she could about every body. She was quite pleased with Davy’s little fair
               face, and gave him a stool by the fire, and then asked him a great many questions;
               as, how many brothers and sisters he had? how old he was? and then asked all she could
               about who that gentleman was who came riding with them? Davy said that they met that
               gentleman on the road. ‘And did you hear his name?’ said Betty. ‘Yes,’ answered Davy;
               ‘Miss Wideland called him Mr. Stanmore.’ ‘I thought so,’ said she; ‘I have heard something
               of him: I shall see him when I carry the dinner in. And did the lady speak kindly
               to him? What did she say?’ ‘I did not hear all that she said,’ answered Davy, ‘but
               she looked pleased.’</p>
            <p class="noCount">They were talking thus, when in came a dog of a monstrous size, and walked towards
               Davy, who got up from his seat; for, as he sat, the dog’s head was as high as his
               own, and he was sadly afraid of him. But Betty halloed: ‘Get out, you great beast,
               and take that with you!’ throwing down a large bone which had not been picked very
               clean. It was so large that Davy at first verily believed it to be a joint of meat;
               and when the dog was gone, said that his mother would have been glad of it. He told
               her that he had a dog at home, but it was not so big as that, and he hoped it never
               would be; but if he could get a bit of meat off that great dog’s dinner, he would
               carry it home for <span class="smcaps">Pity</span>. Betty gave him a bit directly, which he carefully put in his pocket.</p>
            <p class="noCount">There was time enough before dinner for Davy to take a walk, and Betty called the
               servant-boy to go with him, and show him about; but he no sooner came in than he stared
               like a fool. This Jack Bramble was an ill-mannerly and an ill-natured boy, and was
               laughing at Davy’s cap. He did not much mind Betty, or any one else, but called Davy
               <span class="ital">Cat’s Head</span>, and some other names, for which Betty threw the rolling-pin after him with all her
               might, which rattled on his head and shoulders as he shut the door, saying, ‘that
               it was a shame for a great boy like him to insult a little one, and a stranger too.’
               Betty was very right, for of all ill-manners insulting a stranger is the worst. Davy,
               therefore, took a walk by himself, but was careful not to go out of sight of the house.
               When he returned he said he had been talking with two boys, who were keeping sheep
               upon the hill, and they had been disputing about the sheep, for they were not like
               Mr. Wideland’s sheep: these had white faces and no horns. The two boys would have
               it that their sheep were the best in England; but he did not believe they were better
               than Mr. Wideland’s. It was now dinner-time, and Betty could not stop to hear all
               he had to say.</p>
            <p class="noCount">When dinner was done in the parlour, Davy had his in the kitchen with Betty, and John
               Harrows, and Jack Bramble. The latter again began to laugh at Davy’s cap, which lay
               on the dresser; but he remembered the rolling-pin, and was soon quiet.</p>
            <p class="noCount">After they had dined, Betty, as she did her work, amused herself by singing a song
               which Davy had never heard before. It was quite new, she said, for she bought the
               ballad at the last fair; and when she learned from Davy that his brother <span class="smcaps">Will</span> was a soldier, and that his mother sung sometimes when his father was well, she gave
               him the ballad, and charged him to give it to his mother. Betty still kept singing
               and working, when in came Miss Wideland and took Davy by the hand and led him into
               the parlour to her aunt and Mr. Stanmore.’This is my footman,’ said she, ‘and I assure
               you he has more sense than many a clumsy boy of twice his size.’</p>
            <p class="noCount">Davy had to answer many questions, and after drinking half a glass of wine, had to
               give an account of what he had seen by the way, which he did, to the great amusement
               of the party. But he was not so happy as he would have been at home, and was glad
               to hear Miss Wideland say it was time to get the chaise ready, as she wished to be
               home by daylight. Mr. Stanmore gave him sixpence as he came out of the parlour, and
               Mrs. Meadowly gave him another, and a cheesecake to carry home for Jane; and when
               he went into the kitchen for his cap, Betty filled his coat-pockets with apples, and
               again charged him to give the ballad to his mother. With a heart as light as a feather,
               he took his seat in the chaise; and when Miss Wideland could get away from Mr. Stanmore,
               they drove off towards home.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The young lady returned by a different road to that by which they came; for they now
               passed through a large park, over the smooth grass for three miles together, where
               was many a beautiful clump of fir-trees, and many a herd of deer. As the chaise approached
               the deer, they ran into a cluster with such fantastic skips, that Davy observed they
               looked as if they were jumping for a wager. And now, indeed, the boy talked more and
               faster than he had done during his morning’s ride; and having learned part of the
               tune of Betty’s song, he was occasionally singing half the way home. Miss Wideland
               asked him if Betty had given him anything to drink in the kitchen.’Yes,’ said he,
               very innocently, ‘I had some small beer twice.’ ‘Then you are not tipsy?’ said she.
               ‘No, ma’am; only I am so very glad, that I can hardly help crying.’ They arrived at
               Mr. Wideland’s about sunset, and Davy went merrily up the pasture ground to tell his
               good fortune and his adventures to his parents. </p><br/><p class="noCount">CHAP. VII.</p>
            <p class="noCount">‘<span class="smcaps">Here</span> I am, mother,’ said Davy, giving Jane her present, and placing his apples on the
               table; ‘and I have got something besides!’ Here he pulled out his money, when they
               all said, ‘We see you are here, but what have you got upon your head? You have not
               been in that cap, have you?’ ‘Yes, I have; and it is my own, too.’ They were highly
               delighted with the account he gave of his journey, and his mother made him tell all
               about Mr. Stanmore, for she knew nothing of him; but she found from Davy that Miss
               Wideland talked more to him than she did to her aunt; and asking him further, as to
               whether he had ever seen this Mr. Stanmore at Mr. Wideland’s, Davy said ‘No,’ but
               he thought Miss Wideland must have seen him before, because, as he turned back into
               the parlour to make a bow, he saw their two faces close together and Mr. Stanmore
               said ‘Get along, you rogue.’ Mrs. Woodly could not help smiling, but Davy went on
               saying: ‘I wonder if my grandfather was ever further from home than I have been to-day?’
               In this manner did the poor boy express his pleasure, and it did their hearts good
               to find that he loved those who were kind to them as well as to himself. In the midst
               of his joy, the dog crept from under the stool in the corner, and put his feet upon
               his knee; when he directly bethought himself of the meat which Betty had given him,
               and Pity had a good supper. Old Master Woodly made the smoke fly faster than usual
               from his pipe, and said: ‘That’s a good boy; your father was just such another, only
               he was so stubborn with it.’ They now handled and looked at the cap, and all agreed
               that it would do well for a time, and that he must take care of it. Davy answered,
               ‘I like it well enough; but you know, father, it is not a new hat.’</p>
            <p class="noCount">This was very true, and his father assured him that he should have a hat at <span class="ital">Brookside fair</span>, where he should go with a load of brooms, in the month of May. This was a long time
               to look for; and besides, his mother said, with a deep sigh, she was afraid that Mr.
               Snapgroat would have most of that money for the bread they had been eating during
               the winter. However, she was not willing to vex Davy, and so said no more about it,
               but thought much of this young Mr. Stanmore, whom the boy had been speaking of; for
               she saw plainly of what amazing consequence it is to the poor to have their rich neighbours
               kind and tender-hearted.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Davy now sat considering to himself, as if he had not done all that he was bidden
               to do; then, fumbling in all his pockets, he pulled out the ballad, and said: ‘O mother,
               I have got something for you. Betty gave me this ballad, it is about a soldier; and
               she can sing a great deal louder than you. I wish you could hear her.’ His mother
               took the ballad, and began to read it aloud, but stopped in the middle, because it
               was about <span class="ital">Soldier Will</span>, and throwing it on the floor went hastily into the other room. The old man took
               up the ballad, and looked with utmost tenderness and concern on Mrs. Woodly. But Davy
               could not tell what to make of all this. He had often seen his mother cry, as he called
               it, when she was very much pleased; but he could not see anything in the song that
               could please her, unless it was about his brother <span class="smcaps">Will</span>.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The old man then read the ballad to them all, as follows; for Mrs. Woodly soon returned,
               and Davy was very quiet.</p>

               <p class="noCount">A little boy seldom cuts a more ridiculous figure than when he is tired and sleepy,
                  and still objects to going to bed. Davy was not one of this sort. He was almost asleep
                  before he could say his prayers, and his father being unwell, went to bed at the same
                  time; but Mrs. Woodly had all her irons at the fire, (for this was Saturday night),
                  and the old man sat up with her, and read several chapters of the book of Job, until
                  both of them felt their minds quite easy and composed, and at a late hour retired
                  to rest, offering up as pure and earnest a prayer as ever flowed from the patient
                  or the good.</p><br/><p class="noCount">CHAP. VIII.</p>
               <p class="noCount"><span class="smcaps">Sunday</span>, a day of rest. A country village is still and quiet at all times; but on a Sunday
                  morning it is still more peaceable. You do not hear the miller’s cart go by, nor the
                  ploughman’s horses with their clinking chains, going to the field. Even the cowboys,
                  though they drive the cows to and from the meadows, know better than to sing and halloo
                  as they go. All the people, though they do not dress fine and gay, make themselves
                  as clean as they can. Soon after breakfast the clerk of the parish goes by, with the
                  great church key in his hand, and you soon hear the bells begin to chime. This is
                  not heard as we hear it in great cities and towns, along with many other bells and
                  other noises; but, as it comes only once a week, the sound is always pleasing, always
                  new, and everybody knows what it means.</p>
               <p class="noCount">The Woodlys’ family lived at some distance from the church; but they heard the bells,
                  and Davy and his grandfather set off together, as they always did. Mrs. Woodly was
                  getting ready, and, as she put on her cap, and shook her clean apron, Mr. Woodly,
                  who was reading the Bible, said, in a low voice, ‘Good Heaven deliver me from trouble.’
                  He had staid away from church several Sundays before, and did not mean to go now;
                  but when his wife asked him to go with her, he said: ‘I can’t find the pleasure I
                  used to do in going to church. I am sunk in poverty: I have no decent clothes. These
                  times have ruined me, and I cannot be what I was; and though in my heart I despise
                  the sneer of a fool, yet I know that the ’Squire’s gamekeeper, and some others, will
                  let me know that they have better coats than mine, although perhaps not of their own
                  buying.’ </p>
               <p class="noCount">Mrs. Woodly was vexed to hear him talk so, though she knew what he said to be true,
                  and still asked him tenderly to go with her, saying it would ease his mind; and at
                  any rate would be better than sitting at home. But he still answered ‘No.’ ‘Well,’
                  said she, ‘I will go if it were only to pray for <span class="smcaps">Peace</span>, and that I may see my poor boy <span class="smcaps">Will</span>, before I die.’ At the sound of peace and his son’s name, he rose instantly from
                  his seat, brushed his hat and shoes, and went to church with his wife. He was one
                  of the psalm-singers, and there were several neighbours glad to see him; and he has
                  often said since that he never sung better, nor felt more pleasure than he did that
                  day.</p>
               <p class="noCount">The sun shone in at every window, and cheered the hearts of the people; and there
                  was no noise, except some loud whispering amongst the boys, partly about Davy’s cap,
                  which was handed from one end of the bench to the other; but the clerk soon set them
                  to rights, for it is very rude and scandalous to talk at church.</p>
               <p class="noCount">The clergyman was an old gentleman who had known the family of the Woodlys for many
                  years, and as he came through the church-yard, after service was over, he nodded to
                  Mr. Woodly, and said he was very glad to see him so well, and to see him there, and
                  asked after all his family. Just at this instant <span class="ital">Will Haynes</span>, the gamekeeper passed them, and gave a look of contempt and scorn on poor Woodly
                  and his wife, who thus saw the wide difference between a wise man and a fool.</p>
               <p class="noCount">The greatest news in the churchyard to-day, was a whisper that Miss Wideland was going
                  to be married, but nobody knew when.</p>
               <p class="noCount">A young woman whose name was Lydia Downs, walked part of the way home with Mrs. Woodly,
                  and asked very earnestly after her son <span class="smcaps">Will</span>; for he had spent his Sundays, and all his leisure hours with Lydia, before he met
                  with the party of recruits that took him from home, and persuaded him to be a soldier.
                  Lydia said that the ’Squire, her master, believed that war would be over in six months,
                  and, ‘Who knows,’ said she, ‘but he may come home again?’</p><br/><p class="noCount">CHAP. IX.</p>
               <p class="noCount"><span class="smcaps">It</span> has already been said that Davy was to have a new hat at the fair in the month of
                  May, and his father worked hard for many weeks, until the time was nearly come.</p>
               <p class="noCount">The load of brooms lay ready in the shed, but how was a cart to be had? Old John Headland
                  was the only <span class="ital">little</span> farmer now left in the village, and he used a cart to do his work. He had brought
                  up a large family, but they were all gone from him to seek their own living; he was,
                  therefore, glad of the help of any of his neighbours in harvest time to get his corn
                  in. A bargain was soon made, founded on that excellent old truth, that ‘one good turn
                  deserves another.’ The little farmer lent his horses and cart to the broom-maker for
                  the day, on condition that when his field of barley should be ripe the broommaker
                  would come and help him to get it home.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Davy was to have gone with his father to the fair, but who can foresee what may happen
                  to disappoint us when we expect a pleasure? Old Master Woodly about two days before
                  the time was taken ill, and was forced to keep his bed; and how could Mrs. Woodly
                  look after and attend a sick man and nurse Jane besides? So Davy had to stay at home
                  to wait on his grandfather; and he did it cheerfully because he knew that had he himself
                  been ill his grandfather would have waited on him.</p>
               <p class="noCount">His father drove away the cartload of brooms, and Davy sat down by his grandfather’s
                  bedside, and as he heard his mother say something about going to the doctor’s for
                  something to cure his grandfather, he did not expect his new hat.</p>
               <p class="noCount">The poor old man groaned and complained sadly, but still he found Davy a good companion,
                  and made him read several parts of the Prayer Book and the Testament and told him
                  where to look for them; for by this time the little fellow had learned to read well,
                  because he was constantly trying. The old man told Davy many things which happened
                  when he was a little boy, and seemed fond of talking of past times; and when Davy
                  asked him how long it was ago, he was quite concerned to see the tears run down his
                  grandfather’s cheeks while he answered: ‘How long ago, my boy? Why about sixty-five
                  years! I had then brothers and sisters, but I have outlived them all, and here I am
                  a trouble to your father and mother, but <span class="ital">God’s will be done!</span>’ Davy stood up by the bed and cried too, though he hardly knew what for. The old
                  man said that his pains came so thick upon him they put him in mind of the horse that
                  was stung to death by bees. Davy asked when that was, and where, and how long ago?
                  Master Woodly told him to look in the bottom of his wig-box, and there he would find
                  some verses he had made about it; ‘and,’ said he, ‘put the other pillow under my head,
                  and I will read it to you; it may make me forget my pains a little while. This is
                  a true story, Davy; for I assure you I saw the poor horse die.’</p>

               <p class="noCount">While Davy was pitying the poor horse, and Master Woodly laying down the paper and
                  groaning sadly, as before, in came Abel Cloutham, who lived at Mr. Wideland’s, and
                  set down a basket containing a bottle of wine and a small chicken, saying that Mr.
                  Stanmore was at their house, and had been talking about Davy; and, hearing that Master
                  Woodly was ill, he and his young mistress had sent a little present, and desired to
                  know how he did. ‘I do very badly,’ said the old man; ‘but they are very good, and
                  I thank them.’ Then as he turned his face to the pillow, said, more softly: ‘I know
                  this comes from that good soul, Miss Wideland; and, if I ever live to walk again,
                  I will use the first strength I have to go down myself to thank her.’</p><br/><p class="noCount">CHAP. X.</p>
               <p class="noCount"><span class="smcaps">Late</span> at night Mr. Woodly came home, having left the cart and horses at neighbour Headland’s.
                  He brought a phial of medicine from the doctor’s, which cost two shillings; and as
                  two other such were taken by his father, he paid as much for them as would have bought
                  the boy two new hats. But they had the pleasure to see the sick man grow better every
                  day, and he was soon able to walk out, or to sit in his favourite chair at the top
                  of the garden. Here he would listen to Davy’s chat, or sometimes sing psalms. It had
                  a strange sound to sing psalms in the open air; but they had a blackbird, which always
                  sung in the garden hedge, and linnets and thrushes without number, were within hearing,
                  all singing from morning till night, and what was theirs but singing psalms? The hedges
                  were white with the May-blossom, and you could not set your foot in the pasture without
                  treading on a cowslip. The heart which could not rejoice at such a sight must surely
                  be either very unhappy, very insensible, or very wicked.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Everything seemed to smile on this family once again. Thus the summer passed on, week
                  after week, and nothing could give more pleasure than to see that the coming harvest
                  was likely to bring a general blessing; and when it was ripe, even the farmers themselves
                  said that finer crops had not been seen for many years.</p>
               <p class="noCount">The busy time of harvest soon began. Mr. Woodly, according to his bargain, helped
                  neighbour Headland home with his barley, while Mrs. Woodly and Davy went every day
                  to glean in such wheat-fields as were cleared along with all the poor women and children
                  in the parish. Jane went too, and when she was sleepy was laid down on some sunny
                  bank, where she slept as sound as in a bed. They got, during the harvest, a quantity
                  of good corn, and had hopes of meeting the winter without such dread as they had felt
                  before.</p>
               <p class="noCount">It was the talk amongst the gleaners that Miss Wideland was to be married when harvest
                  was over, and that Mr. Stanmore was to have the farm which the ’Squire held, as the
                  ’Squire was going to live in London. All this proved true, which is more than can
                  always be said of tales told in the field or in the church-yard. Nobody liked Will
                  Haynes, the gamekeeper: he was an insolent fellow, and they were glad he was going;
                  nay, it was a certain fact that the ’Squire, his master, had not done so much good
                  in the neighbourhood as his wealth and station enabled him to do, and such squires
                  might as well live in London as anywhere else.</p>
               <p class="noCount">September was now come. The days grew shorter, and every face was tanned with the
                  sun, but every heart was glad of the plenty which the earth afforded; and both the
                  rich and the poor began to think of providing wood and furze to lay up for winter
                  firing.</p>
               <p class="noCount">But the most particular thing which happened to the Woodlys’ family was this: Miss
                  Wideland called one morning, and said that Mr. Stanmore would soon be their neighbour,
                  and then he would take Davy to live with him, and would provide him in clothes, and
                  teach him writing and figures; ‘and,’ said she, ‘I know Davy will be a good boy, because
                  I have tried him.’ Mrs. Woodly thanked her, as we often do, more with our looks than
                  our words; and Miss Wideland had a good mind to sit down and tell the poor woman all
                  that was going on; but she did not, thinking, perhaps, that young women ought to hold
                  their tongues on such occasions, for a wedding in a village is sure to be known time
                  enough. Mrs. Woodly, therefore, who understood her meaning, only said: ‘I do believe
                  that the gentleman is worthy of you, and I wish you a long life of happiness.’</p><br/><p class="noCount">CHAP. XI.</p>
               <p class="noCount"><span class="smcaps">Davy</span> was not at home when the young lady called; but he was highly delighted when he heard
                  that he was to live with his old friend Miss Wideland, and told his mother that he
                  knew she was to be married on Wednesday morning, for he heard the maid say so. And
                  so it proved; for the clergyman came to the church, and a gay company from Mr. Wideland’s,
                  amongst whom was Mr. Stanmore, who was full of mirth and good-will, and the sensible,
                  modest, Charlotte Wideland. Half the people in the parish were in the church-yard
                  by the time the ceremony was over, and most of the young women curtsied and nodded,
                  with as much freedom as they dared. The boys halloed and tumbled on the grass, and
                  the men set the bells a-ringing. It was too late in the year to have flowers to strew
                  in their path; but who would not rather have his path strewn with good wishes than
                  with the sweetest flowers that ever grew?</p>
               <p class="noCount">Lydia Downs, though she lived in the ’Squire’s family, was not going with them to
                  London, but had agreed to live at Mr. Stanmore’s; so that she only had a new master
                  and mistress: but the ’Squire’s family were not going away until the middle of October.
                  She knew that Davy was to live with her at Mr. Stanmore’s; but she thought much more
                  of Will Woodly than she did of Davy.</p>
               <p class="noCount">About a fortnight after the marriage of Miss Wideland, Mr. Snapgroat brought a letter
                  from the town, where he had been to buy goods for his shop. It was directed: ‘<em>To Lydia Downs, at Peter Broughton’s, Esq.</em>,’ and dated ‘<span class="ital">Jamaica, June 10th</span>, 1801.’</p>
               <p class="noCount">How rejoiced was she to find the truth and constancy of her lover!</p>
               <p class="noCount">The first words of the letter were the sweetest she had ever read in her life:</p><br/><p class="noCount">‘My Dear Lydia,</p>
               <p class="noCount">I write to you because you were the last person I saw who was dear to me when I left
                  England. A vast and dangerous ocean rolls between us; yet, my dear girl, I hope to
                  see you again. I shall never be happy till I do. If ever I should come home, and find
                  you and my parents, and my poor old grandfather alive, I shall be crazy with joy.
                  And though I have been a fool, and left you, may I hope, Lydia, that you will not
                  marry another, until you are sure that I am dead! Sometimes amongst my comrades I
                  forget for awhile that I am so far from home; but I am sure to think of you all when
                  I am alone. If my relations are living tell them that if I could hear of peace, I
                  should be almost sure of seeing them and you again, for our regiment is to return
                  to England. I wish I could see you read this letter; I could then tell whether you
                  still thought or cared for your old friend and true lover,</p>
               <p class="noCount"><span class="smcaps">William Woodly</span>.</p><br/><p class="noCount">P.S. Tell my friends that I am well. A thousand blessings on you, my dear girl. If
                  I write any more I shall cry, and my fellow-soldiers will laugh at me.’</p>
               <p class="noCount">____</p>
               <p class="noCount">If Will had really seen Lydia reading this letter, he must have been blind if he had
                  not found that she remembered him truly. With her eyes full of tears she hastily put
                  the letter into her bosom, and set off to Mrs. Woodly’s; but had to turn back for
                  her bonnet, which she had forgot in her hurry. She then began her journey again, and,
                  as people often run when they are pleased, so did Lydia; and when she got there was
                  so out of breath that she could only say ‘Your son Will!’ But she soon gave Mr. Woodly
                  the letter, who read it through, but was so much affected that he went into the yard
                  and left them to themselves.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Mrs. Woodly then read it with all the tenderness of a mother; and old Master Woodly
                  put on his spectacles, and read it again, and said, ‘I knew the boy would be true
                  to you, Lydia; I knew he would! And we may very likely all see him again, and be happier
                  than we have been.’</p><br/><p class="noCount">CHAP. XII.</p>
               <p class="noCount"><span class="smcaps">Lydia</span> went home with a heart full of pleasure and expectation; and it was not more than
                  ten days, as she waited at table, that she heard the news from London, that <span class="smcaps">Peace</span> was signed. The ’Squire read it himself, and as he had laid a wager upon how long
                  the war would continue, and had now won it, he got up from table, and shouted as loud
                  as he could. Lydia trembled all over; and, without stopping to consider who would
                  fill her place, or wait on her master, directly left the room, and went as quick as
                  before to Mrs. Woodly, who thanked God for the news, in a manner that would have moved
                  a stone to have heard and seen her.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Davy, understanding that his brother Will was coming home, asked more questions than
                  any of them had time to answer. They talked so loud that <span class="smcaps">Pity</span> barked along with them. The new-married Mrs. Stanmore now came, almost as fast as
                  Lydia had done, and brought the same news; and said that the price of corn would fall,
                  and they would have better times.</p>
               <p class="noCount">All this time Mr. Woodly was gone out, and nobody knew whither. The truth was that
                  he had been overjoyed at what he heard, and had set out instantly to a little market-town
                  at a distance of two miles to hear for a certainty whether it was true, and to buy
                  something which he had long wanted for his boy Davy. While they were speaking of him,
                  they saw him coming over a field at the distance of half a mile.</p>
               <p class="noCount">He soon came in and looked full of joy too; for he had there heard the news of peace,
                  and had left the town all in an uproar. They thus all talked together, except old
                  Master Woodly, who sat in his elbow-chair, and talked to himself, and perhaps enjoyed
                  as much pleasure as any of them.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Mrs. Stanmore and Lydia stayed to talk over the good news as long as they could, and
                  then left them as rich in happiness as any family in England.</p>
               <p class="noCount">It grew almost dark, and as Mr. Woodly had been walking, and they had dined long before,
                  Davy took the bellows and made the fire roar; and his mother put two extra spoonsful
                  of tea into the blue tea-pot, to make a comfortable cup. The fire shone cheerfully
                  round upon the floor, and Davy began to ask what his father had been from home for,
                  and what he had brought in that brown paper parcel under the table? His father answered:
                  ‘Why, I have been, my boy, to please myself as well as you. I would not tell you anything
                  of my going, for fear you should be disappointed, as you have been before.’ Here the
                  old man said, slily, ‘Davy, I think I can guess what it is;’ and so said his mother.
                  ‘Why, yes, father,’ said Mr. Woodly, ‘you may guess, and my wife too, for she knows
                  how I had set my heart upon it; and you both know too, that the poor boy has been
                  without a hat this twelvemonth. And while we were obliged to receive help of the parish,
                  I should not have valued the hat if I could have bought it then, so much as I do now
                  I buy it with my own money. Come here, Davy.’ Then, putting the <span class="smcaps">Hat</span> on the boy’s head, he seemed full as pleased as Davy himself. It was a conquest over
                  poverty:—his heart glowed with a father’s pride; and, without some such pride, no
                  father will buy new hats for his boys, nor will any boy try to be foremost in his
                  learning. If, therefore, any good boy should read this story, and should have been
                  very poor, and often disappointed, I earnestly advise him to have patience, and to
                  remember <em>Little Davy’s New Hat</em>.</p>
