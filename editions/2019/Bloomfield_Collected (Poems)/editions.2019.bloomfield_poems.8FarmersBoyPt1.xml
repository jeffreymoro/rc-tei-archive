        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">Editorial Introduction</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Bloomfield’s most famous poem, one of the greatest as well as latest Georgics to be written in English, was also his most
          popular. In his lifetime, it went through fourteen official editions (pirated editions were published in France and America), was translated
          into Latin, and sold an estimated 51000 copies – putting it on a par with <title>Childe Harold</title> and <title>The Lay of the Last
            Minstrel</title> as one of the bestselling poems of the Romantic era. This popularity lasted: new editions regularly appeared until 1877;
          only in the twentieth century did interest decline. Admired by poets, including Southey and Wordsworth, as well as by the public, the poem
          was a critical success. It was also a seminal piece for labouring-class writers, including <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#ClareJohn">John Clare</ref>; its representation of Suffolk, meanwhile, influenced <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#ConstableJohn">John Constable</ref>’s art.</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">Composition</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Bloomfield himself is the main source concerning the history of the poem’s composition. In the Preface he wrote for the
          edition that appeared in the 1809 <title>Poems of Robert Bloomfield</title>, he quoted a letter he had written from
          London to his <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BloomfieldGeorge">brother George</ref> in Suffolk on <ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.10.html">16 September 1798</ref> sending the manuscript he had completed in June, and declaring</p>
        <quote>When I began it, I thought to myself that I could compleat it in a twelvemonth, allowing myself three months for each quarter; but I
          soon found that I could not, and indeed I made it longer than I at first intended. Nine tenths of it was put together as I sat at work,
          where there are usually six of us; no one in the house have any knowledge of what I have employed my thoughts about when I did not
          talk.</quote>
        <quote>I chose to do it in rhime for this reason; because I found allways that when I put two or three lines together in blank verse, or
          something that sounded like it, it was a great chance if it stood right when it came to be wrote down, for blank verse have ten syllables in
          a line, and this particular I could not adjust, nor bear in memory as I could rhimes. Winter, and half of Autumn were done long before I
          could find leisure to write them. In the Harvest Home you will find the essence of letters you have wrote formerly to London.</quote>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">These remarks date the poem’s origins to between May and December 1796; they also reveal the extraordinary circumstances of
          its composition: Bloomfield produced it not on the farm in Suffolk but in a crowded shoemakers’ garret in London -– the mental process
          hindered, or perhaps helped, by the repetitive noises of hammering and stitching, and by the patterns of his workmates’ conversation. This
          origin in urban labour and in labourers’ sociability, so different from the leisure and solitude in which the typically gentlemanly activity
          of poetic composition usually occurred, had its effect on the poem’s form and content: Bloomfield chose rhyming couplets because they helped
          him not only to attain prosodic regularity but also to memorise the verse; he depicted the harvest home not from first hand experience as a
          reaper but because his brother George, who had left London for Suffolk in 1784, had described it to him in letters.</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Despite its paperless origin, the poem was not affiliated to oral poetry. It was not based on the work songs or folk ballads
          that were performed on city street and in village pub, but on the highly literary form of the Georgic as represented by James Thomson’s
            <title>The Seasons </title>(issued in parts between 1725–30 and first collected in 1748) which had been among Bloomfield’s favourite
          reading since he had acquired a copy from a fellow London shoemaker in 1783 or 1784. His poem had, he explained, begun in set-piece
          episodes:</p>
        <quote>The parts of the poem first composed, before any thought was entertained of going through with the Seasons, were the morning scene in
          Spring, beginning ‘This task had <hi rend="ital">Giles</hi>,’ and the description of the lambs at play. </quote>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">From these initial scenes, the poem grew to four books, one for each season, totaling, by November 1797, just over 1500
          lines. Initially committed to memory, these were transcribed in the manuscript that Bloomfield patiently compiled and sent to George,
          warning him, in a <ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.11.html">letter of 7 November 1798</ref>,
          that ‘Having never been instructed in grammar, it may abound in faults of that kind which I am not aware of. The management of stops I don’t
          pretend to’ (a disclaimer also made by <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> about the manuscript of
            <title>Lyrical Ballads</title>). The MS survives and is held at the Houghton Library, Harvard University, MS Eng FMS 776.<note n="1"

        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">Publication</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">By November 1798, Bloomfield had already hawked the manuscript around London publishers without success. One, probably <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BentWilliam">William Bent</ref>, declined and suggested magazine publication in instalments; another, most likely <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LaneWilliam">William Lane</ref>, refused because he specialized in pulp novels (see letters <ref
            target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.6.html">6</ref>, <ref
            target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.7.html">7</ref>, <ref
            target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.8.html">8</ref>, and <ref

            Bloomfield</title>)</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Frustrated, Bloomfield sent the manuscript to George so that his mother should be able to read it. George, however, took it
          to a local gentleman who was unknown to Bloomfield – <ref type="m"  target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LofftCapel">Capel Lofft</ref> (1751–1824). Lofft was
          a radical Whig, and as such believed himself to be a ‘friend of the people’, an opinion that recommended the poem to him. He was an astute
          choice on George’s part, for he was not simply a traditional patron, prepared to offer a local man of talent a small donation or pension as
          part of his duty, but also an author and editor with influence in the expanding publishing market in which magazines and journals—the new
          means of publicizing books—had begun to flourish. He had commercial experience as well as the paternalist attitudes of a traditional Whig
          squire. He wrote to Bloomfield, declaring that ‘the example, as well as the Poem, may teach the rich, and the highly born or educated, not
          unnaturally to urge harsh and overbearing lines of distinction; but to be more attentive to the gifts bestowed by the common Father on
          mankind, than to an overweening conceit of their own privileges and advantages’ (see Preface to the stereotype <title>Poems of Robert
            Bloomfield</title>, 1809). Impressed by the poem both in its own right and as evidence that the poor and poorly educated were not
          naturally inferior, he sent it to <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#HillThomas">Thomas Hill</ref> (1760–1840), a man of letters who was
          well-connected on the London literary scene. Hill arranged to have it published by the firm of <ref type="m"
            target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#VernorThomas">Vernor</ref> and <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#HoodThomas">Hood</ref>, publishers of the journal
          he edited, <title>The Monthly Mirror</title>. While little direct information survives as to the terms of the arrangement, a dispute that
          arose between Lofft and Hood in November 1800 suggests that the firm spent £190 on the printing, giving Bloomfield £20 as an advance, and
          taking, it considered, a half interest in the copyright not just for the first but also for subsequent editions (meaning that royalties
          would be split 50/50 with Bloomfield). This, as Hood told Lofft when Lofft argued that the firm’s half interest did not outlast the first
          edition, was a handsome arrangement (see <ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.45.html">Letter
            45</ref>, 26 November 1800, of <title>LRB</title>). It was more typical for unknown, first-time writers either to pay the costs of
          printing themselves, with the bookseller/publisher handling distribution, or to publish by subscription. That this was not the case with
            <title>The Farmer’s Boy</title> must have been a result of Lofft’s strategy of showing the poem to Hill, an experienced editor of magazine
          verse with influence over a publishing house. Hill’s imprimatur assured Vernor and Hood that it would find a sale sufficient to repay their
          costs – not least because it could be puffed in the magazines they also published and in which Hill and Lofft reviewed. It was a bargain
          that Bloomfield, advised by <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#SwanJames">James Swan</ref> (d. 1818), a London printer, accepted at a
          meeting with Hood.</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">What Hood published on 1 March 1800 was not quite the manuscript as submitted by George Bloomfield to Lofft in 1798. Lofft
          took it upon himself to revise what he read, as he noted in his Preface to the first edition:</p>
        <quote>My part has been this, and it has been a very pleasing one: to revise the MS. Making occasionally corrections with respect to
          Orthography, and sometimes in the grammatical construction. The corrections, in point of Grammar, reduce themselves almost wholly to a
          circumstance of provincial usage, which even well educated persons in Suffolk and Norfolk do not wholly avoid; and which may be said, as to
          general custom, to have become in these Counties almost an established Dialect:…that of adopting the plural for the singular termination of
          verbs, so as to exclude the s. But not a line is added or substantially alter’d through the whole Poem. (Preface)</quote>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">As Peter Cochran has pointed out,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Farmer’s Boy by Robert Bloomfield: A
              Parallel Text Edition</title>, ed. Peter Cochran (Newcastle upon Tyne, 2014), p. 19.</note> Lofft’s final
          sentence here was not quite correct. In fact, he did alter phrases that he found too colloquial or too earthy, in favour of a more
          conventional and polite language. The effect of these changes was to make the poem more ‘tasteful’, more detached from the labouring-class
          locutions, and more generic (because its language was deracinated from the language community of rural Suffolk). Although these changes were
          not extensive, Bloomfield himself having largely mastered the gentlemanly style of his model James Thomson, they were significant. In <hi
            rend="ital">Summer</hi>, for example, Bloomfield’s focus on the ‘writhing loins’ of the ‘sturdy Mower’ proved all too close-up: Lofft
          changed ‘loins’ to ‘form’ (142–3). In <hi rend="ital">Autumn</hi> Bloomfield’s description of the mad girl who left her cottage each night
          ‘in filth to lie, / Where the swine grunting yields up half his sty’ became ‘unhous’d to lie, / Or share the swine’s impure and narrow sty’
          (136–8). Lofft’s farm was to have no hint of sex or shit about it.</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Whether Bloomfield knew of these changes while the work was in production, is unclear, for he did not supervise the printing
          (by Thomas Bensley, who would print all of the first six editions), and relied on the press to discover details about the forthcoming
          volume. In a letter to George of 8 September–6 October 1799 (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.16.html">Letter 16</ref>), he noted</p>
        <quote>I shall see in what manner the Farmer’s Boy is advertised, not in the papers but on the covers of the monthly publications from that

          received a copy—perhaps from Lofft—before the humble author and was impressed enough to want to patronise him. He gave Bloomfield a five
          pound note and invited him to stay at his country estate in Northamptonshire. For his part, Bloomfield looked over the Duke’s luxury

            series 15 (1993), 75–94.</note> and encountered, for the first time, the Preface that Lofft had added to the verse. This told Bloomfield’s
          life story using information provided by George, emphasising his rural naivety and natural gentility. It prepared bookbuyers to encounter a
          work of natural genius achieved by a sensitive, humble family man: Bloomfield, it showed, was not an uncouth ale-drinking farmhand and nor
          was he a radicalised artisan (thus banishing the spectres of the democrat campaigners Thomas Paine, a corsetmaker born near Bloomfield in
          Norfolk, and Thomas Hardy, like Bloomfield a London shoemaker, tried for treason in 1794). It also incorporated the praise of several literary gentleman, assuring the upper and middle-classes who were the poem’s likely
          purchasers that it would meet their taste. This was an early use of the marketing technique of name recognition. Lofft’s prefatory framing
          patronised Bloomfield, but thereby made him suitable both for aristocratic patrons who wished to reward natural genius from their regions
          and for middle-class patrons of booksellers’ shops who could support him by buying the poem. It left Bloomfield embarrassed, however,
          because it put his private life on parade and used the rural simplicity that he had shown when he first came to London as a boy to define
          his character as a man. </p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Lofft’s publicity strategy worked: the reviews followed the lead of the Preface, agreeing that the poet was ‘the untutored
          bard, who paints, and paints vividly, from nature’,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Anti-Jacobin Review and Magazine</title>,
            6 (1800), 435–38 (p. 438).</note> that the verse abounded with ‘beautiful lines of accurate and minute description’<note n="6"
            place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Critical Review</title>, 29 (1800), 66–77 (p. 70).</note> and a ‘harmony of numbers which could not be

          They relayed the story of Bloomfield’s deserving life. In doing so, they were responding to Lofft’s presentation of the poet, and also to
          Bloomfield’s own choice of a child narrator, highly unusual for a locodescriptive and Georgic poem in the Thomsonian tradition. Instead of
          Thomson’s disembodied, distant narrator, Bloomfield chose not simply a farmworker, as in Stephen Duck’s and Mary Collier’s labouring-class
          revisions of the Georgic tradition, but a boy. This choice gave him a narrator who could be present without being wholly involved in the
          grown-up world he witnessed—as if an unobserved observer. In the gap between the adult writer and his boy narrator, and between the boy and
          the adults within the poem, distance, loneliness and pathos enter. This is not the pathos of time having past—the Wordsworthian lost hour of
          splendour in the grass that the <title>Prelude</title> was written to record and redeem (the temporal distance between the urban, adult
          author and the rural, child narrator was fundamental to Bloomfield’s writing but is not explicitly discussed). It is more a matter of a
          certain alienation in situ: unlike Duck, who conveyed rural life directly to the reader as a man’s personal and collective experience of
          labour, Bloomfield’s boy stands at a remove, looking on. He is not quite one of the lads and certainly not a man, and when he speaks of work
          with the authority born of experience he does so not to challenge the poetic idealisations that depict peasants as fortunate sons of the
          soil who are contented in their labour, but to record his misery and fear when tasked with spending hour after hour alone in the field
          scaring crows. Rural labour, this implies, can be isolating and soul destroying even if not backbreaking. Unlike the ploughmen and the
          threshers, or the milkmaids and the washerwomen, the boy does not get to be one of a team that communally takes pride in its strength, skill
          and usefulness. Thus part of the poem’s appeal lay in its narrator’s ability to mobilise pity, whereas an adult narrator might have raised
          awkward issues of class difference, seeming either obsequious or truculent—anxious to soothe or keen to shock the feelings of a polite
          reader brought face to face with the uncouth farmyard and the uncouth bodies—human and animal—that it places side by side in the muck.</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The public’s sympathies were engaged and it began to buy the poem in larger numbers than anyone expected, making Bloomfield
          the first publishing sensation of the nineteenth-century mass-market press. Vernor and Hood astutely catered to different income levels,
          selling <title>The Farmer’s Boy</title> in large quartos on fine Whatman paper for the wealthy, in quartos (at half a guinea), and in
          smaller octavos for those with more modest means. The book’s success, then, owed much to commercial acumen on its editors’ and publishers’
          parts. Second and third editions followed later in 1800, in cheaper demi octavo and octavo sizes. In the third, Lofft made a major addition
          to the paratextual material that would turn out to have severe consequences for his relationship with the poem and its author. He added an
          appendix in which he complained at length about his having been removed from his role as a justice of the peace on the grounds, he
          suspected, of his radical politics. The removal had little or nothing to do with Bloomfield’s poem; the appendix therefore did nothing more
          than reveal Lofft’s egotism and his proprietorial attitude towards the work he had brought to public attention. <title>The Farmer’s
            Boy</title> was, the appendix suggested, a place for Lofft to parade his goodwill and air his grievances. It was his, the patron’s, work
          almost as much as that of Bloomfield, who was his client and was to be approached through him, his verse bracketed by Lofft’s prose.</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The Appendix distressed Bloomfield and the publisher, Hood, because it put Lofft’s personal affairs between the poet and the
          reader, and introduced contentious political matters to a volume they had tried to keep free of radicalism so as not to alarm reviewers and
          purchasers. In the fifth edition (1801), they persuaded Lofft to add this note exculpating Bloomfield: </p>
        <quote>I wish it to be understood, that neither for my political Sentiments, Opinions, and Conduct, nor for any thing which I have said that
          personally concerns myself in the introductory part of this <hi rend="ital">Appendix</hi>, is Mr. <hi rend="smcaps">Bloomfield</hi> in the smallest degree
          responsible. Those therefore who dislike either the sentiments or the mode of expression must, in mere justice, impute them to me alone, and
          in no respect as any way implicating him. He wishes, I believe, to decline <hi rend="ital">Politics</hi> and <hi rend="ital"
            >Controversy</hi> altogether; and I wish no man to mix in either farther than he feels it to be a Duty.</quote>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">A tension was now evident: the power relations of patron and client did not harmonise with those of editor and author.
          Lofft’s underlying conception of what and who the publication was for (fellow Suffolk gentlefolk who bought the book so as to support worthy
          local causes) was at odds with Hood’s eye on the wider reading public, whom he supposed to want uncontroversial pastoral pleasure. The split
          became wider in October 1801, as Vernor and Hood prepared a sixth edition. Hill and Hood pressured Bloomfield to gain Lofft’s consent to
          drop the appendix (Lofft having by this point been restored to the bench). They also desired the removal of a note approving of the debating
          societies that, anti-Jacobins believed, were hotbeds of labouring class radicalism. Lofft’s reply to the request, Bloomfield reported, made
          it clear that ‘The infalible result of any inovation <hi rend="ital">now</hi> made in “the Farmer’s Boy”, would infix in the mind of Mr L
          the deepest and the most rooted dislike to me’ (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.69.html"
            >Letter 69</ref>; see also letters <ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.63.html">63</ref>,

            target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.67.html">67</ref>). Lofft let him know that if the cuts were
          made he would ensure Bloomfield became known as an ingrate: Bloomfield, having so little social status, could not risk appearing thus to the
          gentlemen and aristocrats who had supported the work, and was left pleading with Hill and Hood to leave the appendix and the note in place.
          Caught between patron and publisher, Bloomfield found himself to be the property of others (Hood retained half the copyright)—his case a
          symptom of the changes produced by the rapid expansion of the book market and the concomitant diminution of the role of patron and rise of
          that of the bookseller. Although Bloomfield’s plea worked, and Lofft’s embarrassing grandstanding was left in place in the sixth and seventh
          editions, printed by James Swan (1802 and 1803), the difficulty was not resolved. By 1803 he and Lofft were estranged, Lofft having been
          offended by the removal of his footnotes commenting on the poems in Bloomfield’s second collection <title>Rural Tales</title> (1802). In the
          eighth edition, of 1805, Lofft’s insertions concerning debating societies, concerning his tenure on the bench, and concerning his marriage
          were removed; Lofft’s voice presenting the biographical account of Bloomfield’s early life was replaced by Bloomfield’s own; some of the
          flattering commentary on the poem by Lofft’s friends was deleted. Bloomfield did call another literary gentleman to his aid, including in
          the edition a list compiled by <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#ParkThomas">Thomas Park</ref> (1759–1834; an editor and antiquarian) of
          all the alterations that Lofft had, in 1799, made to the manuscript of the poem. The aim, apparently, was not just to strip Lofft from the
          paratext, but also to chart what he had done to the text. As a result, Lofft’s words no longer prepared the reader to encounter the boyish
          rustic poet: that poet appeared as an intelligent, straightforward man speaking to men (he had by then read Wordsworth’s preface to that
          relatively poorly-selling collection of rural poems, <title>Lyrical Ballads</title>). </p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The tussle was not over: in the ninth edition (1806) Lofft reasserted himself, adding notes indicating his displeasure at
          the omission of his words from the eighth and again delivering his political opinions. After an earlier remark regretting the restriction of
          newspapers and popular print was dropped, Lofft now added ‘I spoke in the former Editions of the effect of <hi rend="ital">Newspapers</hi>,
          and other means of popular Information; and I now say, I have no doubt that the opportunity of reading them contributed much to form the
          mind of the Author of the <hi rend="ital">Farmer’s Boy</hi>. Genius profits greatly by small daily aids and excitements. A wise and good
          Government will render those aids as free and as generally accessible as it can. From such sparks not only the spirit of the former <hi
            rend="ital">Poet</hi>, but of the Artist in various branches, of the future sailor and soldier is awakened’. He also added a new note
          endorsing debating societies, after his former one was excised, and occasional snide comments such as ‘Mr. Bloomfield having omitted in the
          eighth Edition what I had said in the seventh, of the satisfaction I had in 1800 in being made personally acquainted with him here at <hi
            rend="ital">Troston</hi>, I shall not restore it against his will’. Thus the struggle for supervision of Bloomfield’s verse and biography,
          and, still more, the resentment of poet and publisher by patron, was made apparent to all readers. Lofft’s remarks remained in later
          lifetime stand-alone editions of the poem (1808, 1810, 1811, 1815, 1820): he had, it might seem, the last (and first) word.</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Not so: in 1809 the <title>Poems of Robert Bloomfield</title> was published – a collection of all the poet’s major
          publications to that date. Produced by the new stereotype method, so that it could be reissued again and again without the need to set up
          new type, this collected edition was supervised by Bloomfield himself, and featured a <hi rend="ital">Farmer’s Boy</hi> from which Lofft’s
          voice was largely excised. For the first time, Lofft’s 1799 alterations of the verse were largely removed in favour of what Bloomfield had
          written in the original MS. Poem as well as preface was now in Bloomfield’s words, and these words were plainer and more colloquial than
          anything previously published in his name. For example, in the first edition the phrase about mud, ‘Till dirt usurp the empire of his
          shoes’, became ‘dirt adhesive loads his clouted shoes’ (<hi rend="ital">Spring</hi> 82)—’clouted’ smacking of Suffolk rustic speech. The
          ‘shepherd idling’ became the ‘idling shepherd’ (<hi rend="ital">Spring</hi> 281)—the poetic inversion gone. The phrase about the sheep
          longing for familiar fields, ‘Instinctively they haunt the homeward gate’ was changed to ‘Bleating around the homeward gate they meet’ (<hi
            rend="ital">Spring</hi> 297). Since the stereotype edition was reissued in 1814, 1817 and 1821 there were effectively two competing
          versions of <title>The Farmer’s Boy</title> in circulation, vividly demonstrating the contested status of the poem and the inability of a
          labouring-class author, even when supported by his publisher, to extricate himself from a gentleman patron.</p>

        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The extra payment of £100 for the first six editions, Bloomfield regarded as generous. But the profits were large.
          Bloomfield told his brother on 30 November 1801 that ‘The 5th and 6th edition of Giles comprize together 10,000 copies, the new work
            [<title>Rural Tales</title>] 7,000, so that I have at any rate to share the profits of 17,000 books, for which (at full price) the
          publick, if they are goodnaturd enough to buy them, will pay no less than £36,025!’ (<ref
            target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.70.html">Letter 70</ref>). The ninth edition, printed by
          William Wilson (as were the tenth and eleventh) was of 4000 copies. This brought the total printed to 26100. This success was important to
          Vernor and Hood, but they nonetheless faced increasing financial difficulties and from the sixth edition of 1802 divided their half share of
          the profits equally with <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#LongmanThomasN">Longman</ref>, Hurst, Rees, and Orme (this arrangement was still
          in operation for the twelfth edition of 1811). In 1812, after Hood’s death, the firm failed and the surviving partner, <ref type="m"
            target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#SharpeC">C. Sharpe</ref>, sold off his share in the poem to <ref type="m" target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#CrosbyBenjamin">B.
            Crosby</ref> and Co, and unloaded 4500 unsold copies of Bloomfield’s publications at a discount (thus reducing the value of Bloomfield’s
          half-share of the profits and making the volumes inaccessible to him). The bankruptcy, and Sharpe’s death soon afterwards, meant that
          Bloomfield, as one of many creditors, received only 4s 6d for each pound of the £372, 12s and 4d owed him in royalties (23%: and this to be
          staggered into four payments stretching from 1813 to 1816). He took legal advice from Lofft and from the eminent Whig lawyer Samuel Romilly
          and discovered that copyright for the poem would revert to him, if living, fourteen years after first publication. He hoped that this would
          be worth ‘not less than £2000’ (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.273.html">Letter
          273</ref>). The reversion occurred in March 1814, and he then sold to London publishers a half share in the copyright for the next fourteen
          years, though obtaining only ‘about half the sum which I suppose their chance is worth’ (<ref
            target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.294.html">Letter 294</ref>). The publishers’ half share was
          in turn divided, so that the risk was spread across several firms. Thus in 1815 the thirteenth edition, printed by Samuel Hamilton in
          Weybridge, was published by a group of booksellers in which Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown took the lead. Both for these editions and
          for the 1814, 1820 and 1821 stereotype editions of the <title>Poems of Robert Bloomfield</title> Bloomfield kept a half share in the
          profits; a quarter was held by Longmans, while the remaining quarter was divided between several booksellers (Crosby was named among them
          for the 1814 <title>Poems</title> only—and went bankrupt in that year of recession in the book trade). Of these <ref type="m"
            target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/people.html#BaldwinRobert">Baldwin</ref>, Cradock and Joy took responsibility for printing, distribution and payment of royalties
          (see <ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.310.html">Letter 310</ref> and <ref
            target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.350.html">Letter 350</ref>). They printed 2000 copies of the
          fourteenth edition of <title>The Farmer’s Boy</title> (1820) and 2000 of the 1821 <title>Poems</title>.</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The poem was popular enough for editions to be published beyond the reach of British copyright law. There were two editions
          in New York, and others in Philadelphia and Leipzig, in 1801; in 1802 an edition was published in Dublin; in 1803 editions appeared in New
          York, Dublin and Baltimore; further editions came out in Paris in 1804; and in Albany, N.Y., in 1814. After copyright expired in 1828, the
          poem, either alone or combined with editions of other out-of-copyright works by Bloomfield, was frequently published, throughout the
          nineteenth century. B. C. Bloomfield reveals that ‘The firm of Milner, for instance, under its various names and in its various series, sold
          65,550 copies of Bloomfield between 1835 and 1895, and he was fifth in popularity, as measured by sales, during that period. The figures
          are:</p>

        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">followed by, in descending order of sales, Longfellow, Moore, Cowper, Wordsworth, Shelley, Dryden, Scott, Hemans, Thomson,

        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">This Edition</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">This edition is the first ever to collate all the lifetime editions of the poem. It also collates the manuscript that
          Bloomfield wrote out from memory in 1801 (Houghton Library Eng fMS 776.1) in an effort to recreate the original manuscript that in 1798 he
          had sent to George Bloomfield, who had passed it to Lofft who emended it and sent it to Thomas Hill and thence to press (now Houghton
          Library Eng fMS 776). The press set up type from this original manuscript, and it was then kept by Hill and not returned to Bloomfield, who
          was thus left without a manuscript of his own poem—hence the need to write out a new one from memory, one free of Lofft’s emendations that
          had made their way into the first published edition (1800). Bloomfield explained his reasons for creating a new manuscript in a letter of 30
          November 1801 (<ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.70.html">Letter 70</ref>): ‘I am writing a
          fair copy of the Farmer’s Boy exactly as you saw it in MS., and marking the alterations made by Mr Lofft; and adding notes of information,
          &amp;c., this I do that as I have not the original, something in <hi rend="ital">my own hand</hi> may be found hereafter, and I do it
          too to improve my handwriting: I shall have it bound carefully’. By collating this manuscript (fMS 776.1) and all the lifetime editions, and
          displaying variants, it is for the first time possible to trace the many alterations made to the poem and its paratext as a result of the
          growing tensions between Bloomfield, Lofft and the publishers Vernor and Hood. We display, in effect, the history of <title>The Farmer’s
            Boy</title> as a battleground between parties seeking success and authority with an expanded literary public shaped by a commercial book
          market.</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">While our copytext is the 1800 first edition, on the grounds it was this that gave the poem its major public impact, it is
          possible to trace the Lofftian emendations that the 1800 edition made to the original manuscript by examining the variants. Lofft’s
          additional remarks in successive editions of the Preface and Appendix, and in notes, are now traceable; so are the prunings of these remarks
          in the eighth edition, and Lofft’s responses to these prunings in the ninth and subsequent editions. The text and paratext as brought under
          Bloomfield’s control, with much of Lofft’s input excised, in the 1809, 1814, 1817 and 1821 stereotype <title>Poems of Robert
            Bloomfield</title> is also recorded in variants. </p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">Manuscripts</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">The Houghton Library, Harvard University, holds two manuscripts of the poem. </p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">fMS Eng 776 is the manuscript sent by Bloomfield to George, and taken by George to Lofft, in 1798. It was then transmitted
          to Thomas Hill, who kept it after its use by the printer. A fair copy of the whole poem, it contains emendations in pen and pencil
          identified by Bloomfield as the work of Lofft. </p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">MS Eng 776.1 is from 1801. It has no line-numbers, and is of white, laid paper, of higher quality than fMS Eng 776,
          measuring 31 x 19cm. It begins with an explanation: </p>
        <quote>City Road, London. Octr 8th 1801. The Original Manuscript of my ‘Farmer’s Boy’ is not likely ever to be in my possession again; it
          being left, by Mr Lofft’s desire, in the hands of T Hill Esq. of Henrietta Street Covent Garden; where it now remains; except about two
          hundred and Sixty lines of the commencement of the Poem which are lost. Wishing to possess a Manuscript like the Original, I meen that the
          right hand page of this Book shall contain a genuine Copy of the Poem As I wrote it at first; and that the left hand page shall shew the
          amendments and alterations introduced by Mr Lofft. This I can do now while my memory retains the deviations; but, some years hence, I may
          not be able, and may then wish that I had done it when it was in my power. Robert Bloomfield</quote>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent0">Lofft’s verbal emendations of the original, 1798, manuscript are entered on the verso, together with several notes, and
          Bloomfield’s reconstitution from memory of the original manuscript is written out on the recto.</p>
