               <div class="indent3">Darkness unusual overspread their home;</div>
               <div class="indent3">A chilling blast was felt; the foremost cloud</div>

               <div class="indent3">Though distant yet, menac’d the country round,</div>
               <div class="indent3">And fill’d the Heavens with its solemn sound.</div>
               <div class="indent3">Who can retire to rest when tempests lour?</div>

               <div class="indent3">He fill’d his pipe, and listen’d to the rain</div>
               <div class="indent3">That batter’d furiously their strong abode,</div>
               <div class="indent3">Roar’d in the Damm, and lash’d the pebbled road:</div>
               <div class="indent3">When, mingling with the storm, confus’d and wild,</div>
               <div class="indent3">They heard, or thought they heard, a screaming <span class="ital">Child</span>:<span class="lineNumber">20</span></div>

               <div class="indent3">Whilst the cold rain dripp’d from her in a flood.</div>
               <div class="indent3">With kind officiousness the tender Dame</div>
               <div class="indent3">Rous’d up the dying embers to a flame;</div>

               <div class="indent3">What marks of cruel usage shock’d their sight!</div>
               <div class="indent3">Weals, and blue wounds, most piteous to behold</div>
               <div class="indent3">Upon a Child yet scarcely Ten years old.</div>
               <div class="indent4">The <span class="ital">Miller</span> felt his indignation rise,<span class="lineNumber">35</span></div>
               <div class="indent3">Yet, as the weary stranger clos’d her eyes,</div>

               <div class="indent3">‘See, fluttering sighs that rise against her will,</div>
               <div class="indent3">And agitating dreams disturb her still!</div>
               <div class="indent3">Dame, we should know before we go to rest,</div>
               <div class="indent3">Whence comes this Girl, and how she came distrest.</div>
               <div class="indent3">Wake her, and ask; for she is sorely bruis’d:<span class="lineNumber">45</span></div>
               <div class="indent3">I long to know by whom she’s thus misus’d.’</div>
               <div class="indent4">‘Child, what’s your name? how came you in the storm?</div>
               <div class="indent3">Have you no home to keep you dry and warm?</div>
               <div class="indent3">Who gave you all those wounds your shoulders show?</div>
               <div class="indent3">Where are your Parents? Whither would you go?’<span class="lineNumber">50</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">The Stranger bursting into tears, look’d pale,</div>
               <div class="indent3">And this the purport of her artless tale.</div>
               <div class="indent4">‘I have no Parents; and no friends beside:</div>
               <div class="indent3">I well remember when my Mother died:</div>
               <div class="indent3">My Brother cried; and so did I that day:<span class="lineNumber">55</span></div>
               <div class="indent3">We had no Father;—he was gone away;</div>
               <div class="indent3">That night we left our home new cloaths to wear:</div>
               <div class="indent3">The <span class="ital">Work-house</span> found them; we were carried there.</div>
               <div class="indent3">We lov’d each other dearly; when we met</div>
               <div class="indent3">We always shar’d what trifles we could get.<span class="lineNumber">60</span></div>
               <div class="indent3">But <span class="ital">George</span> was older by a year than me:—</div>
               <div class="indent3">He parted from me and was sent to Sea.</div>
               <div class="indent3">“Good-bye, dear Phoebe,” the poor fellow said!</div>
               <div class="indent3">Perhaps he’ll come again; perhaps he’s dead.</div>
               <div class="indent3">When I grew strong enough I went to place,<span class="lineNumber">65</span></div>
               <div class="indent3">My Mistress had a sour ill-natured face;</div>
               <div class="indent3">And though I’ve been so often beat and chid,</div>
               <div class="indent3">I strove to please her, Sir; indeed, I did.</div>
               <div class="indent3">Weary and spiritless to bed I crept,</div>
               <div class="indent3">And always cried at night before I slept.<span class="lineNumber">70</span></div>
               <div class="indent3">This Morning I offended; and I bore</div>
               <div class="indent3">A cruel beating, worse than all before.</div>
               <div class="indent3">Unknown to all the House I ran away;</div>
               <div class="indent3">And thus far travell’d through the sultry day;</div>
               <div class="indent3">And, O don’t send me back! I dare not go—.’<span class="lineNumber">75</span></div>
               <div class="indent3">‘I send you back!’ (the Miller cried), ‘no, no.’</div>
               <div class="indent3">Th’ appeals of Wretchedness had weight with him,</div>
               <div class="indent3">And Sympathy would warm him every limb;</div>
               <div class="indent3">He mutter’d, glorying in the work begun,</div>
               <div class="indent3">‘Well done, my little Wench; ’twas nobly done!’<span class="lineNumber">80</span></div>
               <div class="indent3">Then said, with looks more cheering than the fire,</div>
               <div class="indent3">And feelings such as Pity can inspire,</div>
               <div class="indent3">‘My house has childless been this many a year;</div>
               <div class="indent3">While you deserve it you shall tarry here.’</div>
               <div class="indent3">The Orphan mark’d the ardor of his eye,<span class="lineNumber">85</span></div>
               <div class="indent3">Blest his kind words, and thank’d him with a sigh.</div>
               <div class="indent4">Thus was the sacred compact doubly seal’d;</div>
               <div class="indent3">Thus were her spirits rais’d, her bruises heal’d:</div>
               <div class="indent3">Thankful, and cheerful too, no more afraid,</div>
               <div class="indent3">Thus little <span class="smcaps">Phoebe</span> was the Miller’s Maid.<span class="lineNumber">90</span></div>
               <div class="indent3">Grateful they found her; patient of controul:</div>
               <div class="indent3">A most bewitching gentleness of soul</div>
               <div class="indent3">Made pleasure of what work she had to do:</div>
               <div class="indent3">She grew in stature, and in beauty too.</div>
               <div class="indent3">Five years she pass’d in this delightful home;<span class="lineNumber">95</span></div>
               <div class="indent3">Five happy years: but, when the sixth was come,</div>
               <div class="indent3">The <span class="ital">Miller</span> from a Market Town hard by,</div>
               <div class="indent3">Brought home a sturdy Youth his strength to try,</div>
               <div class="indent3">To raise the sluice-gates early every morn,</div>
               <div class="indent3">To heave his powder’d sacks and grind his corn:<span class="lineNumber">100</span></div>
               <div class="indent3">And meeting <span class="ital">Phoebe</span>, whom he lov’d so dear,</div>
               <div class="indent3">‘I’ve brought you home a Husband, Girl?—D’ye hear?</div>
               <div class="indent3">He begg’d for work; his money seem’d but scant:</div>
               <div class="indent3">Those that will work ’tis pity they should want.

               <div class="indent3">When Love he mention’d;—Love, and Honour true,</div>
               <div class="indent3">But <span class="ital">Phoebe</span> still was shy; and wish’d to know</div>
               <div class="indent3">More of the honest Youth, whose manly brow</div>

               <div class="indent3">Tidings to gain of her who once was dear;</div>
               <div class="indent3">A Girl, with all the meekness of the dove,</div>
               <div class="indent3">The constant sharer of my childhood’s love;</div>
               <div class="indent3">She call’d me <span class="ital">Brother</span>:—which I heard with pride,<span class="lineNumber">165</span></div>
               <div class="indent3">Though now suspect we are not so allied.</div>
