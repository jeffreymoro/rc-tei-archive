               <h1><span class="noCount">THE SHEPHERD’S DREAM: OR, FAIRIES’ MASQUERADE</span></h1>
            </header>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="indent4"><span class="smcaps">I had</span> folded my flock, and my heart was o’erflowing,</div>
               <div class="indent4">I loiter’d beside the small lake on the heath;</div>
               <div class="indent4">The red sun, though down, left his drapery glowing,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And no sound was stirring, I heard not a breath:</div>
               <div class="indent4">I sat on the turf, but I meant not to sleep, <span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">And gazed o’er that lake which for ever is new,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Where clouds over clouds appear’d anxious to peep</div>
               <div class="indent4">From this bright double sky with its pearl and its blue.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="indent4">Forgetfulness, rather than slumber, it seem’d,</div>
               <div class="indent4">When in infinite thousands the fairies arose<span class="lineNumber">10</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">All over the heath, and their tiny crests gleam’d</div>
               <div class="indent4">In mock’ry of soldiers, our friends and our foes.</div>
               <div class="indent4">There a stripling went forth, half a finger’s length high,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And led a huge host to the north with a dash;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Silver birds upon poles went before their wild cry, <span class="lineNumber">15</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">While the monarch look’d forward, adjusting his sash.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="indent4">Soon after a terrible bonfire was seen,</div>
               <div class="indent4">The dwellings of fairies went down in their ire,</div>
               <div class="indent4">But from all I remember, I never could glean</div>
               <div class="indent4">Why the woodstack was burnt, or who set it on fire.<span class="lineNumber">20</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">The flames seem’d to rise o’er a deluge of snow,</div>
               <div class="indent4">That buried its thousands,—the rest ran away;</div>
               <div class="indent4">For the hero had here overstrain’d his long bow,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Yet he honestly own’d the mishap of the day.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="indent4">Then the fays of the north like a hailstorm came on, <span class="lineNumber">25</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">And follow’d him down to the lake in a riot,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Where they found a large stone which they fix’d him upon,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And threaten’d, and coax’d him, and bade him be quiet.</div>
               <div class="indent4">He that conquer’d them all, was to conquer no more,</div>
               <div class="indent4">But the million beheld he could conquer alone;<span class="lineNumber">30</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">After resting awhile, he leap’d boldly on shore,</div>
               <div class="indent4">When away ran a fay that had mounted his throne.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="indent4">’Twas pleasant to see how they stared, how they scamper’d,</div>
               <div class="indent4">By furze-bush, by fern, by no obstacle stay’d,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And the few that held council, were terribly hamper’d, <span class="lineNumber">35</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">For some were vindictive, and some were afraid.</div>
               <div class="indent4">I saw they were dress’d for a masquerade train,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Colour’d rags upon sticks they all brandish’d in view,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And of such idle things they seem’d mightily vain,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Though they nothing display’d but a bird split in two.<span class="lineNumber">40</span></div>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="indent4">Then out rush’d the stripling in battle array,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And both sides determined to fight and to maul:</div>
               <div class="indent4">Death rattled his jawbones to see such a fray,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And glory personified laugh’d at them all.</div>
               <div class="indent4">Here he fail’d,—hence he fled, with a few for his sake, <span class="lineNumber">45</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">And leap’d into a cockle-shell floating hard by;</div>
               <div class="indent4">It sail’d to an isle in the midst of the lake,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Where they mock’d fallen greatness, and left him to die.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="indent4">Meanwhile the north fairies stood round in a ring,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Supporting his rival on guns and on spears,<span class="lineNumber">50</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Who, though not a soldier, was robed like a king;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Yet some were exulting, and some were in tears.</div>
               <div class="indent4">A lily triumphantly floated above,</div>
               <div class="indent4">The crowd press’d, and wrangling was heard through the whole;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Some soldiers look’d surly, some citizens strove <span class="lineNumber">55</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">To hoist the old nightcap on liberty’s pole.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="indent4">But methought in my dream some bewail’d him that fell,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And liked not his victors so gallant, so clever,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Till a fairy stepp’d forward, and blew through a shell,</div>
               <div class="indent4">‘Bear misfortune with firmness, you’ll triumph for ever.’<span class="lineNumber">60</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">I woke at the sound, all in silence, alone,</div>
               <div class="indent4">The moor-hens were floating like specks on a glass,</div>
               <div class="indent4">The dun clouds were spreading, the vision was gone,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And my dog scamper’d round ’midst the dew on the grass.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="indent4">I took up my staff, as a knight would his lance, <span class="lineNumber">65</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">And said, ‘Here’s my sceptre, my baton, my spear,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And there’s my prime minister far in advance,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Who serves me with truth for his food by the year.’</div>
               <div class="indent4">So I slept without care till the dawning of day,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Then trimm’d up my woodbines and whistled amain;<span class="lineNumber">70</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">My minister heard as he bounded away,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And we led forth our sheep to their pastures again.</div>
