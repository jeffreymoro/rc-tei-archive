               <div class="indent4"><span class="smcaps">Yes</span>, let me tell of Jennet, my last child;</div>
               <div class="indent4">In her the charms of all the rest ran wild,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And sprouted as they pleased. Still by my side,</div>
               <div class="indent4">I own she was my favourite, was my pride, </div>
               <div class="indent4">Since first she labour’d round my neck to twine,<span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Or clasp’d both little hands in one of mine:</div>
               <div class="indent4">And when the season broke, I’ve seen her bring</div>
               <div class="indent4">Lapfuls of flowers, and then the girl would sing</div>
               <div class="indent4">Whole songs, and halves, and bits, O, with such glee!</div>
               <div class="indent4">If playmates found a favourite, it was she.<span class="lineNumber">10</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Her lively spirit lifted her to joy;</div>
               <div class="indent4">To distance in the race a clumsy boy</div>
               <div class="indent4">Would raise the flush of conquest in her eye,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And all was dance, and laugh, and liberty.</div>
               <div class="indent4">Yet not hard-hearted, take me right, I beg,<span class="lineNumber">15</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">The veriest romp that ever wagg’d a leg</div>
               <div class="indent4">Was Jennet; but when pity soothed her mind,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Prompt with her tears, and delicately kind.</div>
               <div class="indent4">The half-fledged nestling, rabbit, mouse, or dove, </div>
               <div class="indent4">By turns engaged her cares and infant love;<span class="lineNumber">20</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">And many a one, at the last doubtful strife,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Warm’d in her bosom, started into life.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="indent4">At thirteen she was all that Heaven could send,</div>
               <div class="indent4">My nurse, my faithful clerk, my lively friend;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Last at my pillow when I sunk to sleep,<span class="lineNumber">25</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">First on my threshold soon as day could peep:</div>
               <div class="indent4">I heard her happy to her heart’s desire,</div>
               <div class="indent4">With clanking pattens, and a roaring fire.</div>
               <div class="indent4">Then, having store of new-laid eggs to spare, </div>
               <div class="indent4">She fill’d her basket with the simple fare,<span class="lineNumber">30</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">And weekly trudged (I think I see her still)</div>
               <div class="indent4">To sell them at yon house upon the hill.</div>
               <div class="indent4">Oft have I watch’d her as she stroll’d along,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Heard the gate bang, and heard her morning song;</div>
               <div class="indent4">And, as my warm ungovern’d feelings rose,<span class="lineNumber">35</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Said to myself, ‘Heaven bless her! there she goes.’</div>
               <div class="indent4">Long would she tarry, and then dancing home,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Tell how the lady bade her oft’ner come,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And bade her talk and laugh without control;</div>
               <div class="indent4">For Jennet’s voice was music to the soul,<span class="lineNumber">40</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">My tale shall prove it:—For there dwelt a son,</div>
               <div class="indent4">An only child, and where there is but one,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Indulgence like a mildew reigns, from whence</div>
               <div class="indent4">Mischief may follow if that child wants sense. </div>
               <div class="indent4">But Alfred was a youth of noble mind,<span class="lineNumber">45</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">With ardent passions, and with taste refined:</div>
               <div class="indent4">All that could please still courted heart and hand,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Music, joy, peace, and wealth, at his command;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Wealth, which his widow’d mother deem’d his own;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Except the poor, she lived for him alone.<span class="lineNumber">50</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Yet would she weep by stealth when he was near,</div>
               <div class="indent4">But check’d all sighs to spare his wounded ear;</div>
               <div class="indent4">For from his cradle he had never seen</div>
               <div class="indent4">Soul-cheering sunbeams, or wild nature’s green. </div>
               <div class="indent4">But all life’s blessings centre not in sight;<span class="lineNumber">55</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">For Providence, that dealt him one long night,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Had given, in pity to the blooming boy,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Feelings more exquisitely tuned to joy.</div>
               <div class="indent4">Fond to excess was he of all that grew;</div>
               <div class="indent4">The morning blossom sprinkled o’er with dew,<span class="lineNumber">60</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Across his path, as if in playful freak,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Would dash his brow, and weep upon his cheek;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Each varying leaf that brush’d where’er he came,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Press’d to his rosy lip he call’d by name; </div>
               <div class="indent4">He grasp’d the saplings, measured every bough,<span class="lineNumber">65</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Inhaled the fragrance that the spring months throw</div>
               <div class="indent4">Profusely round, till his young heart confess’d</div>
               <div class="indent4">That all was beauty, and himself was bless’d.</div>
               <div class="indent4">Yet when he traced the wide extended plain, </div>
               <div class="indent4">Or clear brook side, he felt a transient pain;<span class="lineNumber">70</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">The keen regret of goodness, void of pride,</div>
               <div class="indent4">To think he could not roam without a guide.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="indent4">Who, guess ye, knew these scenes of home delight</div>
               <div class="indent4">Better than Jennet, bless’d with health and sight? </div>
               <div class="indent4">Whene’er she came, he from his sports would slide,<span class="lineNumber">75</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">And catch her wild laugh, listening by her side;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Mount to the tell-tale clock with ardent spring,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And <span class="ital">feel </span>the passing hour, then fondly cling</div>
               <div class="indent4">To Jennet’s arm, and tell how sweet the breath </div>
               <div class="indent4">Of bright May-mornings on the open heath;<span class="lineNumber">80</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Then off they started, rambling far and wide,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Like Cupid with a wood-nymph by his side.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="indent4">Thus months and months roll’d on, the summer pass’d,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And the long darkness, and the winter blast, </div>
               <div class="indent4">Sever’d the pair; no flowery fields to roam,<span class="lineNumber">85</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Poor Alfred sought his music and his home.</div>
               <div class="indent4">What wonder then if inwardly he pined?</div>
               <div class="indent4">The anxious mother mark’d her stripling’s mind</div>
               <div class="indent4">Gloomy and sad, yet striving to be gay </div>
               <div class="indent4">As the long tedious evenings pass’d away:<span class="lineNumber">90</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">’Twas her delight fresh spirits to supply.—</div>
               <div class="indent4">My girl was sent for—just for company.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="indent4">A tender governess my daughter found,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Her temper placid, her instruction sound; </div>
               <div class="indent4">Plain were her precepts, full of strength, their power<span class="lineNumber">95</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Was founded on the practice of the hour:</div>
               <div class="indent4">Theirs were the happy nights to peace resign’d,</div>
               <div class="indent4">With ample means to cheer th’ unbended mind.</div>
               <div class="indent4">The Sacred History, or the volumes fraught</div>
               <div class="indent4">With tenderest sympathy, or towering thought,<span class="lineNumber">100</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">The laughter-stirring tale, the moral lay,</div>
               <div class="indent4">All that brings dawning reason into day.</div>
               <div class="indent4">There Jennet learn’d by maps, through every land</div>
               <div class="indent4">To travel, and to name them at command; </div>
               <div class="indent4">Would tell how great their strength, their bounds how far,<span class="lineNumber">105</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">And show where uncle Charles was in the war.</div>
               <div class="indent4">The globe she managed with a timid hand,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Told which was ocean, which was solid land,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And said, whate’er their diff ‘rent climates bore,</div>
               <div class="indent4">All still roll’d round, though that I knew before.<span class="lineNumber">110</span></div>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="indent4">Thus grown familiar, and at perfect ease,</div>
               <div class="indent4">What could be Jennet’s duty but to please?</div>
               <div class="indent4">Yet hitherto she kept, scarce knowing why,</div>
               <div class="indent4">One powerful charm reserved, and still was shy. </div>
               <div class="indent4">When Alfred from his grand-piano drew<span class="lineNumber">115</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Those heavenly sounds that seem’d for ever new,</div>
               <div class="indent4">She sat as if to sing would be a crime,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And only gazed with joy, and nodded time.</div>
               <div class="indent4">Till one snug evening, I myself was there,</div>
               <div class="indent4">The whispering lad inquired, behind my chair,<span class="lineNumber">120</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">‘Bowman, can Jennet sing?’ ‘At home,’ said I,</div>
               <div class="indent4">‘She sings from morn till night, and seems to fly</div>
               <div class="indent4">From tune to tune, the sad, the wild, the merry,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And moulds her lip to suit them like a cherry; </div>
               <div class="indent4">She learn’d them here.’—‘O ho!’ said he, ‘O ho!’<span class="lineNumber">125</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">And rubb’d his hands, and stroked his forehead, so.</div>
               <div class="indent4">Then down he sat, sought out a tender strain,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Sung the first words, then struck the chords again;</div>
               <div class="indent4">‘Come, Jennet, help me, you <span class="ital">must </span>know this song</div>
               <div class="indent4">Which I have sung, and you have heard so long.’<span class="lineNumber">130</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">I mark’d the palpitation of her heart,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Yet she complied, and strove to take a part,</div>
               <div class="indent4">But faint and fluttering, swelling by degrees,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Ere self-composure gave that perfect ease, </div>
               <div class="indent4">The soul of song:—then, with triumphant glee,<span class="lineNumber">135</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Resting her idle work upon her knee,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Her little tongue soon fill’d the room around</div>
               <div class="indent4">With such a voluble and magic sound,</div>
               <div class="indent4">That, ’spite of all her pains to persevere, </div>
               <div class="indent4">She stopp’d to sigh, and wipe a starting tear;<span class="lineNumber">140</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Then roused herself for faults to make amends,</div>
               <div class="indent4">While Alfred trembled to his fingers’ ends.</div>
               <div class="indent4">But when this storm of feeling sunk to rest,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Jennet, resuming, sung her very best, </div>
               <div class="indent4">And on the ear, with many a dying fall,<span class="lineNumber">145</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">She pour’d th’ enchanting ‘Harp of Tara’s Hall.’

               <div class="indent4">There’s not another girl in all the land,</div>
               <div class="indent4">If she could bring me empires, bring me sight,</div>

               <div class="indent4">She had a father’s blessing every night,</div>

               <div class="indent4">Once on a sunbright morning, ’twas in June,</div>
               <div class="indent4">I felt my spirits and my hopes in tune,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And idly rambled forth, as if t’ explore</div>
               <div class="indent4">The little valley just before my door; </div>
               <div class="indent4">Down by yon dark green oak I found a seat<span class="lineNumber">185</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Beneath the clustering thorns, a snug retreat</div>
               <div class="indent4">For poets, as I deem’d, who often prize</div>
               <div class="indent4">Such holes and corners far from human eyes;</div>
               <div class="indent4">I mark’d young Alfred, led by Jennet, stray</div>
               <div class="indent4">Just to the spot, both chatting on their way:<span class="lineNumber">190</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">They came behind me, I was still unseen;</div>
               <div class="indent4">He was the elder, Jennet was sixteen.</div>
               <div class="indent4">My heart misgave me, lest I should be deem’d</div>
               <div class="indent4">A prying listener, never much esteem’d, </div>
               <div class="indent4">But this fear soon subsided, and I said,<span class="lineNumber">195</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">‘I’ll hear this blind lad and my little maid.’</div>
               <div class="indent4">That instant down she pluck’d a woodbine wreath,</div>
               <div class="indent4">The loose leaves rattled on my head beneath;</div>
               <div class="indent4">This was for Alfred, which he seized with joy,</div>
               <div class="indent4">‘O, thank you, Jennet,’ said the generous boy.<span class="lineNumber">200</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Much was their talk, which many a theme supplied,</div>
               <div class="indent4">As down they sat, for every blade was dried.</div>
               <div class="indent4">I would have skulk’d away, but dare not move,</div>
               <div class="indent4">‘Besides,’ thought I, ‘they will not talk of love;’</div>
               <div class="indent4">But I was wrong, for Alfred, with a sigh,<span class="lineNumber">205</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">A little tremulous, a little shy,</div>
               <div class="indent4">But, with the tenderest accents, ask’d his guide</div>
               <div class="indent4">A question which might touch both love and pride.</div>
               <div class="indent4">‘This morning, Jennet, why did you delay,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And talk to that strange clown upon your way,<span class="lineNumber">210</span></div>

               <div class="indent4">And ugly too, I’m certain, by his voice,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Besides, he call’d you pretty.’—‘Well, what then?</div>
               <div class="indent4">I cannot hide my face from all the men;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Alfred, indeed, indeed, you are deceived,</div>
               <div class="indent4">He never spoke a word that I believed;<span class="lineNumber">220</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Nay, can he think that I would leave a home</div>
               <div class="indent4">Full of enjoyment, present, and to come,</div>
               <div class="indent4">While your dear mother’s favours daily prove</div>
               <div class="indent4">How sweet the bonds of gratitude and love?</div>
               <div class="indent4">No, while beneath her roof I shall remain,<span class="lineNumber">225</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">I’ll never vex you, never give you pain.’</div>
               <div class="indent4">‘Enough, my life,’ he cried, and up they sprung;</div>
               <div class="indent4">By Heaven, I almost wish’d that I was young;</div>
               <div class="indent4">It was a dainty sight to see them pass,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Light as the July fawns upon the grass,<span class="lineNumber">230</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Pure as the breath of spring when forth it spreads,</div>

               <div class="indent4">Next day I felt what I was bound to do,</div>
               <div class="indent4">To weigh the adventure well, and tell it too;</div>
               <div class="indent4">For Alfred’s mother must not be beguiled,<span class="lineNumber">235</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">He was her earthly hope, her only child;</div>
               <div class="indent4">I had no wish, no right to pass it by,</div>
               <div class="indent4">It might bring grief, perhaps calamity.</div>
               <div class="indent4">She was the judge, and she alone should know</div>
               <div class="indent4">Whether to check the flame or let it grow.<span class="lineNumber">240</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">I went with fluttering heart, and moisten’d eye,</div>
               <div class="indent4">But strong in truth, and arm’d for her reply.</div>
               <div class="indent4">‘Well, master Bowman, why that serious face?’</div>
               <div class="indent4">Exclaim’d the lovely dame, with such a grace, </div>

               <div class="indent4">Not quite the simplest votary ever seen.</div>
               <div class="indent4">I told my tale, and urged that well-known truth,</div>
               <div class="indent4">That the soft passion in the bloom of youth</div>
               <div class="indent4">Starts into power, and leads th’ unconscious heart</div>
               <div class="indent4">A chase where reason takes but little part;<span class="lineNumber">250</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Nothing was more in nature, or more pure,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And from their habits nothing was more sure.</div>
               <div class="indent4">Whether the lady blush’d from pride or joy,</div>
               <div class="indent4">I could but guess;—at length she said—‘My boy </div>
               <div class="indent4">Dropp’d not a syllable of this to me!<span class="lineNumber">255</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">What was I doing, that I could not see?</div>
               <div class="indent4">Through all the anxious hours that I have known,</div>
               <div class="indent4">His welfare still was dearer than my own;</div>
               <div class="indent4">How have I mourn’d o’er his unhappy fate! </div>
               <div class="indent4">Blind as he is! the heir to my estate!<span class="lineNumber">260</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">I now might break his heart, and Jennet’s too;</div>
               <div class="indent4">What must I, Bowman, or what can I do?’—</div>
               <div class="indent4">‘Do, madam?’ said I, boldly, ‘if you trace</div>
               <div class="indent4">Impending degradation or disgrace </div>
               <div class="indent4">In this attachment, let us not delay;<span class="lineNumber">265</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Send my girl home, and check it while you may.’</div>
               <div class="indent4">‘I will,’ she said, but the next moment sigh’d;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Parental love was struggling hard with pride.</div>

            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="indent4">I left her thus, deep musing, and soon found</div>
               <div class="indent4">My daughter, for I traced her by the sound<span class="lineNumber">270</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Of Alfred’s flageolet; no cares had they,</div>
               <div class="indent4">But in the garden bower spent half the day.</div>
               <div class="indent4">By starts he sung, then wildest trillings made,</div>
               <div class="indent4">To mock a piping blackbird in the glade.</div>
               <div class="indent4">I turn’d a corner and approach’d the pair;<span class="lineNumber">275</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">My little rogue had roses in her hair!</div>
               <div class="indent4">She whipp’d them out, and with a downcast look,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Conquer’d a laugh by poring on her book.</div>
               <div class="indent4">My object was to talk with her aside,</div>
               <div class="indent4">But at the sight my resolution died;<span class="lineNumber">280</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">They look’d so happy in their blameless glee,</div>
               <div class="indent4">That, as I found them, I e’en let them be;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Though Jennet promised a few social hours</div>
               <div class="indent4">’Midst her old friends, my poultry, and my flowers.</div>
               <div class="indent4">She came,—but not till fatal news had wrung<span class="lineNumber">285</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Her heart through sleepless hours, and chain’d her tongue.</div>
               <div class="indent4">She came, but with a look that gave me pain,</div>
               <div class="indent4">For, though bright sunbeams sparkled after rain,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Though every brood came round, half run, half fly,</div>
               <div class="indent4">I knew her anguish by her alter’d eye;<span class="lineNumber">290</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">And strove, with all my power, where’er she came,</div>
               <div class="indent4">To soothe her grief, yet gave it not a name.</div>
               <div class="indent4">At length a few sad bitter tears she shed,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And on both hands reclined her aching head.</div>
               <div class="indent4">’Twas then my time the conqueror to prove,<span class="lineNumber">295</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">I summon’d all my rhetoric, all my love.</div>
               <div class="indent4">‘Jennet, you must not think to pass through life</div>
               <div class="indent4">Without its sorrows, and without its strife;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Good, dutiful, and worthy, as you are,</div>
               <div class="indent4">You must have griefs, and you must learn to bear.’<span class="lineNumber">300</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Thus I went on, trite moral truths to string,—</div>
               <div class="indent4">All chaff, mere chaff, where love has spread his wing:</div>
               <div class="indent4">She cared not, listen’d not, nor seem’d to know</div>
               <div class="indent4">What was my aim, but wiped her burning brow, </div>
               <div class="indent4">Where sat more eloquence and living power<span class="lineNumber">305</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Than language could embody in an hour.</div>
               <div class="indent4">With soften’d tone I mention’d Alfred’s name,</div>
               <div class="indent4">His wealth, our poverty, and that sad blame</div>
               <div class="indent4">Which would have weigh’d me down, had I not told</div>
               <div class="indent4">The secret which I dare not keep for gold,<span class="lineNumber">310</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Of Alfred’s love, o’erheard the other morn,</div>
               <div class="indent4">The gardener, and the woodbine, and the thorn;</div>
               <div class="indent4">And added, ‘Though the lady sends you home,</div>
               <div class="indent4">You are but young, child, and a day may come’—</div>
               <div class="indent4">‘She has <span class="ital">not </span>sent me home,’ the girl replied,<span class="lineNumber">315</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">And rose with sobs of passion from my side;</div>
               <div class="indent4">‘She has <span class="ital">not </span>sent me home, dear father, no;</div>
               <div class="indent4">She gives me leave to tarry or to go;</div>
               <div class="indent4">She has not <span class="ital">blamed </span>me,—yet she weeps no less,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And every tear but adds to my distress;<span class="lineNumber">320</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">I am the cause,—thus all that she has done</div>
               <div class="indent4">Will bring the death or misery of her son.</div>
               <div class="indent4">Jealous he might be, could he but have seen</div>
               <div class="indent4">How other lads approach’d where I have been;</div>
               <div class="indent4">But this man’s voice offends his very soul,<span class="lineNumber">325</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">That strange antipathy brooks no control;</div>
               <div class="indent4">And should I leave him now, or seem unkind,</div>
               <div class="indent4">The thought would surely wreck his noble mind;</div>
               <div class="indent4">To leave him thus, and in his utmost need! </div>
               <div class="indent4">Poor Alfred! then you will be blind indeed!<span class="lineNumber">330</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">I will not leave him.’—‘Nay, child, do not rave,</div>
               <div class="indent4">What, would you be his menial, be his slave?’</div>
               <div class="indent4">‘Yes,’ she exclaim’d, and wiped each streaming eye,</div>
               <div class="indent4">‘Yes, be his slave, and serve him till I die;</div>
               <div class="indent4">He is too just to act the tyrant’s part,<span class="lineNumber">335</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">He’s truth itself.’ O how my burthen’d heart</div>
               <div class="indent4">Sigh’d for relief!—soon that relief was found;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Without one word we traced the meadow round,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Her feverish hand in mine, and weigh’d the case,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Nor dared to look each other in the face;<span class="lineNumber">340</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Till, with a sudden stop, as if from fear,</div>
               <div class="indent4">I roused her sinking spirit, ‘Who comes here?’</div>
               <div class="indent4">Down the green slope before us, glowing warm,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Came Alfred, tugging at his mother’s arm;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Willing she seem’d, but he still led the way,<span class="lineNumber">345</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">She had not walk’d so fast for many a day;</div>
               <div class="indent4">His hand was lifted, and his brow was bare,</div>
               <div class="indent4">For now no clust’ring ringlets wanton’d there,</div>
               <div class="indent4">He threw them back in anger and in spleen,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And shouted ‘Jennet’ o’er the daisied green.<span class="lineNumber">350</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Boyish impatience strove with manly grace</div>

               <div class="indent4">My heart exulted while my breath was staid.</div>

               <div class="indent4">Jennet is mine, and <span class="ital">shall </span>be—say no more;<span class="lineNumber">360</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Bowman, you know not what a friend I’ll be;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Give me your daughter, Bowman, give her me;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Jennet, what will my days be if you go?</div>
               <div class="indent4">A dreary darkness, and a life of woe: </div>

               <div class="indent4">To such appeals all prompt replies are cold,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And stately prudence snaps her cobweb hold.</div>
               <div class="indent4">Had the good widow tried, or wish’d to speak,</div>
               <div class="indent4">This was a bond she could not, dared not break;<span class="lineNumber">370</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Their hearts (you never saw their likeness, never)</div>
               <div class="indent4">Were join’d, indissolubly join’d for ever.</div>
               <div class="indent4">Why need I tell how soon our tears were dried,</div>
               <div class="indent4">How Jennet blush’d, how Alfred with a stride </div>
               <div class="indent4">Bore off his prize, and fancied every charm,<span class="lineNumber">375</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">And clipp’d against his ribs her trembling arm;</div>
               <div class="indent4">How mute we seniors stood, our power all gone?</div>
               <div class="indent4">Completely conquer’d, Love the day had won,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And the young vagrant triumph’d in our plight,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And shook his roguish plumes, and laugh’d outright.<span class="lineNumber">380</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Yet, by my life and hopes, I would not part</div>
               <div class="indent4">With this sweet recollection from my heart;</div>
               <div class="indent4">I would not now forget that tender scene</div>
               <div class="indent4">To wear a crown, or make my girl a queen.</div>
               <div class="indent4">Why need be told how pass’d the months along,<span class="lineNumber">385</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">How sped the summer’s walk, the winter’s song,</div>
               <div class="indent4">How the foil’d suitor all his hopes gave up,</div>
               <div class="indent4">How Providence with rapture fill’d their cup?</div>
               <div class="indent4">No dark regrets, no tragic scenes to prove,</div>
               <div class="indent4">The gardener was too old to die for love.<span class="lineNumber">390</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">A thousand incidents I cast aside</div>
               <div class="indent4">To tell but one—I gave away the bride—</div>
               <div class="indent4">Gave the dear youth what kings could not have given;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Then bless’d them both, and put my trust in Heaven.</div>
               <div class="indent4">There the old neighbours laugh’d the night away,<span class="lineNumber">395</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Who talk of Jennet’s wedding to this day.</div>
               <div class="indent4">And could you but have seen the modest grace,</div>
               <div class="indent4">The half-hid smiles that play’d in Jennet’s face,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Or mark’d the bridegroom’s bounding heart o’erflow,</div>
               <div class="indent4">You might have wept for joy, as I could now:<span class="lineNumber">400</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">I speak from memory of days long past;</div>

               <div class="indent4">Where thou with me from peep of dawn hast been: </div>
               <div class="indent4">We did not promise that this motley throng</div>
               <div class="indent4">Should every <span class="ital">one </span>supply a votive song,</div>

               <div class="indent4">Which might o’er listening patience still prevail, </div>
               <div class="indent4">Did fancy waver not, nor daylight fail.</div>
               <div class="indent4">‘The Soldier’s Wife,’ her toils, his battles o’er,</div>

               <div class="indent4">Then, ‘Lines to Aggravation’ form the close,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Parent of murders, and the worst of woes.</div>
               <div class="indent4">But while the changeful hours of daylight flew,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Some homeward look’d, and talk’d of evening dew;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Some watch’d the sun’s decline, and stroll’d around,<span class="lineNumber">15</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Some wish’d another dance, and partners found;</div>
               <div class="indent4">When in an instant every eye was drawn </div>
               <div class="indent4">To one bright object on the upper lawn;</div>
               <div class="indent4">A fair procession from the mansion came,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Unknown its purport, and unknown its aim.<span class="lineNumber">20</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">No gazer could refrain, no tongue could cease,</div>
               <div class="indent4">It seem’d an embassy of love and peace. </div>
               <div class="indent4">Nearer and nearer still approach’d the train,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Age in the van transform’d to youth again.</div>
               <div class="indent4">Sir Ambrose gazed, and scarce believed his eyes;<span class="lineNumber">25</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">’Twas magic, memory, love, and blank surprise,</div>
               <div class="indent4">For there his venerable lady wore </div>
               <div class="indent4">The very dress which, sixty years before,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Had sparkled on her sunshine bridal morn,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Had sparkled, ay, beneath this very thorn!<span class="lineNumber">30</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Her hair was snowy white, o’er which was seen,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Emblem of what her bridal cheeks had been, </div>
               <div class="indent4">A twin red rose—no other ornament</div>
               <div class="indent4">Had pride suggested, or false feeling lent;</div>
               <div class="indent4">She came to grace the triumph of her lord,<span class="lineNumber">35</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">And pay him honours at his festive board.</div>
               <div class="indent4">Nine ruddy lasses follow’d where she stepp’d; </div>
               <div class="indent4">White were their virgin robes, that lightly swept</div>
               <div class="indent4">The downy grass; in every laughing eye</div>
               <div class="indent4">Cupid had skulk’d, and written ‘victory.’<span class="lineNumber">40</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">What heart on earth its homage could refuse?</div>
               <div class="indent4">Each tripp’d, unconsciously, a blushing Muse.</div>
               <div class="indent4">A slender chaplet of fresh blossoms bound</div>
               <div class="indent4">Their clustering ringlets in a magic round.</div>
               <div class="indent4">And, as they slowly moved across the green,<span class="lineNumber">45</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Each in her beauty seem’d a May-day queen.</div>
               <div class="indent4">The first a wreath bore in her outstretch’d hand, </div>
               <div class="indent4">The rest a single rose upon a wand;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Their steps were measured to that grassy throne</div>
               <div class="indent4">Where, watching them, Sir Ambrose sat alone.<span class="lineNumber">50</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">They stopp’d,—when she, the foremost of the row,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Curtsied, and placed the wreath upon his brow; </div>
               <div class="indent4">The rest, in order pacing by his bower,</div>
               <div class="indent4">In the loop’d wreath left each her single flower,—</div>
               <div class="indent4">Then stood aside.—What broke the scene’s repose?<span class="lineNumber">55</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">The whole assembly clapp’d their hands and rose.</div>
               <div class="indent4">The Muses charm’d them as they form’d a ring, </div>
               <div class="indent4">And look’d the very life and soul of Spring!</div>
               <div class="indent4">But still the white hair’d dame they view’d with pride,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Her love so perfect, and her truth so tried.<span class="lineNumber">60</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Oh, sweet it is to hear, to see, to name,</div>
               <div class="indent4">Unquench’d affection in the palsied frame— </div>
               <div class="indent4">To think upon the boundless raptures past,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And love, triumphant, conquering to the last!</div>

               <div class="indent4">Yet utterance found not, though in virtue’s cause, </div>
               <div class="indent4">But acclamations fill’d up nature’s pause,</div>

               <div class="indent4">The language of delight its bondage broke,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And many a warm heart bless’d him as he spoke. </div>

               <div class="indent4">The words of truth, like leading stars, survive;</div>

               <div class="indent4">Farewell!’ he said, then took his lady’s arm,</div>
               <div class="indent4">On his shrunk hand her starting tears fell warm; </div>
               <div class="indent4">Again he turn’d to view the happy crowd,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And cried, ‘Good night, good night, good night,’ aloud,</div>
               <div class="indent4">‘Health to you all! for see, the evening closes,’<span class="lineNumber">95</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Then march’d to rest, beneath his crown of roses.</div>
               <div class="indent4">‘Happy old man! with feelings such as these, </div>
               <div class="indent4">The seasons all can charm, and trifles please.’</div>
               <div class="indent4">An instantaneous shout re-echoed round,</div>
               <div class="indent4">’Twas wine and gratitude inspired the sound:<span class="lineNumber">100</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Some joyous souls resumed the dance again,</div>
               <div class="indent4">The aged loiter’d o’er the homeward plain,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And scatter’d lovers rambled through the park,</div>
               <div class="indent4">And breathed their vows of honour in the dark;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Others a festal harmony preferr’d,<span class="lineNumber">105</span></div>
               <div class="indent4">Still round the thorn the jovial song was heard;</div>
               <div class="indent4">Dance, rhymes, and fame, they scorn’d such things as these, </div>
               <div class="indent4">But drain’d the mouldy barrel to its lees,</div>
               <div class="indent4">As if ’twere worse than shame to want repose:</div>

               <div class="indent4">And on each turret pour’d a brilliant gleam</div>
               <div class="indent4">Of modest light, that trembled on the stream; </div>
               <div class="indent4">The owl awoke, but dared not yet complain,</div>
