                  <p>In 1813, an anonymous government spy reported to the Home Office a suspicious development
                     in the London publishing world. Given the paranoid political culture of the time,
                     the existence of such a report is not unusual in itself. Its importance lies in the
                     subject of its scrutiny. The publisher in question was producing neither revolutionary
                     pamphlets nor rabble-rousing Jacobin novels but such titles as <em>Tom and His Cat: the Surprising History of a Good Boy</em> (1806) and <em>Think Before You Speak, or, The Three Wishes</em> (1809); yet, these titles made his identity all the more alarming, for he was a known
                     political radical: <span class="quote">‘At length Mr. J. Godwin [sic] was written on the door-post in very small letters;
                        within a few months it appeared boldly in large letters over the door; still it is
                        very little known that the proprietor is <em>Godwin</em>, the author of <em>Political Justice</em>. There appears to be a regular system through all his publications to supercede all
                        other elementary books, and to make his library the resort of preparatory schools,
                        that in time the principles of democracy and Theo-philanthropy may take place universally.

                     literature have long demonstrated: that children's literature at the turn of the nineteenth
                     century was a site of political and ideological conflict.

                     </div> The spy worries about the impact of Godwin's books on young minds. As the report observes,
                     Godwin has pseudonymously authored not one but several books for children including
                     a mythology textbook that "artfully hints the wisdom of the morality of the heathen
                     world" (162) and an insidious pocket dictionary, "which consists in giving only <em>one</em> meaning to words which have several, and omitting all such words as philosophers of
                     the present day do not like to explain" (163, emphasis in original).</p>
               </div>
               <p>The spy is concerned not only with the publisher's rhetoric but also his marketing
                  and distribution practices. This dangerous publisher, the report warns, discounts
                  his books "in order to allure schools of a moderate or lower class" (162). Worse still,
                  he has written a comprehensive curriculum to indoctrinate children to his political
                  beliefs in each facet of their early education. By offering "every work […] that can
                  be required in the early instruction of children" (164), the Juvenile Library is a
                  platform to trumpet "every principle professed by the infidels and republicans of
                  these days" (164). The consequence, the report predicts, is the democratization of
                  an entire generation, leading to the same type of social unrest that sparked the French
                  Revolution: "By such means did Voltaire and his brethren for twenty years before the
                  Revolution in France spread infidelity and disloyalty through the remotest provinces
                  of that country, and we know too well how they succeeded" (164). By extension, the
                  Juvenile Library threatens nothing less than the government's worst fears about a
                  political uprising.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>This report can be read as a reflection of the intense political anxiety that colored
                     the turn of the nineteenth century in England: it projects vast and terrible consequences
                     contingent on the literary output of what was, in fact, a small publishing house that
                     went out of business in the economic downturn of the 1820s. This report is certainly
                     hyperbolic, but it is also perspicacious. As Pamela Clemit argues, a "regular system" <em>is</em> discernable throughout Godwin's books, a system as much political and literary as
                     it is educational (
                     “Philosophical Anarchism”
                      47). It is an interest in further investigating this "system" that initially inspired
                     this project, which has been motivated by two central questions. First, why would
                     Godwin—anarchist philosopher, political advocate, and successful novelist and dramatist—decide
                     in the middle of his career to pseudonymously author, publish, and sell children's
                     books? Second, what is the relationship between Godwin's children's books and his
                     other writings? At first glance, Godwin's decision to publish books for children appears
                     at once unlikely and unwise: the Juvenile Library's success depended on Godwin's anonymity
                     because of his reputation for radical politics and loose morals. Godwin lived in dangerous
                     times: if his customers had known his identity, he could have lost their patronage;
                     if the government had discerned it (and deemed it threatening enough), he could have
                     been tried or even imprisoned, as had other radical writers and publishers before
                     him.

                     </div> At the same time, Godwin's involvement in the production of books for children makes

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Long before he opened the Juvenile Library, Godwin had contemplated the role of reading
                     in education and, ultimately, social politics. Thoughts about education permeate his
                     works from the 1790s, from <em>An Enquiry into Political Justice and Its Influence on Morals and Happiness</em> (1793) to <em>The Enquirer: Reflections on Education, Manners, and Literature</em> (1797) and <em>St. Leon</em> (1799). Three years before he opened the Juvenile Library, Godwin had written a children's
                     book for Benjamin Tabart under the pseudonym William Scolfield. Although criticized
                     by Sarah Trimmer, <em>Bible Stories. Memorable Acts of the Ancient Patriarchs, Judges, and Kings: Extracted
                        from their Original Historians</em> (1802) was successful: according to William St Clair it underwent multiple reprints
                     and was pirated in the United States.

                     </div> <em>Bible Stories</em>' success, St Clair conjectures, likely encouraged Godwin to continue writing for
                     children (<em>Godwins</em> 284). Godwin's decision to write for children appears to have been motivated by personal
                     experience as well as professional success and interest. By the time Godwin and his
                     second wife, Mary Jane, embarked on the Juvenile Library venture, they were raising
                     five young children: Mary Godwin, the daughter of Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft who
                     would eventually marry Percy Shelley and author <em>Frankenstein; or the Modern Prometheus</em> (1818), among many other titles; William Godwin, Godwin's son with Mary Jane; Fanny
                     Imlay, Wollstonecraft's daughter with Gilbert Imlay; and Charles and Mary Jane (later
                     Claire) Clairmont, Mary Jane's children from previous relationships. As a parent and
                     social reformer, Godwin was keenly aware of the pedagogical needs of young readers
                     and of the insufficiency of the books available to them. As he explains in the preface
                     to <em>Bible Stories</em>, his motivations are those of a parent: "The following book is the production of
                     a parent, who could not find, among the numerous works which for the last twenty years
                     have been published for the use of children, one which he could with complete satisfaction
                     put into the hands of his own."

                     Godwin to produce books for children that would further the political theories and

                     the radical Godwin with atheism, subversion, and sexual immorality often praised the
                     children's books he wrote under his pen names: "Edward Baldwin," "William Scolfield,"

                     although the reviewer had misgivings about the work's rendition of the Reformation.

                              and/or his oeuvre were published between 1992 and 2012. For the purposes of clarity
                              and efficiency, we have decided to remove dissertations and scholarly literature written
                              in foreign languages. This decision left us with 179 works, which we categorized based
                              on the

                     </div> It is difficult to determine why such a disproportion exists. One possible reason
                     is the relative inaccessibility of Godwin's children's works. In spite of their long
                     publication histories in the nineteenth century, these books are no longer in print
                     today. The only exception is the 2010 facsimile edition of <em>The Pantheon</em> by Kissinger Publishing, which fails to identify Edward Baldwin as Godwin's pseudonym.
                     The Pickering &amp; Chatto edition of <em>The Political and Philosophical Writings of William Godwin</em> (1993) reprints the preface to <em>Bible Stories</em> alone among Godwin's Juvenile Library works.

                              Clemit cites a 2 January 1828 note (held in the Abinger deposit) in which Godwin requests
                              that his literary executor include Baldwin's Fables, Pantheon, the histories of England,
                              Rome, and Greece, and the preface to Bible Stories in future editions of his miscellaneous
                              works (98).</span></div>
                     </div> Available primarily in special collections, microfilm departments, or through rare
                     book dealers, these books have limited circulation.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Another reason may be one of attribution. While Godwin's pseudonyms successfully hid
                  his identity from the majority of his buyers, they also slowed and, at times, prevented
                  librarians from properly cataloging his works. For instance, St Clair argues that
                  his book, <em>The Godwins and the Shelleys: the Biography of a Family</em> (1989), is the first work to properly attribute <em>Bible Stories</em> to Godwin (279). Although 23 years have passed since this attribution, the larger
                  point is that Godwin's authorial identity remained largely unknown for 187 years;
                  Godwin's children's books have not been part of the scholarly landscape for as long
                  as his more recognizable works. In this, Godwin poses a challenge similar to that
                  of his friend Mary Robinson, who published poetry under a host of pseudonyms that
                  continue to challenge scholars trying to reconstruct her career.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>A third reason may simply be that Godwin does not comfortably fit within the dominant
                     historical narrative of late-eighteenth-century children's literature as it has developed
                     in the 1990s and 2000s. Once seen as a veritable wasteland of didactic fiction against
                     which Romantic poets rebelled with new imaginative literature, scholars now recognize
                     the 1790s and 1800s as a dynamic era of experimentation in children's writing and
                     education.

                     </div> Such work has led to no less than the recuperation of children's didactic fiction
                     and an expanded understanding of children's literature in this period. Nonetheless,
                     Donelle Ruwe observes that scholars of British Romanticism continue to think of children's
                     literature from this era in dichotomizing ways: as a struggle between books that appealed
                     to children's imaginations (both through didactic literature and fairy tales), or
                     books that sought simply to instruct them (2). This binary, Ruwe argues, has led scholars
                     to overlook those authors who wrote textbooks, in particular Sarah Trimmer and William
                     Godwin (2). Of these two authors, Godwin is especially complex because his vision
                     of childhood—and, by extension, children's education—was an amalgam of Romantic poetic
                     ideology, his own political philosophies, and his practical experience raising children;
                     it was highly nuanced and always in the process of development. In <em>The Enquirer</em> (1797), for example, Godwin endorses imaginative freedom as a cornerstone of education
                     when he encourages young readers to "wander in the wilds of literature."

                     books and the Juvenile Library. This deficiency is all the more striking when we consider
                     that Godwin's children's books (both the ones he wrote and the ones he published)
                     were popular in their own time and remained so even after his business crumbled. Some
                     of the books he published, such as Charles and Mary Lamb's <em>Tales from Shakespear</em> (1807) and the first English translation of what would later be known as <em>The Swiss Family Robinson</em>, remained in circulation into the twentieth century.

                     political and social history. So too should their influence. Godwin's ability to appeal
                     to schoolteachers, parents, and students enabled him significantly to effect children's
                     book production and the politics of childhood in the early nineteenth century, but
                     it also allowed him to disseminate his beliefs on a broad scale. As St Clair argues,
                     many of Godwin's children's books gained a wider contemporary circulation and had
                     a longer-lasting impact than the philosophical and fictional works for which he is
                     now most celebrated.

                  various genres in which he wrote, in particular between his children's books, his
                  novels, and his political writings? These are only a few questions we believe his
                  children's books raise, and we hope this edition will pave the way for new scholarship
                  on Godwin, the history of children's literature, and the history of British social

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The spy report on the Juvenile Library illustrates the difficulties Godwin faced,
                     in large part, because of the reputation he had acquired in the 1790s as a political
                     radical. Few public figures during that tumultuous decade were as famous or as controversial
                     in England as William Godwin. In the fearful political climate that followed the French
                     Revolution and England's subsequent declaration of war with France, the English government
                     kept one wary eye fixed on the Channel and the other on London radicals, political
                     dissenters, and other dealers in unpatriotic licentiousness and "French" immorality.
                     Godwin was an offender on all of these fronts. His visibility in the London political
                     scene made him a hero both to mainstream Whigs and to the radical Jacobin fringe.
                     Throughout his life, he corresponded and kept company with almost every important
                     writer and political radical of his time, but it was his literary output in the 1790s
                     that sealed Godwin's reputation as a Jacobin.

                     </div> The publication of <em>Political Justice</em> (1793), in which Godwin examines the philosophical principles behind the French Revolution
                     and criticizes the role of political institutions, branded Godwin as a radical in
                     the public opinion. <em>Things as They Are; or The Adventures of Caleb Williams</em> (1794) confirmed this reputation. A proto-thriller that champions individual liberty
                     and opposition to tyranny, this novel dramatizes many of the ideas of <em>Political Justice</em>, and to devastating effect. <em>Caleb Williams</em> appeared in the same year as <em>Cursory Strictures on the Charge Delivered by Lord Chief Justice Eyre to the Grand
                        Jury, October 2, 1794</em> (1794), Godwin's defense of the radicals Thomas Hardy, John Horne Tooke, and John
                     Thelwall during the Treason Trials of 1794. Taken as a whole, these three publications,
                     each electrifying and each directed to a different audience, associated Godwin in
                     the public eye with the dangerous Jacobin fringe. Godwin's candid biography of his
                     late wife Mary Wollstonecraft, <em>Memoirs of the Author of a Vindication of the Rights of Women</em> (1798), forever linked him with sexual indecency and loose morality. <em>Memoirs</em>' frank depictions of Wollstonecraft's love affairs, suicide attempts, and illegitimate
                     child not only tainted Wollstonecraft's already questionable posthumous reputation
                     but also further maligned that of her widower.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Godwin was also aligned with the radical left by a government that felt itself on
                  the brink of a revolution and reacted decisively, even draconically, to the threat
                  posed by Godwin and his contemporaries. Parliament suspended <span class="foreign">habeas corpus</span> in 1794, and after the failure of the treason trials of Hardy, Tooke, Thelwall, and
                  other members of the London Corresponding Society (who were acquitted, in part, because
                  of Godwin's efforts) as well as several sobering attacks on the King by rowdy mobs
                  shouting for reform and bread in 1795, Parliament instituted the two so-called Gagging
                  Acts: The Treasonable Practices Act and the Seditious Meetings Act. Both acts aimed
                  to stifle free speech and assembly and cripple the radical movement. After 1795, it
                  was nearly impossible to gather a group of more than fifty citizens without the threat
                  of arrest for treason.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Increased literacy and exploding literary output of this decade also played a decisive
                     role in heightening political anxieties. While social unrest stemmed from a variety
                     of sources—from rising prices in commodities to land enclosure to the inequalities
                     of factory labor—the availability of printing presses and cheap paper made possible
                     the large-scale distribution of literature, both moralizing and inflammatory. Rising
                     print production correlates with an upsurge in literacy, especially among the lower
                     classes. Charity schools and Sunday schools grew in this period with the primary aim
                     of helping poor children and adults learn to read the bible. Rising literacy rates
                     had an unintended outcome, a voracious public appetite for reading material, in particular
                     political pamphlets. This genre was immensely popular with readers and publishers
                     alike: pamphlets were easy to print and cheaper than books, which meant they could
                     be produced on large scales that made them more accessible to the average citizen.

                     </div> Pamphlets could disseminate information and raise passions much like the large-scale
                     gatherings outlawed by the government. For example, Thomas Paine's <em>Rights of Man</em> (1791), an incendiary defense of mankind's natural rights in the face of governmental
                     tyranny, was consumed in unprecedented numbers by the newly-literate lower classes.
                     The government responded by trying and convicting Paine of sedition, but his ideas
                     nonetheless were influential. Godwin was not involved in the production of <em>Rights of Man</em>, but Paine helps illustrate both the dangers Godwin faced from government officials,
                     and the opportunities print production offered him for sharing his ideas with a broad
                     audience. The spy report was perhaps rightfully wary of him: Godwin was not simply
                     a radical, but one with an interest in children's education and the means to widely
                     produce and distribute his writings in London and across the country.</p>

                     rise in adults' and children's literacy along with the means of reproducing literature
                     accessible to the masses—significantly altered the state of literature for children.
                     The very concept of childhood was transformed in these decades, as the idea of childhood
                     as a time of innocence and free play blossomed in the Romantic era from its Enlightenment
                     beginnings. Children's literature experienced two watersheds in the eighteenth century,
                     with the 1740s marking the beginnings of children's imaginative literature and the
                     1780s witnessing a shift to more didactic types of fiction.

                              with the dour, didactic fiction of the 1780s and 1790s drowning out the more playful,
                              imaginative fiction from earlier in the century. However, in 
                              “Wordsworth, Fairy Tales, and the Politics of Children's Reading,”
                              Richardson argues that scholars need to be more aware of the way in which this post-romantic
                              scholarly narrative influences our reading of children's literary history, in particular
                              the way in which we see late-century didactic children's fiction.</span></div>
                     </div> Scholars traditionally have celebrated John Newbery's <em>A Little Pretty Pocket Book</em> (1744) as the first book of modern children's literature (that is, the first book
                     designed for children's amusement), even though they concede that books for children
                     existed since at least the late seventeenth century, many of which, as F.J. Harvey
                     Darnton argues, were designed to give children "the highest pleasure, that of studying
                     and enjoying the Will of God" (53). Nevertheless, scholars find something distinct
                     about Newbery's fiction for children: its playfulness. With their decorative bindings,
                     witty titles, and accompanying toys, Newbery's books self-consciously were designed
                     to appeal to children. Newbery published a variety of children's works, from ABCs
                     to science books to miscellanies, but it is his juvenile fiction that came to epitomize
                     what Darnton calls Newbery's "'plumb cake' and morality" literary style characterized
                     by its lighthearted tone and educational purpose (125). <em>The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes; Otherwise Called Mrs. Margery Two-Shoes</em> (1765), arguably one of his most famous publications, presents adventures similar
                     to those found in longer novels, but abridged into a shorter, child-focused story. <em>Goody Two-Shoes</em> provided instructive life lessons, but it did so in ways that readers presumably found
                     enjoyable. It remained in print throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,
                     and Mary Jackson observes that it even experienced a resurgence during World War II.

                     edged out Newbery's books, figuratively and literally. By the beginning of the nineteenth
                     century, Romantic-era writers such as Charles Lamb looked back fondly on the 1740s
                     and 1750s as a golden age of children's books, one that was being eradicated by what
                     he refers to in a letter to Samuel Taylor Coleridge as the "cursed Barbauld crew."
                     Their didactic fiction, he complains, had all but supplanted <em>Goody Two-Shoes</em> and fairy tales: <span class="quote">‘Goody Two Shoes is almost out of print. Mrs. Barbauld['s] stuff has banished all the

                        </div>’</span> In actuality, this "crew" was a diverse and unconnected group of writers which included
                     the Christian moralist Sarah Trimmer, the conservative social reformer Hannah More,
                     the more liberal educators Maria Edgeworth and Anna Barbauld, the popular novelist
                     Charlotte Smith, and the radical Mary Wollstonecraft, among others. Though personally
                     and politically distinct, their work coheres in what Lamb derisively perceives to
                     be an interest in teaching children intellectual and ethical lessons in real-world
                     settings. Lamb's and other Romantic writers' denigration of these authors has influenced
                     their historical reputation as prudes and pedants—a reputation that Myers, Richardson,
                     Clarke, and others have exploded. However unfair and obsolete this reputation, there
                     is a grain of truth to it: these authors did write stories embedded in the realities
                     of domestic life in order to train their young readers to enter a world of social
                     dislocation, inequality, and injustice. While Margery Two-Shoes enjoys a change of
                     fortune from shoeless orphan to wealthy heiress, her successors in Smith, Wollstonecraft,
                     and More experience little of her economic or social mobility. They face worlds populated
                     by begging veterans, ragged orphans, and young women consigned to lives of genteel
                     poverty because unable to earn an independent wage and unable (or unwilling) to marry.
                     In this setting, there are no opportunities for Margery's entrepreneurism; protagonists
                     must learn obedience, kindness, frugality, and fortitude as well as duty to family,
                     community, country, and God. The same types of rewards Margery enjoys are no longer
                     available; readers (and characters) must learn to cope with the world as they find
                     it.</p>

                  <p>These didactic writers' realistic styles are as much expressions of their social politics

                     Edgeworth, Smith, and Barbauld differed politically, but they were united in their
                     distrust of so-called imaginative fiction (such as fairy tales and romances) as wasteful,
                     self-indulgent, and confusing to children. While Myers and Richardson have shown that
                     these authors appropriated fairy tale elements in their work, their stories generally
                     discouraged flights of fancy; instead, they inspired young readers to learn about
                     and take pleasure in the world around them.

                     in the countryside. It is precisely this turn to practical and scientific knowledge
                     that Lamb finds so offensive, a blight on children's literature and, by extension,
                     childhood itself. In this view Godwin agrees with Lamb. In the preface to <em>Bible Stories</em> he laments that, a generation hence, young people "will be able to tell you from what
                     part of the globe you receive every article of your furniture; and will explain the
                     process of manufacturing a carpet," but will have no access to imagination, for Godwin
                     that "most essential branch of human nature" and "the ground-plot upon which the edifice
                     of a sound morality must be erected" (313-314).</p>
               </div>
               <p>With their impassioned defenses of imagination, Lamb and Godwin bespeak a new definition
                  of childhood that came into vogue during the Romantic period. <em>Goody Two-Shoes</em> was written for a child who was still considered a blank slate who must be taught
                  social morality, a concept articulated by John Locke in the late seventeenth century.
                  By the mid eighteenth century, however, Jean Jacques Rousseau's controversial depiction
                  of the education of a natural man, <em>Émile, ou de L'Éducation</em> (1762), insisted that childhood was not simply a time of social inexperience but
                  of innocence, which children should spend in nature and only slowly be introduced
                  into the world after puberty. Despite resistance to Rousseauvian pedagogy by educators
                  such as Mary Wollstonecraft and Maria Edgeworth (who both rejected Rousseau's depictions
                  of female education as reductive and antirational) and Godwin himself, <em>Émile</em> significantly influenced the idea of childhood in the 1790s in Britain. Rousseau's
                  vision of youthful development—especially that of boys—inspired Romantic poets such
                  as William Blake, Samuel Coleridge, and William Wordsworth who, in turn, portrayed
                  childhood as a time of angelic or primeval innocence, which should be unfettered from
                  social responsibilities. This conception led to these poets' celebration of fairy
                  tales and indigenous myths that had been long relegated to servants and peasants,
                  but which they believed represented a simpler society associated with childhood.</p>
               <p>It is, in part, the reintroduction of fairy tales into the nursery that writers such
                  as Barbauld, Smith, and Trimmer opposed, even as they appropriated fairy-tale elements
                  into their own literature; they dismiss fairy tales as antirational, more appropriate
                  to the poetic concept of childhood than the actual practice of raising children. Distrusting
                  fantasy literature, Barbauld, Trimmer, Edgeworth, and others instead sought to amuse
                  children by engaging them in realistic narratives in which good does not always triumph
                  over evil, and virtue is not always rewarded. Fairy tales, romances, and some novels,
                  they feared, beguiled children's understandings; romances and novels impeded their
                  emotional and intellectual developments by habituating them to heightened passions
                  or by raising their sentimental expectations. From the radical Wollstonecraft to the
                  conservative Trimmer, these authors sought to inculcate the young reader with a sense
                  of duty and position and offer moral guidance.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Though similar in the value they place on education and the genres in which they wrote,
                     there were importance differences between these authors, especially surrounding questions
                     of class mobility and religion. Moral guidance offered by Wollstonecraft, Smith, and
                     Edgeworth was more social than spiritual; inset tales in <em>Original Stories from Real Life</em> (1788) and <em>Rural Walks</em> (1795), for example, encourage charitable benevolence and kindness to animals, while
                     stories like Edgeworth's 
                     “Lazy Lawrence”
                      (1800) teach the value of hard work. Trimmer also offers these lessons, especially
                     in her popular <em>Fabulous Histories. Designed for the Instruction of Children Respecting their Treatment
                        of Animals</em> (1786), but she also includes religious lessons in her works, admonishing readers
                     that conformity to mainstream religion was a means to spiritual salvation. Much like
                     Godwin, Trimmer was dissatisfied with the literature available to children, but their
                     similarities confined themselves to this concern. In reality, they were opposed in
                     their politics and philosophy. Trimmer, a High Church educator and mother of twelve,
                     felt that contemporary literature for children was so spiritually (and developmentally)
                     misguided that all but a few carefully chosen works would corrupt young minds. In
                     1802 she started the <em>Guardian of Education</em>, a periodical review of children's literature closely modeled on the <em>Anti-Jacobin Review</em>, the publication that sought to controvert the perceived threat of Jacobin principles
                     in England following the French Revolution. The comparison is not merely formal. Like
                     the <em>Anti-Jacobin</em>, the <em>Guardian</em>'s reviews uncover dangerous and subversive elements, but for literature written to
                     a much younger audience.

                              evolved in the early 1800s into a debate about "education as the means by which social
                              change was to be achieved" (44).</span></div>
                     </div> To Trimmer and her cohort of conservative writers, the problem with fairy tales and
                     fanciful stories is not that they cultivated imagination per se, but that they encouraged
                     children to imagine social milieus other than the ones to which they were born; they
                     encouraged them to imagine the wrong sorts of things. For Trimmer, this type of thinking
                     was synonymous with dangerous liberalism and radical, democratic ideas.

                  <p>Trimmer excoriated Godwin's first children's book, <em>Bible Stories</em> (published under the pseudonym William Scolfield), for treating "the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Histories in the Bible</span>" as "<em>common histories for children</em>"—that is, for ranking the "<em>sacred writers</em> who penned what the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> dictated […] with the <em>authors of profane history</em>."

                              1 (1802), in William Godwin Reviewed: A Reception History 1783-1834, ed. Kenneth Graham

                              edition.</span></div>
                     </div> The work's treatment of scripture offended Trimmer, but she was even more alarmed
                     by the educational philosophy that underwrote this treatment. As Godwin explains in
                     the preface to <em>Bible Stories</em>, religious lessons have been purposefully avoided in order "to interest the youthful
                     imagination" (315). For Trimmer, this decoupling was not merely profane; it was morally
                     catastrophic precisely because it encouraged unregulated fantasy. She rejected the
                     work out of hand and advised others to do the same: "we hope every parent […] will
                     discern <em>the folly</em>, as well as <em>wickedness, of leaving children to form their own principles and regulate their own
                        manners, without lesson or rule</em>, as the wild flights of an unbridled imagination shall direct" (211). For Godwin,
                     however, this detachment epitomized his belief that imagination and autonomy were
                     the bedrocks of youthful development; the qualities that Trimmer abhorred were, in
                     fact, the cornerstone of Godwin's entire system of education.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Alongside <em>The Enquirer,</em> Godwin regarded the preface to <em>Bible Stories</em> as his most comprehensive articulation of his pedagogical philosophy. He referred
                  Joseph V. Bevan to these two works in his "Letter of Advice to a Young American" (1818),
                  and the preface was the only aspect of his children's books to be included in his
                  collected works. As a document, it encapsulates a vision that Godwin had spent the
                  first part of his career contemplating. For Godwin, education was the origin of political
                  action. As he states in <em>The Enquirer</em>: "the cause of political reform, and the cause of intellectual and literary refinement,
                  are inseparably connected" (79). Social change required education, which catalyzed
                  intellectual and moral abilities.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Clemit summarizes Godwin's educational vision as contingent on three central ideas,
                     which, she argues, later shaped his children's books. 
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note26" id="Note26_return"><sup class="super">

                              “William Godwin's Juvenile Library,”
                              96-97.</span></div>
                     </div> First, Godwin argues that children's education should inculcate intellectual habits
                     rather than simply teach facts. Such habits will enable children to engage complicated
                     issues as mature adults; they will provide, as Godwin describes, "against the age
                     of five and twenty, a mind well regulated, active, and prepared to learn" (<em>Enquirer</em> 115). This prioritization, he believed, would help children learn to judge the world
                     around them according to the dictates of their conscience rather than an external
                     authority. The second idea of his educational vision is the commitment to children's
                     autonomy, especially in their choice of reading materials. Choosing their own books,
                     he argues, acclimatizes children to independent thought. Literature also encourages
                     imagination, the third tenet of his philosophy, and one that Godwin argued in the
                     preface to <em>Bible Stories</em> was central to the development of sympathy and morality (313-314).</p>
               </div>
               <p>This educational philosophy espoused a radically different concept of childhood than
                  that envisioned by Trimmer or More or even more liberal writers such as Wollstonecraft
                  or Barbauld. It rejects both the idea that children, born with the taint of Original
                  Sin, must learn submission and also the belief that children's educations required
                  constant management. Instead, Godwin trusts children to guide themselves even as he
                  recognizes the necessity of some adult supervision in learning. Godwin was conscious
                  of the problematic relationship between education and the type of personal autonomy
                  he felt would lead to intellectual curiosity, sympathy, and self-governance. As he
                  declares in <em>The Enquirer</em>: "It were to be wished that no human creature were obliged to do any thing but from
                  the dictates of his own understanding. But this seems to be, for the present at least,
                  impracticable in the education of youth," as children require teachers to explain
                  new concepts or complicated ideas (123-124). The answer, he argues, is to acknowledge
                  and then palliate this tyranny by allowing children to drive the course of learning
                  with their educators (whether teachers, parents, or books) serving as firm but mild
                  masters (<em>Enquirer</em> 122-123).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Autonomy, imagination, and intellect exist symbiotically in Godwin's paradigm: they
                     develop in response to each other as the child learns. While <em>The Enquirer</em> and preface to <em>Bible Stories</em> outline this philosophy, it also finds a clear expression in Godwin's novel <em>Fleetwood; or the New Man of Feeling</em> (1805), which devotes nearly a third of its narrative space to a discussion of learning.
                     The personal experiences of William Ruffigny—a central character that spends his childhood
                     working in a silk mill in Lyons— argue powerfully that intellectual freedom requires
                     physical freedom: "Every boy learns more in his hours of play, than in his hours of
                     labour. In school he lays in the materials of thinking; but in his sports he actually
                     thinks: he whets his faculties and he opens his eyes."

                     </div> Childish romping allows the mind to connect with and enliven the raw materials of
                     the schoolroom. More important, it enables an ingrained desire for mental freedom,
                     since "the mind of a child is no less vagrant than his steps; it pursues the gossamer,
                     and flies from object to object lawless and unconfined" (<em>Fleetwood</em> 150). While Trimmer fears that such unmanaged thoughts could lead to moral corruption,
                     Godwin regards them as necessary for the growth of mental and moral faculties.</p>
               </div>
               <p>As in <em>Fleetwood</em>, Godwin envisions a similar intellectual vagrancy in his educational writings, which
                  encourage pupils to "wander in the wilds of literature" without adult restraint (<em>Enquirer</em> 142). Unlike other educational writers, Godwin was confident that the benefits of
                  reading independently would outweigh any concerns about content or style (<em>Enquirer</em> 142). Literature held so central a place in Godwin's educational philosophy that
                  in <em>The Enquirer</em> he prioritizes it over other forms of instruction. The very format of the written
                  word, he insists, encourages rational, well-regulated minds. The diversity of books
                  available also proves useful: "Books gratify and excite our curiosity in innumerable
                  ways. They force us to reflect. They hurry us from point to point. They present direct
                  ideas of various kinds, and they suggest indirect ones" (<em>Enquirer</em> 142). Even as they encourage crucial intellectual habits, books also teach children
                  to sympathize with others by allowing them to project themselves into the experience
                  of the author or character, "to feel his feelings, and wish his wishes" (preface to
                  <em>Bible Stories</em> 313). It is this type of sympathy—imaginative and directed outward toward others—that
                  Godwin sees as critical to his moral philosophy. Better readers make better citizens,
                  and this process should begin as early as possible.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">IV. The Foundation and Productions of Godwin's Juvenile Library</span></h2>
               <p>Seen in this context, Godwin's turn to writing children's books is a natural outcome
                  of his educational vision. Godwin's first children's book, <em>Bible Stories,</em> was published in 1802 for Benjamin Tabart, a children's book publisher for whom Mary
                  Jane Godwin had prepared and translated texts in the years immediately following her
                  marriage to Godwin. Though published under Tabart's imprint, <em>Bible Stories</em> was a fitting genesis for the Godwins' Juvenile Library. Its criticisms of the contemporary
                  children's book market and suggestions for alternatives read as a call to arms for
                  the fresh type of educational literature that Godwin's own publishing company would
                  produce, one that encouraged the natural flexibility of young minds and resisted the
                  current drive toward juvenile literature preaching obedience, virtue, and accomplishment
                  over playfulness, accessibility, and imagination.</p>

                  <p>In 1805—the same year that <em>Fleetwood</em> was published—Godwin and his wife opened the Juvenile Library, a small store off Oxford

                     Percy Shelley).

                              with Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin (St Clair

                     market, by the advice of Godwin's friend Joseph Johnson, a radical publisher who had
                     enjoyed some success in producing children's books (including Wollstonecraft's <em>Original Stories from Real Life</em> in 1788), and by their friend, radical author Eliza Fenwick, who served briefly as
                     the shop's manager and contributed two titles to its roster.

                     </div> The business was initially registered under the name of Thomas Hodgkins, the store
                     manager, in order to disguise Godwin's involvement from the government and general
                     public, but when the Godwins discovered that Hodgkins was stealing from them, they
                     shifted ownership to Mary Jane. In 1807, the business moved to a new location at 41
                     Skinner Street, a run-down building within earshot of the public executions at Newgate
                     and close enough to Smithfield to reek of slaughter. The family lived in the upper
                     floors, and Godwin was careful never to be seen in the shop itself. It was renamed
                     the City Juvenile Library, and its front door and title pages carried the name of
                     M.J. Godwin, which St Clair conjectures might have been an obfuscating attempt to
                     attach themselves to the unrelated and respectable bookseller "John Godwin," since
                     passers-by seem to have read the plaque as "M<sup>r</sup>. J. Godwin" (<em>Godwins</em> 174). The business moved to 195 Strand in 1822, but failed in the financial crash
                     of 1825, the burden of having been funded almost entirely by loans swallowing all
                     its modest profits. Between its foundation in 1805 and its eventual dissolution in
                     1825, the Godwins (under both imprints) published only around sixty titles, but these
                     titles included such milestones as the Lambs' <em>Tales From Shakespear</em> and the first English translation of J.D. Wyss's <em>Swiss Family Robinson</em> (originally published as <em>The Family Robinson Crusoe</em>) as well as the ten books by Godwin himself, most of which ran into multiple editions
                     in England and the United States even after Godwin's death in 1836.

                  <p>The divide between Godwin's experiences writing about educational reform and producing
                     books to meet the needs of schools and schoolchildren was often striking. Much of
                     the Juvenile Library's success depended upon the lucrative business of supplying textbooks
                     to schools, requiring Godwin to negotiate the delicate territory between publishing
                     books that would reflect his own philosophies and would succeed in the competitive
                     schoolbook market. Confronting the realities of readers who differed in class, gender,
                     and educational backgrounds from the abstract child he envisions in <em>The Enquirer</em> likely refined Godwin's education vision; at the very least, they forced him to moderate
                     the content of the books he published. Such negotiations are visible in a letter to
                     Charles Lamb in which Godwin insists that Lamb curtail the gore present in his manuscript
                     of <em>The Voyage of Ulysses</em> (1808) on the grounds that such violence would make the text impossible to sell to
                     girls' schools: <span class="quote">‘We live in squeamish days. Amid the beauties of your manuscript, of which no man can

                     he worries that the work's present carnage will deter young women (and their families
                     and teachers) from purchasing it; he is concerned about the potential fiscal consequences
                     of Lamb's rhetoric. As an educator, though, he fears that such revulsion will lead
                     to deficits in young women's knowledge of the classics; since girls were rarely taught
                     ancient languages, retellings like Lamb's might be their only exposure to Homer.

               </div>
               <p>Though <em>Bible Stories</em> was never reissued under Godwin's own imprint, it serves as a template for his later
                  children's books. Godwin consciously eschewed a theological framework on the grounds
                  that his intended audience were not developmentally ready to learn about religion:
                  "The mysteries of religion […] are not proper topics upon which to exercise the imperfect
                  and infant understanding of children." He claims that introducing children to "the
                  abstrusenesses of scripture, before his mind was ripe enough to feel its merits" will
                  merely disgust them (preface to <em>Bible Stories</em> 314). Instead, he detaches religion from the religious narratives, presenting the
                  bible "merely as historical, as tales of ancient times" since "there are no stories
                  in the world so exquisitely fitted to interest the youthful imagination" than those
                  found in scripture (315). When presented as a "posy of sweet smelling flowers, with
                  out one shrub of evil scene, or a single thorn," scripture becomes a developmentally
                  adaptable means to learn about religion (315). The lack of a moralizing narrator accords
                  an unprecedented autonomy to children and to their parents. Depending on the child,
                  the text can serve as a means to explain the nature of God or simply as a collection
                  of adventure stories devoid of any supernatural associations. This treatment of sacred
                  scripture as secular literature antagonized Godwin's contemporary critics, especially
                  Trimmer. Nonetheless, its preface remains one of Godwin's most straightforward assessments
                  of his own children's literature as a new—and necessary—intervention in the genre.
                  All of Godwin's Juvenile Library productions share <em>Bible Stories</em>' core projects: to reject the prevalent trend towards didacticism in children's literature;
                  to provide a literary alternative adapted to children's capacities and designed to
                  engage their attention; and to raise the type of thinking, feeling populace he envisions
                  in <em>Political Justice</em> and his other works. In effect, his children's books sought to plant the seeds of
                  dissent and intellectual autonomy in a new generation of readers.</p>

               <p>Such references are not anomalous. As Clemit argues, Godwin's children's books contain
                  numerous, subtle, but discernible moments of subversion, the very qualities suggested
                  by the spy report with which this study opens (
                  “Philosophical Anarchism”
                  47). Despite his flaws as a businessman, Godwin was acutely aware that outright radicalism
                  would spell disaster for the venture on which his family's livelihood depended. Just
                  as he could not claim authorship of these texts or ownership of the Juvenile Library
                  itself, nor could he safely publish materials that openly questioned King, Church,
                  Parliament, or the supremacy of any of those institutions. Yet, the author of <em>Political Justice</em> and the authors Scolfield, Baldwin, and Marcliffe were very much the same man, and
                  the Juvenile Library productions ask, and at times require, young readers to question
                  the world around them.</p>

                     to his readers, instead adopting a simple and direct style to inspire reflection.
                     He also radically edits or completely re-conceptualizes these stories. For example,
                     he insists on providing his readers with "happy and forgiving" endings, often resulting
                     in fables that seem to lack a moral compass. This apparent lack of guidance infuriated
                     Trimmer, who claimed that <em>Fables</em>' happy endings "prevent the proper discrimination betwixt <em>virtue</em> and <em>vice</em>, which children should be led to make at as early a period as possible […] the public
                     is presented with a set of <em>fanciful stories</em>, destitute, for the most part, of <em>moral</em>, and everything else that should characterize a Fable Book."

                     and, at times, to arrive at their own conclusion even before the characters do. The

                              the mistress and president of obscenity" (108). See Tooke, Pantheon, 38th ed. 1798.</span></div>
                     </div> Unlike Tooke's "elaborate calumny upon the Gods of the Greeks […] in the coarsest
                     thoughts and words that rancour could furnish," Godwin's text glows with respect for
                     the characters, customs, and ideas of the ancient world. In so doing, he suggests
                     to his young readers that the modern world can, in fact, learn from the pagan past.
                     Moreover, unlike other mythologies, the title page of Godwin's <em>Pantheon</em> addresses itself to "young persons of both sexes," opening the beauties of the classical
                     world to girls as well as boys.

                  <p>The last paragraph of the <em>Pantheon</em>'s preface provides a précis of Godwin's goals for his text: <span class="quote">‘The uses of the study of ancient mythology are, 1. to enable young persons to understand
                        the system of the poets of former times, as well as the allusions so often to be found
                        interspersed in writers of a more recent date: 2. as a collection of the most agreeable
                        fables that ever were invented, it is admirably calculated to awaken the imagination;
                        imagination, which it cannot be too often repeated, is the great engine of morality:
                        3. it presents us with an instructive lesson on the nature of the human mind, laying
                        before us the manners and prejudices of a nation extremely different from our own,
                        and showing us to what extravagant and fantastic notions of the invisible world the
                        mind, once bewildered in error, may finally be led.

                        </div>’</span> Here, Godwin returns to some of his favorite themes: the fact that these tales are
                     valuable because "agreeable" to young minds, the idea that imagination (that "great
                     engine of morality") is essential to child readers, and the idea that children can
                     benefit from observing cultural differences. The final sentence can be read as both
                     a defense of his project and, in a broader sense, a swipe at his own, modern world;
                     the idea of minds "bewildered in error" and in need of guidance suggests a stark comparison
                     between the classical world that Godwin's text venerates and his own war-torn and
                     divided nation.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Baldwin's other major works —<em>The History of England</em> (1806), <em>History of Rome</em> (1809), and <em>History of Greece</em> (1821)—continued to entertain young readers while challenging their assumptions. These
                     texts' emphases on reflection, rather than the rote memorization of facts, made them
                     innovative within their contemporary market. In these histories, aspects of Godwin's
                     political agenda become clearer. In <em>The History of England</em> (1806), for example, Godwin devotes a chapter to Oliver Cromwell, and according to
                     his chapter heading, Cromwell "<span style="font-variant: small-caps">governed this nation with more vigour and glory, than any king that ever sat upon
                        the throne.</span>" Similarly, Godwin's chapter on the aftermath of the War of the Roses ends with a
                     leading question that he refuses to answer: "Was he [Perkin Warbeck] the Duke of York,
                     or was he an imposter? in other words, Which was the true murderer, Richard III, or
                     his accuser, Henry VII? This is one of the most difficult questions in history."

                              character of Perkin Warbeck in her novel The Fortunes of Perkin Warbeck (1830), in
                              which the pretender is portrayed as the legitimate heir to the throne. Godwin's chapter
                              devoted to Cromwell is on pages 138 through 141 of the 1806 edition.</span></div>
                     </div> By withholding an answer to this "difficult question," Godwin simultaneously challenges
                     his young readers to think critically about national history and to question the institution
                     of the monarchy itself. <em>The History of England</em> contains other critiques of royal power. Godwin, for example, first describes Edward
                     III as "like too many other kings and heads of nations, he desired to be a conqueror"
                     and then immediately defines "conqueror" as "a man who sallies forth at the head of
                     an army, to disturb the peace and repose of honest, unoffending husbandmen, peasants
                     and artisans: he causes the death of thousands, and reduces nations to slavery, that
                     he may become famous and have songs made in his praise" (79-80). Similarly, in the
                     chapter on James I, Godwin depicts that monarch as a "pedant" who was "not fit" for
                     rule. Godwin describes James's declaration "that <em>it would be sedition in them</em> [Parliament] <em>to dispute what a king might do in the heights of his power"</em> as "very foolish talk," a passage which not only suggests that a king can be foolish,
                     but also flatly rejects the power of the monarchy over Parliament (128).

                     </div> Such persistent questioning of institutions makes <em>The History of England</em> as much of a treatise on contemporary politics as a lesson in history.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In that same year, but under the Marcliffe pseudonym, Godwin also produced <em>Life of Lady Jane Grey and of Lord Guilford Dudley, her Husband</em> (1806), a hybrid of history and biography. Like <em>The History of England</em>, it repeatedly condemns religious zealots and praises its primary subject, represented
                  as an educated, free-thinking woman victimized by small-minded reactionaries and a
                  tyrannical ruler. A similar theme is pursued in <em>The Looking-Glass</em> (1805), Godwin's paean to his illustrator William Mulready, which provides artistic
                  child-readers with an example to emulate (an idea hammered home by the epigraph from
                  Shakespeare: "Emulation has a thousand sons"). <em>History of Rome</em> (1809) and <em>History of Greece</em> (1821) are also noteworthy for their attempts to establish early democratic principles
                  as ideals that were innate and are still applicable to the nineteenth century (a particularly
                  pertinent claim for the last title, published in during the War of Greek Independence).
                  Unlike most contemporary publications, these histories and biographies insist that
                  history should be learned not merely by the memorization of facts but through reflection
                  on ideas. They also planted seeds in their young readers: the ideas that the monarchy
                  should be questioned, that power can be abused, and that attention paid to the lessons
                  of the past can make for better citizens of the future.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Godwin was never accused of being a shrewd businessman: although moderately successful
                     in terms of sales and contracts, the Juvenile Library was founded almost entirely
                     on borrowed money. Godwin often took a flippant attitude towards matters of finance,
                     and, as Kinnnell explains, the company did not sufficiently advertise in provincial
                     newspapers, thereby missing a valuable, growing market of rural readers (80). 
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note47" id="Note47_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div> These forces combined with the market crash of 1825 to bankrupt the business, which
                     closed its doors in that year. Despite its failure as a business, the books published
                     by the Juvenile Library profoundly contributed both to the contemporary children's
                     book market and to our understanding of Godwin's own educational and philosophical
                     ideas.</p>
               </div>
               <p>When viewed in light of his particular political and social milieu and the general
                  atmosphere of change surrounding publishing and childhood in the early nineteenth
                  century, Godwin's books for children must be read as an extension of his political
                  writings, which themselves became increasingly focused on the role of education in
                  social change. <em>Political Justice</em>'s idea that human progress starts with individuals, not institutions, situates Godwin's
                  professed faith in his young readers as autonomous creatures in a new and decidedly
                  politicized context; it forms the foundation to his later writings for adults <em>and</em> for children. For if—as Godwin believed—behavior is determined by opinion, and opinion
                  is determined by cultural environment, then literature can shape that environment
                  and thus the basic fabric of society. The panicked claims of a government spy in 1813
                  are not entirely unfounded. Godwin did indeed strive to make his books widely available
                  to schoolchildren in order to spread ideals of democracy; he did promote the values
                  of Greece and Rome and attempt to make them available to all children of either sex
                  and any class; and he did view his publishing venture as a means to disseminate "every
                  principle professed by the infidels and republicans of these days" (qtd in Mac-Carthy
                  164). By producing and promoting literature that encourages children to think for
                  themselves, question alleged truths, and value their imaginative faculties, Godwin
                  continued to spread radical ideas and, more importantly, incorporated them into a
                  realistic pedagogical methodology that was successfully bequeathed to the next generation.</p>

               than has previously been thought (93). Moreover, she notes, new editions of Godwin's
               works continued to appear even after Godwin sold off his stock to Baldwin, Craddock,
               and Joy in 1825 (98). Of note among these is the <em>Pantheon</em>, which Clemit explains went through eight editions by 1836 and became "a standard

               with the dour, didactic fiction of the 1780s and 1790s drowning out the more playful,
               imaginative fiction from earlier in the century. However, in 
               “Wordsworth, Fairy Tales, and the Politics of Children's Reading,”
               Richardson argues that scholars need to be more aware of the way in which this post-romantic
               scholarly narrative influences our reading of children's literary history, in particular
               the way in which we see late-century didactic children's fiction.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note18_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               Month 20th 1824," indicating that at least some English editions crossed the Atlantic.
