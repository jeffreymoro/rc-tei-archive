            <p>PREFACE.</p>
            
            <p>ENCOURAGED by the general acceptance which my <hi rend="italics">Fables, Ancient
                    and Modern</hi>, have found with the public, I have been excited to try how far
                a similar mode of familiar and playful writing might be successfully applied in the
                composition of History. Too long have books, designed for the instruction of
                children, been written in a dry and repulsive style, which the patience and
                perseverance of our maturer years would scarcely enable us to conquer. Too long have
                their tender memories been loaded with a variety of minute particulars, which, as
                they excite no passion in the mind, and present no picture, can be learned only to
                forget. I have lately seen Grammars of Geography, and Grammars of History, in which
                these faults, if they are faults, are carried to a height hitherto unequalled.</p>
            <p> I have one criterion by which to form my judgment in these matters; and I will here
                plainly communicate it for the benefit of parents and instructors. I hold that those
                particulars of which an [end a2] accomplished gentleman and a scholar may without
                dishonour confess that he has no recollection, are a superfluity with which it is
                quite unnecessary to load the memory of a child. I have seen children, who can
                explain minutely the process of various manufactures, who can tell from what country
                we get our cochineal, and currently recite the particulars of the balance of trade
                between England and the four quarters of the globe. This certainly is not the very
                first branch of a liberal education.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See See
                    Barnett’s and Gustafson’s introduction to this edition, “The Radical Aesop: William Godwin and the Juvenile Library,
                        1805-1825,” for more on Godwin’s views on inspiring or enlivening
                    children’s studies, as well as a few examples of the kinds of “grammars of
                    geography” and “grammars of history” he mentions here.</note>

            <p> It is not the boast of this little book that it contains a catalogue of five
                thousand remarkable events. My pages are not crouded with a variety of articles:
                they are so printed as to be agreeable and refreshing to the eye of a child.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                    
                    <hi rend="italic">My pages are not crouded with a variety of articles: they are
                        so printed as to be agreeable and refreshing to the eye of a child</hi>:
                    Godwin appears to be drawing on a practice attributed to Anna Barbauld of
                    reducing the amount of printed matter per page so as not to overwhelm child
                    readers. Barbauld typically used this practice in her primers, such as <hi
                        rend="italic">Lessons for Children of Two to Three Years </hi>(London: 1787)
                    or <hi rend="italic">Lessons for Children of Three to Four Years </hi>(London:
                    1788). Godwin adopts the practice here for what would likely have been an older
                    audience of readers. For further information on Barbauld’s practice see William
                    McCarthy, “Mother of all Discourses: Anna Barbauld’s Lessons for Children,” in
                        <hi rend="italic">Culturing the Child</hi>, <hi rend="italic">1690-1914,

                    Scarecrow Press, 2005).</note> I wished to give him a bird's eye view
                of the History of England, not to exhibit it by the aid of a microscope. For this
                reason I seldom or ever found it necessary to take down a book from my shelf as I
                wrote. I had nothing to do but with the great landmarks of history which can never
                be forgotten, and the strong impression which, once received, can never be
                    obliterated.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                    Throughout his historical writings, Godwin argues that the historian’s task must
                    go beyond the description of facts to articulate the “individual” character of
                    important historical events and persons. In his unpublished 1797 essay “Of
                    History and Romance,” Godwin notes that history ought to represent its subjects
                    as “composed of materials merely human” (<hi rend="italic">Caleb Williams</hi>,
                    “Appendix A” 456) so that the “contemplation of illustrious men” might provide a
                    “fruitful source of activity and motive” that “kindles into a flame the hidden
                    fire within us[….] There must be an exchange of real sentiments […] before
                    improvement can be the result” (458). For further discussions of the method of
                    “individual” history, see Godwin’s prefaces to his <hi rend="italic">‪</hi><hi

                        rend="italic">Political Justice</hi>, Godwin claims that a child’s
                    intellectual improvement can only occur where her mind “be advanced to the
                    height of knowledge already existing among the enlightened members of the
                    community.” This cultivates the child’s propensity for critical inquiry,
                    encouraging both “the pursuit of further acquisitions” and the notion that all
                    ideas are “open to review” (1798, II: 299-300). On Godwin’s views concerning the
                    formation of proper intellectual habits in children and the benefits of
                    historical reading more broadly, see also <hi rend="italic">The Enquirer.

                my narrative to skim over the surface of events, the reader will be surprised, when
                he comes to look at the Tables at the end of the volume, to see how great a mass of
                information this book contains. I am not without hope that the young reader will
                learn more from my pages, than from some productions on the same subject in two or
                three crowded volumes in twelves *.</p>
            <p> Moliere, when he wrote his admirable comedies, was accustomed to read them in
                manuscript to an old woman, his housekeeper, and be always found that, where the old
                woman laughed or was out of humour, there the audiences laughed or were out of
                humour also. In the same manner I am accustomed to consult my children in this
                humble species of writing in which I have engaged. I put the two or three first
                sections of this work into their hands as a specimen. Their remark was,<hi
                    rend="italic">How easy this is! Why, we learn it by heart, almost as fast as we
                    read it!</hi> Their suffrage gave me courage, and I carried on my work to the
                end. </p>
            <p>*For a specimen of the manner in which this outline might advantageously be filled up
                for children, in those parts which are peculiarly instructive and interesting, the
                reader is referred to the <ref
                    target="https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/780a52cb-d888-913f-e040-e00a18064a23"
                    >Life of Lady Jane Grey by Theophilus Marcliffe</ref>. [end v]</p>
            <p> Judging from the experiment of my own children, I am led to imagine that the
                sections of this volume might easily, as well as usefully, be committed to memory.
                The Tables at the end, are intended merely to fix the pupil's recollection of what
                he has previously learned. They may also convey to the inexperienced reader a vivid
                feeling, that there are other countries beside England, and other histories worthy
                to be read. In a word, they obviously serve as an introduction and remote prospect
                to the whole magazine of human sciences and arts. [end page vi]</p>

           <p> THE history of the world is divided into Ancient and Modern History: the birth of
                Christ, who was the great author of the Christian religion, is the event at which
                Ancient History ends, and Modern History begins.</p>
            <p> The inhabitants of Britain before Christ wrote no books; therefore all that we know
                about them is obscure and imperfect. [end 11]</p>
            <p> The best writers of books in the period before Christ were the Greeks and Romans:
                the Greeks wrote something about the Ancient Britons; but the first accurate account
                was written by Julius Caesar emperor of Rome, about fifty years before Christ.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Godwin refers to <hi rend="italic">Commentarii

                    with it.</note>
            </p>
            <p> The first inhabitants of Britain, that we know any thing about, came over from
                France, anciently called Gaul: they had among them a set of learned men called
                Druids.</p>
            <p> These learned men perhaps could neither read nor write; but they studied the stars,
                and the system of the heavens, commonly called astronomy; and they composed so many
                verses upon astronomy, and history, and morality, and religion, and other subjects,
                that Julius Caesar says it took their pupils twenty years to learn them all by
                heart: the Druids were lovers [end 12] of Gods and good things, and taught valuable
                precepts to their scholars.</p>
            <p> As the time when the Druids flourished in Britain was before Christ, they could not
                be Christians; they were very devout, said many prayers, sung many hymns, and made
                many sacrifices: I am sorry to say, that they sometimes sacrificed (that is, killed)
                men at their altars, and thought to please their Gods by it: the principal objects
                of their worship were the sun, moon and stars.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

            <p> The Romans made quite another thing of Britain from what they found it: the Britons
                lived in mean huts, and when many of these stood together, they dug a deep ditch
                round the whole, and called it a town: there remains however of the Ancient Britons
                the ruin of several stupendous structures built for religious purposes: the chief of
                these is Stone-henge on Salisbury Plain.</p>
            <p> The Romans built beautiful towns in many parts of England in the best [end 14] style
                of architecture, and adorned them with theatres, palaces and temples; so that
                Britain became in length of time almost as fine as Italy itself: Greek was studied
                here, and Latin became the ordinary language: the Romans were fond of teaching us,
                and found us very apt scholars: Constantine the Great and others, were advanced from
                the government of Britain to the throne of the empire.</p>

            <p> Constantine the Great, established the Christian religion in Rome, about the year of

                the people the doctrines of Christ and his apostles: the Roman government in Britain

                to the most disgraceful excesses: under their republican government they were free,
                [end 16] under the emperors they were slaves: in the former period they conquered
                the world, in the latter they were conquered themselves.</p>

            <p> Britain was seized by the Saxons, who came from the shores of the Baltic to this

                of their success, and followed their example; one part of England was seized by them
                after another; and the Saxons erected seven kingdoms in England, which are called
                the Heptarchy.</p>
            <p> The barbarous Saxons abolished the Christian religion among us: they were quite as
                successful in teaching us ignorance, as the Romans had been in teaching us
                knowledge: the very ideas of the Christian God and his son were lost: and historians
                have supposed that, soon after the death of king Arthur, not a book was to be found
                in the island.</p>
            <p> The Saxons however had a religion of their own, and Woden or Odin was [end 19] their
                principal God; the names of several of their Gods are preserved to us in the names
                of the days of the week, Sunday and Monday are the days of the Sun and Moon, Tuesday
                is Tuisco's day, Wednesday the day of Woden, Thursday of Thor, Friday of Friga and
                Saturday of Sater: it is usual to consider the Saxons as more peculiarly our
                ancestors than either the Britons of Romans; because they were Angles, we are called
                English; and, though the language they spoke (which was the Saxon) has changed its
                name among us, it differs not otherwise from that we speak now, than as almost all
                languages alter in the course of some hundred years.</p>
            <p> In the year 596 the pope of Rome sent over some monks to convert the Saxons to the
                Roman Catholic faith: they went from one kingdom of Heptarchy to another, and in a
                short time all the Saxons became Christians; [end 20] the better sort learned to
                read and write; England produced students and authors, and gradually became adorned
                with churches, monasteries and cathedrals.</p>
            <p> Monasteries are large houses full of monks or nuns, people who have taken a vow
                never to marry, and to spend all their lives in saying their prayers, and reading
                good books.</p>
            
            <p><hi rend="center">THE MONARCHY.</hi></p>
            <p> IN the year 800 Egbert, king of the West of England, put an end to the Heptarchy,
                and made himself first king of England.</p>
            <p> His grandson, Alfred, was the noblest king that ever sat on this, or perhaps any
                other throne: he collected all the good laws that had ever been made by any of his
                Saxon ancestors, and caused them to be observed: the [end 21] Saxons, though a
                barbarous people, were endowed with good sense, and cultivated the love of liberty
                in the dark and unpleasant climate they came from: many of their laws are excellent,
                and are the laws and principles of the English government to this day.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The ninth-century ACE Doom Book or Code of
                    Alfred is the foundation for subsequent English Common Law.</note></p>
            
            <p> They were times of great barbarism that Alfred lived in: he did not learn to read
                till he was nine years old, and then only because he begged to be taught: there were
                no clocks in the island, and Alfred invented a way of measuring time by candles
                which were made to burn eight hours apiece: he allowed himself eight hours in every
                day for sleep and his meals: eight hours for study, and eight hours for the public
                duties of his government; which he discharged with an exactness, an impartiality,
                and a wisdom, that almost exceeded human capacity. [end 22]</p>
            
            <p><hi rend="center">THE DANES.</hi></p>
            <p> BUT Alfred was not allowed to spend his life in exertions to promote the private
                happiness of his countrymen: the Danes, who inhabited almost exactly the same region
                from which the Saxons had come, sailed over to Britain in their ships, with an
                inclination to treat the Saxons now, as the Saxons had treated the Britons before:
                at one time they were so successful, that Alfred lost his army, and was obliged to
                hide himself for weeks in the disguise of a servant in a poor man's cottager: it was
                here that the cottager's wife gave him a scolding, for letting her cakes be burned
                while he sat by the fire where they were toasting.</p>
            <p> From this retreat he contrived to send messages to his friends, and got together a
                new army: he then dressed himself like a harper (a singer of fine [end 23] old
                ballads like Chevy Chase, to the music of his harp<note place="foot" resp="editors"> “The Ballad of Chevy Chase” describes an ill-fated hunting party led by
                    Percy, the English Earl of Northumberland in in the Cheviot Hills along the

                    was widely disseminated in chapbook form throughout the eighteenth century.
                    Joseph Addison wriote in the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> in 1711 that “the
                    old song of ‘Chevy-Chase’ is the favourite ballad of the common people of
                    England, and Ben Jonson used to say he had rather have been the author of it
                    than of all his works” (<hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> No. 70, May 21,
                    1711).</note>), and went into the Danish camp: there he played and sung before
                the king: and, having found that the Danes, now they saw no enemy, minded nothing
                but dancing and drinking and amusements, he went away, and came back with his
                soldiers, defeated the Danes, and obliged them to go home to the shores of the
                Baltic.</p>
            <p> The Danes were a braver race of men than the Saxons: when the Saxons came over to
                Britain, and settled among the remnants of Roman luxury, they grew effeminate; when
                they became Christians, it was but a poor religion that the tyrannical popes and
                ignorant monks taught them, and they lost the fine old songs and ballads, which
                celebrated the courage and virtues of their ancestors, that they had learned at
                home: the monks told them they must sing nothing but Psalms. [end 24]</p>
            <p> The Danes, who staid at home in their northern climate, amidst stupendous rocks and
                wild scenery, continued to sing the songs of their ancestors, and made better: their
                poets are called Scalds, and their compositions the Runic or Scandinavian poetry:
                some fine specimens of it have been put into English by Gray, author of theElegy in

            <p> The Danes felt a singular animosity to the Christian religion, especially to the
                monasteries in which so many persons of both sexes lived in idleness and [end 25]
                effeminacy: one measure which marked the progress of the Danes wherever they came,

                frequent and formidable: the pusillanimous Saxons gave them money to go away, and
                the Danes, when they had spent what they carried off, came back to get more: Alfred
                died in the year 900; and about a hundred years afterward Canute, king of Denmark,
                made a complete conquest of England, and after a reign of eighteen years in this
                country, left the crown to his sons: the Danes had by this time embraced the
                Christian faith.</p>
            <p> The sons of Canute died without children; in consequence of which the Saxon royal
                family resumed the throne [end 26] in the person of Edward the Confessor: in his

                    Though Godwin remains critical of the economic and cultural inequalities

            <p> William the Conqueror, when he became king of England, continued duke of Normandy,
                that is, lord (in subordination to the king of France) [end 32] of a valuable
                division of that country: his successors acquired other provinces in France, till
                they became feudal, or inferior, lords of a third part of that kingdom.</p>
            <p> A feudal lordship was at first a very humble and dependent station: the person who
                held it was bound to perform certain menial offices for his superior, such as taking
                care of his dogs, superintending his wardrobe, or airing his shirt (hence come our
                master of the horse, groom of the stole, and lord of the bed-chamber); he swore the
                obedience, on his bended knees, and with his joined hands put between the hands of
                his lord-paramount; when he died, his successor paid a fine to be permitted to have
                the land, and if he were under age, was placed at the direction of his superiors;
                but the feudal lords grew more and more powerful, till they became little less than
                kings, each over his inheri- [end 33] tance, and seldom paid much attention to those

                    <hi rend="italic">Ignorance however is not inconsistent with zeal</hi>: Godwin’s
                    views here echo any number of standard Enlightenment criticisms of religion,
                    which he would have encountered in the French atheists whom he names as

                        Justice</hi>’s gradualist view of social progress; contrary to the
                    intellectually “premature” (1798, I: 272) conditions which give birth to the
                    “headlong zeal” that animates violent revolutions (1798, I: 361), Godwin argues
                    that social improvement can only occur “in a just proportion to the illumination
                    of public understanding” (1798, I: 273).</note>: they were shocked when they

                death, and the tomb in which his body had been laid, was in the hands of unbelieving
                Saracens, the followers of Mahomet.</p>
            <p> Pilgrimages were the fashion of this age: the well-meaning, but uninstructed, people
                who then lived, were accustomed to address separate prayers to every saint in
                heaven; and these prayers were supposed to have the more merit, if they were said at
                the tomb, where the bones of the saint had been laid to rest: if any body had done a
                wicked thing the remembrance of which made him uneasy, he thought, and the priest
                encouraged him to think so, that if he made a pilgrimage to some celebrated tomb, or
                shrine, which was perhaps a hundred miles off, and especially if he went to it
                barefoot, the saint would prevail upon God Almighty to forgive [end 36] him his sin:
                it was the same way of thinking that induced them to whip themselves, to wear shirts
                of horsehair, and to make the naked stones their beds; they believed that, if they
                punished themselves, God would be satisfied and pardon them.</p>
            <p> If the religious in this age made pilgrimages to the shrines of so many saints, you
                may think that they imputed a higher merit to a visit to Jerusalem, where Jesus
                Christ, the Saviour of the world, died, and was buried: the Saracens, from
                civilisation and refinement, andbecause the resort of Christian pilgrims brought
                wealth into their country, tolerated and accommodated them: but when, ten years
                after the Conquest, the Turks took Jerusalem from the Saracens, they treated the
                Christian pilgrims with rudeness and barbarity.</p>
            <p> In resentment of this insolence, a [end 37] million of Christians joined from the
                different countries of Europe, and set out for the conquest of Jerusalem, which
                surrendered to their arms in the year 1099: Tasso, the best of the modern Italian

            <p> Robert, duke of Normandy, was one of the commanders in this undertaking; and the
                better to enable him to raise his forces, he sold the government of his duchy during
                his absence, to William Rufus, for a sum of money. William Rufus, like most men of
                rank in this age, when amusements were so few, was very fond of hunting: one day
                when he was engaged in the pleasures of the chace in the New Forest, news was
                brought him that one of his barons in Normandy had taken up arms against his
                government: William was so enraged at what he heard, that he turned his horse's
                head, [end 38] and rode immediately to the next port; when he came there, the
                weather was cloudy and tempestuous, and the sailors were not willing to put to sea;
                William however insisted; he leaped into the vessel, and asked in a boastful sort of
                a tone, whether they had ever heard of a king who was drowned?</p>
            <p> Another accident happened to him in the New Forest: Walter Tyrrel, one of his
                courtiers, was hunting with the king, and shot at a stag the arrow glanced against a
                tree, which changed its direction; it struck the king upon his breast, and he fell

            <p> WHEN William Rufus was killed, Robert duke of Normandy was absent in the Holy Land:
                Henry, the youngest son of William the Conqueror, took advantage of this
                circumstance: he hastened from the New Forest to Winchester, where he got possession
                of the public treasure and thence to London, where he got himself crowned.</p>
            <p> Robert hurried home, as soon as he heard of the death of William Rufus, and once
                more tried by the sword to gain the crown of England: but he not only failed in
                this, but soon after lost Normandy, where he had at first been gladly received:
                Henry took him prisoner, and put him in confinement, where he remained for the rest
                of his life, twenty-eight years. [end 40]</p>
            <p> Henry Beauclerc had an only son, named William, whom he loved very much, but who was
                lost at sea at eighteen years of age. Henry was so affected at this event, that,
                though he outlived it fifteen years, it is remarked that he was never seen to smile
                afterward.</p>

            <p> ENGLAND had never yet been governed by a queen; and some countries, France for
                instance, have always refused their sceptre to a woman; so Stephen, grandson to
                William the Conqueror by [end 41] a daughter, thought he would try his chance with
                the empress Maud: Maud was out of England, and Stephen got one of Henry's ministers
                to swear, that to his knowledge the king wished Stephen to be his successor: so
                Stephen was crowned.</p>
            <p> By and by Maud came over with the army, and there was a great deal of fighting
                between her and her cousin: once she took Stephen prisoner; and twice she escaped
                being taken herself, the first time from Oxford by dressing herself in white, and
                walking at night over the snow, and the second time out of Wallingford in a coffin:
                at last it was agreed that Stephen should reign all the days of his life, and that
                Henry, son of the empress Maud by her second husband Geoffrey Plantagenet, should
                succeed him.</p>
            <p> The fierce and haughty barons took advantage of the unsettled state of the [end 42]
                kingdom under Stephen, and built themselves each a strong castle for fortress to the
                number of eleven hundred and fifteen: thus they took all power into their own hands,
                and reduced the prerogative of the king to almost nothing: beside this, they were
                continually quarrelling and fighting with each other, so that poor England looked
                like a country of savages. [end 43]</p>

                by whom he had
                several children: queen Eleanor was very jealous of her; and, as the story goes, the
                king made a bower for her to live in at Woodstock in the midst of a labyrinth, so
                contrived that nobody could find the way through it except they were in the secret;
                queen Eleanor got herself instructed, and went into the bower with a sword in one
                hand, and a bowl of poison in the other, and told Fair Rosamond that she might
                choose by which of them she would die; Rosamond took the poison and expired.</p>
            <p> Henry had another great quarrel with Thomas à Becket: he saw how much the church in
                these dark ages [end 45] was disposed to domineer over the state, and how the popes
                made and unmade kings; and he set his heart upon remedying so disgraceful an
                evil.</p>
            <p> The way it had grown was this: the pope of Rome, and the bishops and monks all over
                Europe, made a common cause, and agreed that whatever would add power to the one,
                would add power to the other: so that the popes of Rome acquired an authority,
                something like that of the emperors of Rome in the days of their prosperity, and had
                an army of priests and monks scattered in every quarter, who adhered as faithfully
                to their chief, as ever the body-guard of a sovereign did to the monarch who paid
                them.</p>
            <p> Henry determined to break this league: he had a minister Thomas à Becket, who was
                exceedingly clever, and had never disobliged him in any thing: he thought, if he
                could once raise this [end 46] man to the highest dignity of the church in England,
                and make him archbishop of Canterbury, every thing else that he wished would follow
                of course.</p>
            <p> You cannot think upon how familiar terms this able king and his clever minister
                lived with each other: one day as they were riding on horseback through the streets
                of London, they observed a beggar shivering with the cold:<hi rend="italic">Would it
                    not be a good action,</hi> said the king, <hi rend="italic">to give that poor
                    fellow a warm coat in this hard season? That it would</hi>, said Becket; <hi
                    rend="italic">and your majesty does well to think of such charitable actions:
                    Then he shall have one presently</hi>, replied Henry, and with that, gave a
                smart pluck to Becket's cloak: the minister pulled it close about him, and defended
                himself as well as he could, till both king and minister had like to have been down
                in [end 47] the dirt: at length Becket, like a good courtier, let go his hold, and
                the king gave the cloak to the beggar: it was made of scarlet, and lined with
                ermine: the beggar knew nothing of the quality of the persons he saw, and was not a
                little surprised at the nature of the present.</p>
            <p> Becket was as great a patron of learning as the king; and, while Henry encouraged
                the French writers, his minister contracted a strict intimacy with the best authors
                in Latin he could meet with: Joseph of Exeter, his friend, composed a very tolerable
                poem on the Trojan war,<note place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph of Exeter’s

                the age in which he wrote: Becket lived in a very splendid manner, and spent his
                leisure-hours in hunting, hawking and horsemanship: this man, for the reasons that
                have been mentioned, Henry made archbishop of Canterbury. [end 48]</p>
            <p> Whether Becket gave any promises to the king I cannot tell, but if he did he
                certainly broke them all: he no sooner received this preferment, than he determined
                within himself the plan he would pursue: if he had answered the king's wishes, he
                would have been spoken ill of and hated by all the clergy of Europe; they would have
                called him a false brother, an apostate, a tool, and an atheist: this was by no
                means Becket's intention; he wished to be honoured, and not to be despised.</p>
            <p> I suppose too Becket had some religious feelings concerned in the change that now
                took place: he thought that a courtier and a minister might take some liberties in
                his way of living, but that a different conduct was due from the first clergyman of
                a great country: according to the religious notions of those times, he laid aside
                all his pomp, wore sackcloth next to his skin, and fed [end 49] upon nothing but
                bread, water and herbs: he whipped himself often and severely, as a punishment for
                his sins; and, in imitation of what we read of Jesus Christ, washed the feet of a
                certain number of beggars every day: Thomas à Becket soon passed for the first saint
                in the land.</p>
            <p> Henry, having thus, as he thought, secured himself a staunch friend in the head of
                the church, brought up a law to prohibit appeals to Rome, and other practices by
                which England was made dependent on the pope: who do you think was the principal
                person that opposed this measure? Thomas à Becket. He said, that he owed all manner
                of obligations and deference to the king, but that he could not betray the duties of
                his station; he would die sooner than yield: the quarrel grewhotter and hotter: the
                king seized all the arch- [end 50] bishop's estates, and Becket was obliged to fly
                beyond sea.</p>
            <p> The pope and the king of France received Becket with great love, and determined to
                carry him through is difficulties: the clergy and a great part of the people of
                England thought the king acted very wickedly, in quarrelling with and banishing so
                good a man: Henry was obliged to submit: he gave up the law he wanted to establish:
                Becket and he met in Normandy, and seemed to be friends.</p>
            <p> The king staid in Normandy, while Becket passed over in triumph to his palace and
                cathedral of Canterbury: Henry could not help muttering to himself what an
                ungrateful and troublesome subject he had got: a wicked, slave-spirited courtier
                overheard what the king said, and thinking to win his favour for ever, passed over
                to England with two or three followers, and mur- [end 51] dered Becket near the high
                altar in his own cathedral: every body was shocked: his death was the triumphant
                death of a martyr: thousands of miracles were said to be afterward worked at his
                tomb, and he was worshipped as the greatest of saints, as long as popery lasted in
                the island.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Godwin refers to Becket in <hi
                        rend="italic">Political Justice</hi> (1798, I: 153-54) in a chapter
                    examining the nature of “personal virtue.” There, Godwin cites Becket as an
                    example of the difficulty of judging an action in terms of its motives: Becket’s
                    resistance to Henry II is at once a reflection of the priest’s “haughtiness” and
                    “ambition,” as well as a product of a sincere belief that his martyrdom would
                    benefit humankind as a whole. Godwin’s reference to Becket’s posthumous
                    popularity “as long as popery lasted in the island” likely refers to the fact
                    that Becket’s status as martyr and saint was dissolved by Henry VIII, who
                    instead labeled the priest a rebel and a traitor and had his shrine destroyed
                    during the Dissolution of the Monstaries in 1538.</note></p>
            <p> Henry could no otherwise make his peace with the pope, the king of France, and his
                own subjects blinded with superstition, than in the way before mentioned, by walking
                barefoot to the tomb of the holy man, and causing himself to be whipped on his naked
                back by monks of the cloister.</p>
            <p> Poor Henry, unfortunate in his wife, unfortunate in his minister, was still more
                unfortunate in his children: he was on all occasions a warm-hearted man: he married
                for ambition, not for love, and therefore queen Eleanor of all persons perhaps had
                least reason to [end 52] to be pleased with him; but I have told you how kindly and
                familiarly he behaved to his minister; and he was a most affectionate father.</p>
            <p> He loved his eldest son Henry so much, that he determined to admit him to a share of
                royalty in his own life-time: he made a fine coronation for him; and to do him the
                more honour, waited upon him at table, according to the manner of the feudal times:
                the good fathercould not help observing, as he did it,<hi rend="italic"> Never was
                    prince more royally served! I see no such great matter in it,</hi> answered the

                    of a king.</hi></p>
            <p> Prince Henry afterward joined the king of France, his father's worst enemy, against
                his parent: queen Eleanor encouraged her two next sons, Richard and Geoffrey, to
                join in the rebellion, and they led their too in- [end 53] dulgent father a weary
                life: at length prince Henry died; but the others persisted in their disobedience,
                and the poor king thought he had no consolation left, but in his youngest son John,
                a graceless varlet, but who had the art to carry himself smoothly to his father: by
                and by the king discovered that John, with all his pretences, had acted in the
                basest and most treacherous manner:<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Godwin
                    seems to reference John’s siding with his brother Richard in the squabbles over
                    who would succeed their father Henry II. John, of course, was later immortalized
                    in folklore as the principle antgonist to Robin Hood.</note> The discovery broke
                his heart, and he died.</p>
            <p> In the reign of Henry happened the conquest of Ireland, which was however rather
                nominal, than real: we gained the city of Dublin and a little province round it; but
                the greater part of the island continued in the hands of its native princes. [end

            RICHARD COEUR DE LION FOUGHT FOR THE HOLY LAND WITH THE SULTAN SALADIN.</hi></p>
            
            <p> TWO years before Richard came to the crown, the sultan Saladin took Jerusalem from
                the Christians, after they had possessed it ninety years: all Europe was astonished
                and confounded at the intelligence, and a new crusade was immediately fitted out for
                the recovery of the Holy Land: Richard, who burned with the desire of the military
                glory, was one of the commanders.</p>
            <p> Of all the real histories of war, that of the war between Richard and Saladin is the
                most heroical: Richard performed feats of personal valour that are almost
                miraculous: Saladin (no Turk, but a Saracen<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                    <hi rend="italic">No Turk, but a Saracen</hi>: The basis for Godwin’s
                    distinction between Turk and Saracen is somewhat obscure, given that both terms
                    were often used interchangeably by western Europeans to describe Muslims in
                    general. In the <hi rend="italic">Life of Chaucer</hi>, Godwin praises Saracenic learning as providing the foundations for
                    Europe’s emergence from the dark ages (I: 201-2), while
                    the reference to Saladin’s generosity, civility and manners associates the
                    “Turk” with more “negative” aspects of the Ottoman Empire. This accords with
                    both a medieval and Christian literary tradition which posed Saladin as a kind
                    of chivalric hero and used the term “Turk” broadly to describe the enemy of
                    Christian Europe. See Carole Hillenbrand, “The Evolution of the Saladin Legend
                    in the West” in <hi rend="italic"> Mélanges de l'Université Saint-Joseph</hi> 58
                    (2005): 1-13. In <hi rend="italic">St. Leon</hi>, Godwin represents Turkish
                    colonial rule in Hungary as corrupt and dictatorial, though the novel’s
                    eponymous narrator sees little distinction between the Ottomans and the equally
                    ruinous colonial aspirations of the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand I. See <hi rend="italic">St. Leon</hi>, 361-81. In this respect, “Turk” would appear to
                    be another figure for what Godwin calls “institution” in <hi rend="italic">Political Justice</hi>, though it also invokes the burgeoning discourse of
                    Romantic Orientalism that will emerge in the following decade in popular works
                    by Robert Southey, Thomas Moore, and Byron.</note>) was superior to Richard in
                generosity and civilised manners: Richard took Acre at the end of a three [end 55]
                years siege, and won a great battle against Saladin at Ascalon; but he was obliged
                to give up the war without taking Jerusalem: he made a truce with the sultan for
                three years: when he came away, he sent Saladin word that, at the expiration of the
                truce, he would not fail to give him again the meeting with more numerous forces; to
                which the sultan politely replied that, if it were his fortune to lose this portion
                of his dominions, he had rather it became the conquest of the king of England, than
                of any other prince in the world.</p>
            <p> King Richard was shipwrecked near Venice on his return to Europe: as he had offended
                most of the princes who had joined in the crusade with him by his superior glory and
                the violence of his temper, he disguised himself like a pilgrim, that he might cross
                Germany safely by land: he was found [end 56] out however and arrested by the basest
                of his rivals, Leopold, duke of Austria, who threw him into an obscure dungeon at
                Dirrenstein on the Danube: for some time no one knew what was become of him: in this
                perilous situation Blondel, a minstrel, and a fast friend of king Richard who had
                been extremely fond of his heroic songs is said to have wandered among all the
                fortresses of that part of the world, to find where his brave master was hid: as he
                approached the castle of Dirrenstein, he struck of a favourite ballad, which he and
                the king had often sung together: when he had finished the first stanza, a voice
                from within the walls, which he immediately knew for king Richard's, began the
                second: I suppose Blodel found some means to letting his master know what he
                purposed: he then went immediately and informed queen Eleanor, the [end 57] mother
                of Richard: a great ransom was raised, and the king was finally brought home again
                to his country: he did not however long survive, being killed by an arrow, as he was
                besieging the castle of one of his rebellious barons in Normandy.</p>
            <p> In the time of Richard lived the famous Robin Hood, who retired with a hundred
                followers into Sherwood Forest, where he lived upon the king's deer, and the booty
                he took from travellers: upon him fourhundred men never dared to set, though ever so
                strong: he pillaged the rich, to give to the poor; so that of all thieves he is the
                prince and the most gentle thief: volumes of old English songs have been made of his

            <p> JOHN Lackland may challenge all history to produce his equal in folly, presumption,
                and wickedness: you have heard how he behaved to his father.</p>
            <p> The true heir to the crown on the death of king Richard, was Arthur of Britanny, the
                son of Geoffrey, John's elder brother: Richard however made a will bequeathing the
                succession to John; and the barons of England admitted his claim: Arthur was twelve
                years old at the decease of Richard, and four years after fell into the hands of his
                barbarous uncle, who put him to death; according to some accounts stabbed the
                defenceless youth in a [end 59] boat in the night-time with his own hand.</p>
            <p> The king of France, seeing how foolish and wicked a prince John was, thought this a
                favourable time to take away Normandy, and unite it to his own crown, and he
                succeeded; when John heard of it, he said,<hi rend="italic">What the French conquer
                    in years, I will retake in a day, when I set about it:</hi> but John was all
                talk, and no performance.</p>
            <p> John quarrelled with the pope, and for some time swore, and blustered, as was his
                custom, and boasted what great things he would do, but afterward submitted: he
                confessed himself the subject of thepope, and delivered his crown into the hands of
                the pope's legate, who kept it five days before he returned it. </p>
            <p> Every body took advantage of John's want of character and spirit: they cared nothing

                    English constitution follows a long line of legal and historical interpretation
                    which, from the late sixteenth century on, reframed the document in liberal or
                    radical terms. Reviving the Magna Charta was instrumental in the political
                    debates surrounding the English Civil War, a period of intense interest to
                    Godwin, and was invoked by seventeenth century jurists like Sir Edward Coke as a
                    basis for establishing Parliamentary power, legal principles such as <hi
                        rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi>, and for limiting the divine right of
                    kings. In the <hi rend="italic">Life of Chaucer</hi>, Godwin refers to the legal-historical geneology descending from the
                    “memorable epoch of the Magna Charta,” which includes “chief justice Coke,” as
                    necessary “to maintain in the human mind a certain sentiment of independence and
                    integrity” (I: 363-64). Writing in the context of the return of papal authority
                    during the early years of the reign of Edward III, Godwin also understands the
                    “repeated reenactions” of the Magna Charta as essential for safeguarding “a
                    vigorous secular administration” (<hi rend="italic">Life of Chaucer</hi>, II:
                    118-19).</note> which they forced John to sign at Runny Mead, near Windsor: till
                his time, as all the Norman kings had been soldierly and active men, they governed
                as much as they could by their own will, and endeavoured to shun any such
                declaration as is contained in Magna Charta.</p>
            <p> John had no sooner signed Magna Charta, then he showed an inclination to break it;
                the barons, tired of his wickedness and tyranny, invited over Louis, the dauphin of
                France, who soon took possession of London, and all the southern part of the
                kingdom: northing but the death of John at this crisis, prevented his entire
                success.</p>
            <p> Among the other extravagances of [end 61] John, he is said to have sent a proposal
                to the Miramolin, or emperor of Morocco, offering to turn Mahometan, if the
                Miramolin would aid him against the pope, the king of France and the English
                nation.</p>
            <p> King John is the name of the most ancient of Shakespear's historical plays: it
                contains many fine scenes respecting the unfortunate Arthur, and various
                considerable events of this reign: in general the productions of this incomparable

            1216</hi></p>
            
            <p><hi rend="center">HENRY OF WINCHESTER WAS A POOR CREATURE, AND HAD A TROUBLESOME REIGN OF FIFTY-SIX
                YEARS.</hi></p>
            
            <p> THERE are four kings in the series of English monarchs, who laboured under an
                evident want to capacity; these are Henry of Winchester, Edward of Caernarvon,
                Richard of Bourdeaux, and Henry of Windsor: Henry of Winchester was the only one of
                the four, who died a natural death.</p>
            <p> Henry was only nine years old, when he came to be king: William Marshal, earl of
                Pembroke, was appointed lord protector of England during his childhood, and under
                Pembroke's able administration the French invaders were driven back to their own
                country.</p>
            <p> The most famous statesman in the reign of Henry of Winchester was Si- [end 63] mon
                Montfort: Henry reigned, comparatively with little interruption from his barons, for
                forty-two years: they at length grew tired of his insignificance and imbecility; and
                Simon Montfort being at their head, he possessed for seven years more authority in
                the realm than the king.</p>
            <p> A great change had taken place in Europe since the time of William the Conqueror;
                during his life all the people of Christendom were either soldiers, or clergy, or
                husbandmen: the whole were divided into lords and slaves: there were few artists and
                less trade: the crusades were the first cause that gradually produced a new face of
                things: they gave birth to an intercourse between distant nations, through the means
                of which men learned new wants and new accommodations: we imported learning and
                luxuries from the East: Europe kept possession of the kingdom [end 64] of Jerusalem
                for ninety years: and the towns of Italy first, and afterward of other countries,
                became rich in merchandise by means of their traffic to Jerusalem.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                        distant nations</hi>: Godwin also speaks of the

                    relevance: the late eighteenth/early nineteenth century saw increased travel to,

            <p> The citizens and merchants were neither lords nor slaves: about the same time there
                arose a middle set of men in the open country, persons who held land as freemen, and
                yet were not rich enough, to associate with the barons, and frequent high courts of
                parliament: all this gave rise to a their order of persons in the kingdom; burgesses
                were elected to represent the towns, and knights of shires to represent the inferior
                landholders: Simon Montfort was the author of the house of commons, that precious
                part of our government, in England.</p>
            <p> Two great battles were fought between Simon Montfort and Henry of Winchester, the
                first at Lewes, here [end 65] king Henry was taken prisoner, the second at Evesham,
                where Simon Montfort was killed: Henry spent the short remainder of his days in
                peace.</p>
            <p> Henry of Winchester was a great encourager of the fine arts of architecture,
                painting and sculpture: the beginning of these arts were rude, but the period of
                Henry III is considered as the dawn of taste: he rebuilt Westminster Abbey from the
                ground.</p>
            <p> From his reign we may also date the commencement of literature and science in modern
                times: Friar Bacon in particular was a wonderful man, to whom the art of making
                gunpowder, telescopes and microscopes was familiar, centuries before they were
                brought into ordinary use.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                    and English philosopher. Godwin’s praise is typical of many nineteenth-century
                    rationalists, for whom Bacon’s emphasis on induction and the experimental study
                    of nature anticipates the Enlightenment. His <hi rend="italic">Opus Majus

            1272.<lb/>
            EDWARD LONGSHANKS WAS KNOWING AND WISE, BUT HE LOVED WAR, AND CONDUCTED IT
                BARBAROUSLY.</hi></p>
            
            <p> THE two kings in the English history who possessed the greatest portion of
                understanding and genius, were William the Conqueror and Edward Longshanks.</p>
            <p> Edward, at the same time of his father's death, was engaged on a crusade to the Holy
                Land.</p>
            <p> There is an agreeable story of Edward, that while he was in the Holy Land, a
                Mahometan assassin came into his tent to murder him, that he stabbed Edward in the
                arm with a poisoned dagger, and that queen Eleanora saved her husband by sucking the
                poison out of his wound: certain it is that Edward was passion- [end 67] ately fond
                of Eleanora all the days of her life.</p>
            <p> Edward Longshanks introduced the old Roman law, commonly called the civil law, into
                England, and spread over his country a face of security, propriety and order, which
                has never since been banished from it.</p>
            <p> As he was a prince of extensive views, he aspired to reduce the whole island under
                one rule, and regarded that as the natural means of giving to the English people a
                permanent stability and independence of all the nations of the earth.</p>
            <p> The Welsh, calling themselves the Ancient Britons, had continued unsubdued ever
                since the retreat of the Romans; they had been unconquered by the Saxons and the
                Danes: the Norman and Plantagenet princes had frequently been at war with them, and
                obliged them to pay tribute, but they had still [end 68] been governed by princes
                and laws of their own: Edward Longshanks completed the conquest of Wales.</p>
            <p> From the time when the Romans flourished in Britain, the Welsh had been Christians:
                the Druidical religion and learning had irretrievably perished: but there was still
                a class of men among the Welsh called the Bards: these were such an imperfect image
                of the great masters of astronomy and history in the Druidical times, as could be
                expected to be preserved through centuries of ignorance, calamity and popish
                superstition: still they had songs, dear to their countrymen, which preserved among
                their hearers the love of Wales and of liberty.</p>
            <p> Edward, who wished England and Wales to be for ever united, did not love the Bards:
                there is a story that he invited a general assembly of them to meet him at Conway,
                and there caused [end 69] them all to be murdered: Gray, a late English poet, has
                written an ode of some merit on this subject:<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                by Edward I, the eldest son of the king of England has been called prince of Wales.</p>
            <p> An event occurred soon after, which gave Edward a favourable opportunity for
                interfering in the affairs of Scotland: the male line of the kings of that country
                had become extinct, and disputes had arisen between John Baliol and Robert Bruce,
                descendants of the female line, which of these had the best claim to the crown:
                Scotland was on the eve of a civil war on the subject; when the wisest heads in
                thegovernment of that country, advised that Edward, famed for knowledge and
                sagacity, should be called in as umpire to settle the dispute, and that all parties
                should swear to abide by his decision.</p>
            <p> Edward set out in execution of this [end 70] office with an army for the borders of
                Scotland: and, when he had got every thing into his own hand, he set up a barefaced
                and groundless pretence, that the kings of Scotland had been at all times feudal
                vassals under the kings of England, and required the candidates to swear this
                subjection, before he would decide upon their claims: Edward had every advantage
                over the country without a government or a king, and they were obliged to submit: he
                then decided in favour of Baliol, the descendant of the elder branch of the royal
                family of Scotland.</p>
            <p> It was not that he might add a feather to the English crown, that Edward asserted
                the vassalage of Scotland: he soon picked a quarrel with the new king, and asserted
                that he had not performed all the duties that were required from the feudal vassal
                to his superior: he therefore, declared the vassal state for- [end 71] feited to the
                lord paramount, and marched an army to take possession of it: in this enterprise he
                succeeded.</p>
            <p> All nations love their independence, and abhor the idea of becoming a province and
                an inferior member of some other nation: it is the name of ENGLAND, that has
                inspired our soldiers and sailors with bravery, and our poets with sublimity and
                imagination: Scotland is not less dear to a Scotchman: when a country is no longer
                its own master, it loses its peculiar name, or that name no longer excites the same
                glow in the bosoms of its natives.</p>
            <p> The officers that Edward sent to manage Scotland, governed it tyrannically: one of
                the bravest and noblest of mankind, sir William Wallace, arose at this time to
                rescue her from subjection: he underwent incredible hardships, and achieved wonders:
                but his successes were not permanent: he was at last betrayed into the hands of
                Edward, who basely caused him to suffer the death of a traitor on Tower Hill: there
                is an old poem, as long as Homer's Iliad, in the Scotish dialect, by a person known
                by the name of Blind Harry, commemorating the achievements of sir William
                    Wallace.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

            </p>
            <p> Three times Edward conquered Scotland: a third time it rebelled; and, having been
                now some years without a king, the Scots chose Robert Bruce, the grandson of the
                competitor of John Baliol, for their sovereign: Edward marched against Bruce, but
                died on the road, in the sixty-ninth year of his age.</p>
            <p> Edward, like his ancestors, the Plantagenets, was a patron of literature and the
                poets: in his reign Oxford had at one time thirty thousand students, a much greater
                number than at any subsequent period. [end 73]</p>

            <p>THE death of Edward I was a fortunate event for the Scots: they kept their ground
                and in the seventh year of the reign of Edward of Caernarvon, won a decisive battle

                    Bruce's army at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314.</note>
            </p>
            <p> Edward of Caernarvon had attached himself while a boy, to an adventurer, by name
                Gaveston, and when he came to the crown, gave the government of the kingdom into his
                hands: Gaveston was a handsome man, expert in youthful sports, riding and fencing;
                but he was [end 74] vain, conceited and overbearing: the old nobles of the kingdom
                could not endure him: they obliged the king to send him into banishment: but,
                finding that neither the king nor Gaveston minded his promise, and that, as soon as
                the barons had gone home, Gaveston was restored to as much power as ever, they at
                length struck off his head without form of trial, on a hill near Warwick.</p>
            <p> Edward of Caernarvon could not live without a favourite, and after the death of
                Gaveston attached himself to a young man of the name of Spencer: he was not of low
                rank like Gaveston: he was the son of a respectable nobleman, though not of the
                highest class: but the barons no sooner saw him fixed in power, than they hated him
                as inveterately as they did his predecessor: Spencer was finally hanged on a gibbet,
                together with his venerable father near [end 75] ninety years of age, in defiance of
                law, decorum and humanity.</p>
            <p> The wife of Edward of Caernarvon was Isabella, sister to the king of France: she had
                long despised her husband, and wished to govern him; but she was never able to gain
                his confidence: at length she forgot herself so far as to live in open adultery with
                Roger Mortimer earl of March: one crime led to another: she who had firstdespised,
                and next proved unfaithful to her husband, afterward deprived him of his crown, and
                then of his life.</p>

                three years after, he joined in a confederacy with certain noblemen, who entered
                Nottingham Castle where the queen and Mortimer lay, seized Mortimer, who was tried
                and hanged for his crimes, and sent Isabella to prison.</p>
            <p> The reign of Edward III belongs to the age of chivalry: the first idea of chivalry
                was for a knight in complete armour to sally forth on horseback in search of
                adventures, to succour distress, and punish oppression: in ages of the world, when
                every baron had a castle, and there was no king or law strong enough to prevent him

            <p> In the stories of the knights-errant, or the knights of chivalry, we continually
                read of their rescuing ladies from [end 77] dungeons and tyrants: a lawless,
                uneducated man, who was lord of a castle too often would not be at the trouble to
                court the lady he liked, but ran away with her by force, without asking her own
                consent or that of her parents and then, if she was angry, would shut her up in a
                dungeon, till she consented to whatever he pleased: the knight-errant, when he
                entered on his profession, vowed that he would devote all his powers to the service
                of God and the ladies.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

            <p> By the time of Edward III the real use of chivalry was pretty well over but it had
                in it certain features of courage, refinement and humanity, they made it continue a
                favourite: when the knights no longer rode out to encounter an oppressor (or, as we
                find it in story-books, a giant or a dragon he dressed himself in armour, mounted on
                horseback, and invited any other [end 78] [n.b., image of jousting between 78 and
                79] knights he could meet with to a friendly trial of skill: when a great many met
                together for this purpose, it was called a tournament.</p>
            <p> There were more tournaments in the reign of Edward III, than in all the rest of the
                English history put together: the king was frequently one of the combatants, and the
                queen and all her ladies, seated upon thrones and lofty benches in a circle, were
                among the spectators.</p>
            <p> As Edward was very fond of splendour and show, and a great encourager of
                tournaments, he was led naturally from this image of war, to wish for the
                    reality: like too many other kings and heads of nations, he desired to be a conqueror.</p>
            <p> A conqueror is a man who sallies forth at the head of an army, to disturb the peace
                and repose of honest, unoffending husbandmen, peasants and ar- [end 79] tisans: he
                causes the death of thousands, and reduces nations to slavery, that he may become
                famous, and have songs made in his praise.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                    aggressive war in <hi rend="italic">Political Justice</hi>, which he characterizes as part of the “very essence of
                    monarchy and aristocracy” (1798, II: 143-44). See especially 1798, II:142-82.

            </p>
            <p> Edward III found that, in right of his mother, he had a
                claim to the crown of Frances, and that it might admit of a dispute whether he was
                nearer to the inheritance, or the Frenchman whom the French nation chose to have
                reign over them: he therefore collected a great army, and set out for the conquest
                of France: if he succeeded, he thought he should be one of the most famous
                personages in history.</p>
            <p> If he had succeeded, he would have fixed the seat of his government at Paris,
                because France is a much larger and more populous country than England; and England
                would have become a poor dependency of the French throne.</p>
            <p> At first Edward made but a very small progress; after some years he got into a
                desperate situation, at a place called Cressy: his army was nearly made prisoners:
                the English warriors were very brave: they fought their way through; they defeated
                the French, and won at Cressy a memorable and astonishing victory: this however was
                not the end of the war.</p>
            <p> Edward III had a son called Edward the Black Prince, because he wore a suit of black
                armour: he was one of the most accomplished warriors that ever lived: ten years
                after the battle of Cressy, he got into a similar difficulty to that of his father
                on the former occasion, and extricated himself from it with the same success: he
                took John, king of France, prisoner: the battles of Cressy and Poitiers are two of
                the most famous victories in modern history.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                    <hi rend="italic">The battles of Cressy and Poitiers</hi>: Godwin also discusses these two battles in the <hi rend="italic">Life of

                    consequences,” such victories also taught the English “self-reverence” and are
                    therefore “not unworthy to find a place among the causes which have made us what
                    we are” (I: 402).</note>
            </p>
            <p> When the Black Prince had made [end 81] king John prisoner, he seated him at a
                splendid entertainment in his tent, and himself waited behind the king's chair: this
                was in the very manner of the institutions of the feudal system, and of chivalry:
                when he brought king John over with him to London, he mounted his royal prisoner on
                a beautiful white horse of a large size, and rode a small black palfrey beside him
                along the streets: this was a much nobler spectacle than a Roman triumph, where the
                conqueror dragged his captive king as so many melancholy victims at his
                chariot-wheels.</p>
            <p> There is a famous story of the siege of Calais by Edward III: the brave inhabitants
                held out for nearly a year: they surrendered at last from the pressure of hunger
                only: they asked for no more than their lives: Edward was determined to punish them
                for their honourable adherence to their duty: at last he said, if they would send
                six of their principal citizens to him, in their shirts, with halters about their
                necks, he would forgive the rest.</p>
            <p> This was a more cruel difficulty than before: where were six citizens to be found,
                who would go voluntarily to death, to save the rest? at last an admirable fellow,

                obtained their lives: how strange that a prince who behaved so humanely to people of

            <p> Edward III lived to sustain the loss of all his conquests: he grew old: the Black
                Prince was seized with a consuming disorder, which robbed him of all [end 83] power
                of exertion: the English generals did their best, but in vain: France recovered her
                independence and prosperity.</p>
            <p> In the reign of Edward III lived Chaucer, the first, and one of the greatest of the
                English poets: the English language in his time recovered its ascendancy: the poets
                who had hitherto been patronised by the Plantagenet princes were French: but the
                descendants of the Saxons were always much more numerous in England than the
                Normans, and the language of the multitude at length gained the superiority: it is
                Chaucer who has presented to us the first genuine model of the present language of
                England.</p>
            <p> Edward III was the builder of Windsor Castle: the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge
                also began to be founded in this reign. [end 84]</p>

                    A critique of the inequality of property relations is a central facet of
                    Godwin’s political theory. Departing from the Scottish Enlightenment view of
                    private property as an encouragement to economic prosperity and to the
                    advancement of civil society, Godwin argues that the existing system of property
                    relations generates social strife by “engrossing all its advantages to a few
                    favoured individual, and reserving ro the portion of the rest want, dependence
                    and misery” (1798, I: 16). See in particular <hi rend="italic">Political

            <p> I have told you how the commons, by means of the progress of trade and good sense,
                rose in process of time to a certain importance: still however the greater part of
                the country people were slaves: as much had been obtained, they naturally wished for
                more: first in France, and afterward in England and other countries, they rose in
                arms, and demanded those privileges which [end 85] might best conduce to their
                improvement and comfort.</p>
            <p> The occasion of the insurrection in England was a poll-tax, or a tax of so much a
                head, upon all the inhabitants of the kingdom: the collectors of the tax behaved
                very brutally: an act of indecency that they allowed themselves in to the daughter
                of a mechanic, named Wat Tyler, exasperated the father of the girl, who, with the
                hammer that was in his hand, killed the ruffian: thousands were already in a rage

                    clear connotations with respect to the French Revolution, it also calls to mind
                    Godwin’s suspicion of “majority” and the notion that “popular commotions and
                    violence” (<hi rend="italic">Political Justice</hi> 1798, I: 277) ought never to
                    serve as the primary engine of social change. See 1798, I: 253-55, 263-84.
                    Godwin repeats a similar idea several times in <hi rend="italic">PJ</hi> 1798
                    esp., IV, ii (“Of Revolutions”).</note>: the insurgents marched for London in an
                immense multitude, burned down the Temple, and the Monastery of St John [end 86] in
                Smithfield, set open the prisons, and cut off the heads of the archbishop of
                Canterbury, the lord high treasurer, and many other persons of distinction, merely
                out of envy to their rank.</p>
            <p> Richard of Bourdeaux, son of Edward the Black Prince, was at this time only fourteen
                years and a half old: it was however thought necessary that he should go out from
                the Tower where he resided, and parley with the rebels in Smithfield: what they
                demanded was their liberty: during the conference, a quarrel arose between Wat Tyler
                and a knight attendant upon the king: Walworth, mayor ofLondon, took part with the
                knight, and felled Tyler to the ground: the multitude grew furious: at this instant
                king Richard rode forth from his own people to meet the rebels: he called out to
                them to <hi rend="italic">follow him who was their king, and he would grant them
                    whatever they</hi> [end 87]<hi rend="italic"> should require:</hi> he led them
                into the open fields: while they were debating on terms with him, a considerable
                military force was collected: the multitude lost their opportunity, and in the
                insurrection was soon after suppressed, and rigorously punished.</p>
            <p> Richard, as he grew up, appeared to be one of our weak sovereigns, who could not
                live without a favourite: the name of the man he chose was Vere, earl of Oxford,
                descended from the ancient nobility: but like most favourites, he was forward,
                presumptuous and overbearing: Richard himself was a mere man of pleasure, fond of
                the pomp and magnificence attendant upon royalty, but careless of its duties: his
                expences were lavish and prodigal, and excited a general sentiment of
                discontent.</p>
            <p> Thomas of Woodstock, one of Richard's uncles, and brother to the Black [end 88]
                Prince, took advantage of his nephew's feeble character and unpopularity, drove the
                favourite into banishment, and usurped all the powers of royalty, leaving Richard
                nothing but the name.</p>
            <p> This lasted three years, when a second convulsion restored Richard to his authority,
                under the guardianship of a new set of favourites, by whose orders Thomas of
                Woodstock was smothered in his bed.</p>
            <p> Richard gained little by the murder of Thomas of Woodstock: the next year Henry of
                Bolingbroke, son of the famous John of Gaunt duke of Lancaster, another of Richard's
                uncles, raised an army against the king, took him prisoner, shut him up in Pomfret
                Castle, where he caused him to be starved to death, and placed himself on the
                throne.</p>
            <p> In the time of Richard of Bourdeaux lived John Wicliffe, a man of great [end 89]
                learning and courage, who preached against the abuses of popery<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                    <hi rend="italic">John Wicliffe…who preached against the abuses of popery</hi>:
                    John Wicliffe (c. 1331-1381) was a theologian, Oxford professor, reformer, and
                    early translator of the Bible into common English. Wicliffe’s insistence on the
                    primacy of the individual’s interpretation of scripture, his attacks on the
                    Church hierarchy, and rejection of papal authority led him to be declared a
                    heretic and his works banned in 1415. Given this background it is not difficult
                    to see why Godwin, whose politics are deeply shaped by similar
                    anti-authoritarian strains within the Puritan tradition, would make positive
                    mention of Wicliffe here. The second volume of the <hi rend="italic">Life of

            <p> THE king of France died in less than two months after his conqueror; and Henry of
                Windsor was proclaimed king of England in London, and king of France in Paris,
                before he was a year [end 95] old: he lived long enough to become a poor and
                friendless prisoner in the Tower of London.</p>
            <p> The son of the late king of France still maintained some authority in the southern
                parts of that kingdom: war was carried on for seven years between the contending
                parties, but the balance of success was in favour of the English: at the end of
                seven years their enemies appeared ruined: the last trial of strength was before the
                town of Orleans besieged by the English.</p>
            <p> When every thing now looked desperate for the French, a poor young woman,
                twenty-seven years of age, the maid-servant of a village-inn, called Joan of Arc,
                came to the prince-dauphin of France, and told him she was inspired by God to raise
                the siege of Orleans, and to place him on the throne of his ancestors: in the now
                wretched state of his affairs the prince [end 96] thought any means worth trying:
                the defeated and unhappy French believed every thing Joan of Arc told them: she put
                herself at the head of a detachment, and forced her way into the town: the English
                were as much astonished as the French, at the appearance o this strange sort of
                general: the siege was raised.</p>
            <p> Joan of Arc conducted her sovereign to the cathedral of Rheims in the northern part
                of the kingdom, where all his ancestors had celebrated their coronation, and where
                the same ceremony was now performed for him: this was the last of her exploits: she
                was soon after taken prisoner by the English, who barbarously caused her to be
                burned alive for a witch: they never however recovered the effects of her
                achievements, and were finally driven out of France.</p>
            <p> This is the first part of the history [end 97] of Henry of Windsor: during the early
                part of his reign he fought for the crown of France; during the later he was obliged
                to fight for the crown of England.</p>
            <p> John of Gaunt duke of Lancaster was the third, and Edmund of Langley duke of York
                the fourth son of Edward III: but the descendants of York intermarried with the
                Mortimers' claim to the throne of England: this was the source of the famous wars of
                York and Lancaster, frequently called the wars of Two Roses, White and Red.</p>
            <p> The mischiefs which the English had inflicted upon France, now recoiled upon
                ourselves: our king became mad with a madness exactly similar to that of the late
                king of France: his government was not less weak, and distracted with factions; and
                Richard duke of York [end 98] was appointed lord protector of England during the
                king's indisposition.</p>
            <p> Henry VI had for his queen, Margaret of Anjou, a lady of great beauty, understanding
                and accomplishments: this woman for a long time supported the party of Lancaster by
                her abilities: she had borne to king Henry an only son, a child of great promise,
                and it was to the maintaining his claim to succeed after the death of his father,
                that she directed all her exertions.</p>
            <p> Richard duke of York, lord protector of the kingdom, had a better claim to the crown
                than he who wore it: this was a critical situation: queen Margaret thought it
                dangerous to suffer him to retain his office: he seemed to aspire to nothing more,
                but he would not part with what he had got: both sides had recourse to arms: after
                his second victory over the Lancastrians, and having twice taken king Henry [end 99]
                prisoner, duke Richard caused the parliament to confirm him lord protector during
                the life of Henry, and heir to the crown after his decease.</p>
            <p> Margaret having raised new forces in the north, the battle of Wakefield was soon
                after fought: in this battle the Yorkists were defeated, and duke Richard
                killed.</p>

            <p> EDWARD, eldest son of Richard duke of York, was daring and adventurous, and in a
                short time after the death of his father, caused himself to be proclaimed king by
                the title of Edward IV.</p>
            <p> Three years after, his reign became fully established by the victory he obtained
                over queen Margaret at Hex- [end 101, n.b. no page number on this page] ham:
                Margaret, flying alone by night with her son, now ten years old, through the
                neighbouring forest after the battle, was met by a robber with a drawn sword:
                Margaret, with the sound judgment and the courage which she always displayed,
                finding she could not escape, advanced boldly toward the robber, saying,<hi rend="italic">Behold the son of your king! I commit him to your protection!
                </hi>the outlaw was struck with the magnanimity of this action, accepted the trust,
                and concealed his royal guests, till the danger was over, and a vessel procured to
                transport them to Flanders.</p>
            <p> The principal partisan of Edward IV was Neville earl of Warwick, who, from the share
                he had in raising Edward to the throne, obtained the surname of the<hi rend="italic">king-maker:</hi> when Edward had already been king nine years, he and his great
                partisan quarrelled; [end 102] and, as Warwick had before obtained Edward the crown,
                he resolved now to deprive him of it: he accordingly took his measures so well that
                Edward was obliged to fly the kingdom: according to the old historians he was for
                some time Warwick's prisoner: in six months however he appeared again at the head of
                an army: Warwick was defeated and killed in the battle of Barnet; and, Edward having
                obtained a second victory at Tewkesbury, king Henry VI, and his beloved son, now
                sixteen years of age, were murdered by his order.</p>
            <p> Never were any wars more cruel than those of the Two Roses: queen Margaret from
                resentment and passion, and Edward out of hardness of his heart, sanctioned the most
                bloody proceedings: in all the later battles no quarter was given, and the nobility
                and leaders of the defeated army who were not so fortunate as to perish in the
                field, [end 103] were instantly led to the scaffold: it seemed as if refinement,
                civilisation and science were perishing from the land, and we were hastening to
                become a nation of savages.</p>
            <p> Edward IV put to death his own brother George duke of Clarence, who had been the
                abettor of Warwick in his insurrection: there is a vulgar story that he was prompted
                to this violence by a prophecy, which said that his brother G. would deprive
                Edward'schildren of the crown: people afterward found out that this prophecy related
                to his other brother, Richard duke of Gloucester.</p>
            <p> One of the most remarkable circumstances of this reign is the introduction of
                printing into England: the first English printer was William Caxton. [end 104]

            <p> THE libertine Edward IV indulged himself so licentiously with regard to women, that
                it became a question after his death who was his wife: when he married Elizabeth
                Woodville, mother to the young princes, there was another lady, Eleanor Butler,
                still living, who said he had married her: Richard duke of Gloucester took advantage
                of this circumstance, alleged that his nephews, not born in lawful wedlock, could
                not inherit the crown, and caused himself to [end 106] be proclaimed in their room:
                this was a violent and ungenerous proceeding toward the boys who were placed under
                his protection: and, if they were set aside, the children of his brother the duke of
                Clarence, had a better right than he.</p>
            <p> The poor children thus excluded from the throne, were shut up in the Tower: and
                there king Richard is reported to have caused them to be murdered: the truth of this
                depends upon the credit due to the person called Perkin Warbeck<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                not murder both his nephews, it is not credible that he murdered either.</p>
            <p> At this time the cruelties which had been practised by the house of York were
                visited on their own heads: almost all the ancient nobility of England had been
                destroyed in the wars of the Two [end 107] Roses: the Lancastrians, who nearly in
                every family had had a father, a brother, or a son, murdered upon the scaffold,
                watched for an occasion of revenge.</p>
            <p> Henry of Richmond, who had a very remote and doubtful claim to the crown derived
                from the house of Lancaster, caballed with the partisans of that house to expel
                Richard: many even of the party of York, disgusted with Richard's usurpation,
                encouraged this enterprise: Henry sailed for England, and the king, who was a brave
                and gallant soldier, immediately gave him battle at Bosworth in Leicestershire:
                Richard was killed, and the crown was placed on the head of his competitor.</p>

                France, where he gave out that he was the younger of the two princes, he went to

                    one of the first English poets to write write in blank verse and helped develop

            <p> EDWARD VI, though he was a very good boy, did not always learn his lesson: this was
                while he was prince of Wales, and before he was nine years old: it was the custom of
                those times for the prince of Wales to have a whipping boy: that is, a boy who
                learned along with him, and was whipped whenever the prince happened to be idle: the
                boy therefore teazed the prince to learn, and said,<hi rend="italic"> Oh, pray, save

            <p> The Greek language was almost unknown in the West for several centuries: when the
                Turks took Constantinople in the year 1453, the Greeks, who had possessed it before,
                fled for refuge to different countries of Europe, and brought the Greek language,
                and the writings of Homer, Pindar, Plato, and other famous Greek writers, along with
                them: from that time Greek gradually became a fashionable study: Edward VI, and his
                sister (afterward queen Elizabeth), applied to it with great earnestness: one of
                their fellow scholars, who went beyond them both in diligence and proficiency, was

            <p> Edward VI was the founder of Christ's Hospital (commonly called the

            <p> MARY was the daughter of Henry VIII by his first wife that he quarrelled with the
                pope about: there was therefore no hope but that she would do her utmost to root out
                the Reformation in England: a few Protestants set up lady Jane Grey for queen: this
                was a very wicked and a very silly scheme: the admirable young lady was hardly
                persuaded to come into it by the importunities of her father, her mother, her
                father-in-law, and her husband: her mock reign lasted nine days, and then Bloody

            1558.<br/>
            QUEEN ELIZABETH OF ALL HER SEX HAD A GENIUS BEST FITTED TO GOVERN; BUT SHE WAS APT TO
                SWEAR, AND BOX HER MINISTERS' EARS: IN HER TIME WAS THE SPANISH ARMADA.</hi></p>
           
            <p> ELIZABETH was the daughter of Henry VIII by Anne Boleyn, the lady for whose sake
                Henry turned off Mary's mother: we may therefore say that she was born a Protestant,
                and on that account she was brought in the danger of her [end 118] life during the
                reign of her bloody sister.</p>
            <p> Queen Elizabeth is said to have had some of the wisest ministers that ever a
                sovereign was blessed with; particularly lord Burleigh and sir Francis Walsingham: I
                do not know that she boxed the ears of either of these.</p>
            <p> The question whether England should belong to the Protestants or the pope was not
                yet decided: the Catholics supported the title of Mary queen of Scots,
                great-grand-daughter of Henry VII, to the throne of England, in preference to that
                of queen Elizabeth.</p>
            <p> Mary queen of Scots was the most beautiful woman of her times: she was exceedingly
                accomplished and prepossessing in her manners: she wrote very tolerable verses: but
                she wanted prudence and judgment in her conduct, and this defect proved her ruin.
                [end 119]</p>
            <p> Mary married a very weak young nobleman, her cousin: almost as soon as they were man
                and wife, they began to have violent quarrels; and about a year and a half after, he
                was found murdered: from the circumstances of the case Mary was suspected of being
                concerned in it: she was never able to clear herself, and was obliged to fly from
                Scotland: she took refuge in England, and Elizabeth threw her into prison.</p>
            <p> As long as Mary was alive, the Catholics of England would never be quiet: they
                formed many conspiracies: they entered into secret correspondences with Mary: at
                last, after eighteen years' imprisonment, this unfortunate queen had her head cut
                off at Fotheringay Castle.</p>
            <p> The year after her death Philip king of Spain fitted out an immense fleet for the
                conquest of England: it was [end 120] called the<hi rend="italic">Invincible
                    Armada:</hi> several people were so terrified, when they heard that it had
                sailed, or that it was seen off our coast, that they died of the fright: queen
                Elizabeth put herself on horseback at the head of her army to repel the invaders:
                the English captains and seamen, sir Francis Drake, sir Walter Raleigh, and others,
                baffled all their attempts to land: at length they were overtaken by a violent
                storm, and after having lost half their numbers, the rest were glad to escape safe
                to the place from which they came.</p>
            <p> Queen Elizabeth, skilful in government, and of a masculine temper, would never
                consent to take a husband: she said that, when she died, it should be inscribed upon
                her tomb-stone,<hi rend="italic">Here lies Elizabeth, who lived and died a maiden
                    queen:</hi> she however had favourites, particularly two, Robert Dudley earl of
                Leicester, and Robert Devereux earl of [end 121] Essex: with these she coquetted,
                and carried on a Platonic correspondence; and thus she endeavoured to solace herself
                for the sacrifice she made to her ambition, in having neither husband nor child.</p>
            <p> The court of queen Elizabeth was exceedingly refined, and the Platonic and romantic
                ideas she cultivated made it still more so: the brightest ornament of this court was
                sir Philip Sidney: he was the most generous and benevolent of mankind: no error, no
                blemish is to be discovered in his behaviour: he was as learned in the closet, as he
                was graceful and elegant in the drawing-room: he died in battle at the age of
                thirty-two years, leaving behind him an agreeable and singular romance, entitled
                Arcadia.</p>
            <p> One of the friends of sir Philip Sidney was Edmund Spenser: he possessed, perhaps
                beyond any poet that ever [end 122] lived, the power of representing in words the
                impressions received by the sense of sight: his great work is the Fairy Queen, the
                hero of which is king Arthur.</p>
            <p> Of all the vehicles through which writers of imagination have conveyed their
                conceptions to others, perhaps the most striking is the theatre: among the Greeks
                were many eminent dramatic writers, Sophocles, Euripides, and Menander: among the
                Romans Terrence, and Seneca, and Ovid: in the dark ages there were few public
                amusements: the minstrels went from house to house, playing on the harp, singing
                ballads of humour or heroic achievements, showing juggler's tricks, amusing their
                hearers with raillery and ribaldry, and performing a rude sort of plays: the monks
                of these uncultivated time envied the minstrels their powers [end 123] of pleasing:
                they invented godly plays, called Mysteries, and Moralities, to rival the profane
                plays of the vagabonds: the Mysteries were sometimes a representation of God making
                the world, and sometimes of the sufferings and death of Christ.</p>
            <p> After the Reformation came the drama such as we now have it: in the reign of Edward
                VI was written a laughable comedy, called Gammer Gurton's Needle:<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                    necessary process of self-reflection and revision of ideas that grounds Godwin’s
                    republican vision of society. See <hi rend="italic">Political Justice</hi> 1798,

                and, as the king found that this lad was extremely ignorant, he amused his royal
                leisure with teaching him the Latin Grammar: some time after, Carr was guilty of the
                murder of sir Thomas Overbury; so king James was obliged to turn him off.</p>
            <p> His next favourite was Villiers, afterward created created duke of Buckingham: he
                was handsome, accomplished, and not without abilities; but, like all other
                favourites, he was presumptuous, arrogant, and offensive in his demeanour: he soon
                acquired the hatred of the nation, and his master lost much of the good will of his
                subjects on his account.</p>
            <p> The greatest disgrace of the reign of James the First was the death of sir Walter
                [end 129] Raleigh: he was one of the remaining ornaments of the court of queen
                Elizabeth, a great scholar, a great statesman, an accomplished gentleman: we have
                still remaining of his the History of the World, and several sweet pieces of poetry:
                in the beginning of James's reign, he was tried and convicted on an obscure charge
                of treason: after he had remained several years a prisoner in the Tower, James took
                him out, employed him, and gave him a fleet with which he sailed to South America:
                this was virtually setting aside the sentence of death which had been pronounced
                upon him: but the Spaniards pretended that the whole of South America was theirs,
                and threatened to go to war if sir Walter Raleigh was not exemplarily punished for
                the infractions he had committed there; and the effeminate and cowardly James, to
                soothe the king of Spain, caused this great man's head to [end 130] be cut off,
                under pretence of the sentence which had been passed eighteen years before.</p>
            <p> In the latter end of Elizabeth's reign the power of the native Irish was first
                completely subdued under the English arms: in the reign of James measures, severe,
                but perhaps necessary, were taken to perpetuate the new establishment.</p>
            <p> In the reign of king James Shakespear wrote some of his best plays, particularly
                Macbeth: another writer of plays of the highest degree of excellence was Ben Jonson:
                with these two writers we may class without much disparagement the names of Beaumont
                and Fletcher<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Beaumont and Fletcher are

            <p> The English parliaments were now resolved to place the liberties of their country on

                of the highest importance: they determined to assume the same control over the
                prerogatives of the crown which the barons had exercised in former times: James the
                First and Charles the First were by no means inclined to submit to this: continual
                quarrels had arisen between them and their parliaments; and, a few months after the
                death of the duke of Buckingham, Charles resolved to call no more parliaments, and
                to try to rule without them: if he had succeeded, the government of England would

                    “causes to be judged […] to a single centre […] placed at the greatest distance
                    possible” from public discourse (1798, II: 33). On Godwin’s views of the

                governments in the world.</p>
            <p> The great power of parliament consists of this, that they only have a right to raise
                taxes on the people: though some irregularity had prevailed upon the subject, this
                had been admitted for [end 133] centuries to be a fundamental law of the English
                constitution.</p>
            <p> Charles the First governed for eleven years without a parliament: consequently he
                raised taxes on the people by his royal authority: in the midst of this period of
                despotism, a true Englishcountry-gentleman, John Hambden [<hi rend="italic"

                    the leading Parliamentarians in opposition to Charles I. He was one of the Five
                    Members of parliament whom Charles attempted to arrest on 4 January 1642, an act
                    that sparked the English Civil War.</note> refused to pay one of these irregular
                taxes, and brought the question to a public trial: the venal judges of that period
                decided against him: he lost his cause; but he gained the approbation and love of
                the whole people of England. </p>
            <p> How long this assumed authority of Charles would have gone on is uncertain: but he
                quarrelled with the people of his native country, Scotland; they determined to be
                without bishops: he determined they should not: this quarrel produced a war; and war
                could not be maintained without a fresh sup [end 134] ply of money: so king Charles
                once more summoned a parliament.</p>
            <p> The parliament of 1640 opened with great solemnity: the whole nation looked to them
                as the last hope of their country: they began with calling to account the ministers
                by whose advice king Charles had acted for eleven years: particularly they fixed
                upon Thomas Wentworth, a man of great abilities, formerly one of the most strenuous
                friends of freedom, but who had been bought off by the court, and created earl of
                Strafford: he was impeached by the house of commons, tried by the house of lords,

            <p> It is difficult for the wisest man, or the most venerable assembly, when they have
                got all power in their hands, to know where to stop: both parties, the king and the
                parliament, behaved ill: the parliament though they never [end 135] could not do
                enough to secure their late asserted liberties: the king hated the parliament,
                particularly for the death of the earl of Strafford: he had not the fortitude to
                convince them, that he would frankly and cheerfully yield so much of his power that
                he might preserve the rest: they went to war. </p>
            <p> Charles the First was capable of acting judiciously, when he followed his own
                understanding; but he was too apt to take advice,and often adopted the worst advice
                that could be got: this was the immediate occasion of the war: on the 5th of January
                1642 he went suddenly to the house of commons, got into the speaker's chair, and
                demanded that they should surrender their five ablest members, with John Hambden
                    [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] at their head, into this hands: a senseless thing
                for him to ask; an impossible thing for them to grant. [end 136]</p>
            <p> The English have always mixed a great deal of humour and smart jesting at each other
                with their quarrels: the parliament-party, who stood up for their liberties, had
                very grave faces, said long prayers, and wore short hair: their adversaries
                nicknamed them<hi rend="italic">Roundheads: </hi>the king's party set up for jolly,
                spirited gentlemen: they called themselves the <hi rend="italic">Cavaliers</hi>. </p>
            <p> The war lasted three years, and the king was conquered: then perhaps Charles might
                have been restored, and every thing placed on a right footing: but a new and
                extraordinary personage had arisen during the war, and had been a main instrument of
                bringing it to a successful conclusion: his name was Oliver Cromwel, the son of a
                brewer at Huntingdon: Oliver Cromwel resolved that king Charles should never again
                sit upon the throne: he proceeded so artificially that he baffled [end 137] every
                attempt for that purpose: he at length contrived that the king should be brought to
                trial before a high court of justice, for having made war upon the nation: Charles
                the First was condemned, and beheaded at Whitehall, January 30, 1649.</p>
            <p> The reign of king Charles the First is the most interesting period in the history of

                    Godwin’s Dissenting background inclined him to look upon the Commonwealth as a
                    seminal event in the advancement of English liberty. Accordingly, Godwin
                    approaches the Commonwealth as an early, though failed, experiment with the kind

                natives however, who were Catholics (for no part of the light of the Reformation had

                after this event, Irish affairs continued for some years in the most dismal state of
                anarchy.</p>
            <p> In the year of king Charles's death Cromwel [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] was made
                lord lieutenant of Ireland, and in a short time reduced that turbulent people to
                subjection: the year after, he was appointed lord general and commander in chief of
                all the English forces, and defeated the party that wanted to set Charles II on the
                throne, in the battle of Dunbar, and the battle of Worcester: Charles II saved his
                life by hiding for a whole day in the branches of an oak: Cromwel's [<hi
                    rend="italic">sic</hi>] [end 139] last title was lord protector of England: he
                wanted to have been king.</p>
            <p> Sine the reign of queen Elizabeth, England had had very little influence among the
                nations of Europe: Cromwel [sic] raised his country to the highest importance: he
                went to war with the Dutch, then the greatest naval power in Europe, and gave the
                command of his fleet to admiral Blake, who by his meritorious exertions soon put an
                end to the vaunts of the Dutch admiral Van Tromp, that had fastened a broom to his
                main-mast, and boasted he would sweep the English vessels from the face of the
                sea.</p>
            <p> Comwel [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] was courted equally by the kings of France and
                Spain, who wished for his alliance: he decided for France: he remembered the Spanish
                Armada, and knew that the people of that country were the most bigoted Catholics in
                Europe: admiral Blake was not less [end 140] successful against the Spaniards, than
                he had before been against the Dutch: in the reign of Cromwel the island of Jamaica
                and the harbour of Dunkirk were added to the English dominions.</p>
            <p> Cromwel [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] had for his Latin secretary, John Milton,

                    <hi rend="italic">Which was the greater man, Cromwel…or Milton?</hi>: The
                    question posed seems highly rhetorical, given Godwin’s well known admiration of
                    Milton and his somewhat more ambivalent attitude towards Cromwell both here and
                    in the <hi rend="italic">History of the Commonwealth</hi>. In the latter text,
                    Godwin sees Cromwell’s shift away from the republicanism of the Commonwealth to
                    the Protectorate as “apostasy” (III: 598-99). Equally rhetorical is Godwin’s
                    hedging with respect to Milton’s <hi rend="italic">Defensio Pro Populo Anglicano
                    </hi>(1651), which he praises highly in the <hi rend="italic">Lives of Edward

                        rend="italic">History of the Commonwealth</hi> (III: 241-45), which defends
                    Milton’s argument but situates it as part of the “atrocious” vitriol of
                    seventeenth-century political discourse. In both texts, Godwin emphasizes the
                    importance of the <hi rend="italic">Defensio</hi>’s popularity in England and
                    abroad and spends little time examining those persons whom, as he indicates
                    here, challenged the soundness of Milton’s arguments.</note> [end 141]</p>

            <p> AS long as Cromwel [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] lived, Charles II remained in exile,
                one misfortune followed from this; Charles II and his brother, James duke of York,
                became Catholics: Charles II, who had seldom serious thoughts about any thing, was
                contented to conceal his desertion of the religion in which he had been brought up;
                but the duke of York would make no secret of the matter.</p>
            <p> After the death of Cromwel [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], many experiments were made
                with the English government: Richard Cromwel [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], his son,

                majority of the [end 142] nation, the king was sent for home again.</p>
            <p> In the romance of Charlemagne, two of the principal knights are Rowland and Oliver:

            <p> Charles the Second was a depraved and licentious character: he kept a great many
                mistresses, actresses, opera-dancers and others, and had a number of children by
                them, but none by his wife.</p>
            <p> The people of England remembered how ill they had been governed by a Catholic
                    sovereign,<hi rend="italic">Bloody queen Mary</hi>; and a great party among them
                were anxious to shut out the duke of York from the succession to the crown, and to
                place it on the head of one of his daughters, [end 143] Mary and Anne: Charles II,
                who was seldom serious about any thing, made a conscience of this, and determined
                rather to lose the crown himself, than that his brother should not succeed him. </p>
            <p> At this time happened one of the most wicked things we read of in history: Titus

                    anthi-Catholic clergyman, Oates fabricated evidence of a (sham) Roman Catholic
                    plot to assassinate Charles II and install James, his Roman Catholic brother, in
                    his place. Oates was granted judiciary power by Parliament to root out so-called
                    plotters, leading to the execution of 35 people. His influence began to wane
                    after 1681. After James II’s ascension to the throne, he was convicted of
                    perjury and jailed. For further information see Oates’s <hi rend="italic">The

            <p> All king Charles's measures were bad, and his debauched way of living was very

                (lord-chief-justice Jefferies) to sentence, away the lives of lord Russel and

                    plot to capture the King’s guards.) According to Lois G. Schwoerer, Russell’s
                    trial was fair according to the treason laws in place in 1683; nonetheless, she
                    contends that Russell was recast as a martyr after death through the efforts of
                    his widow, friends, admirerers (51), and (according to Zook) his own final

            <p> The greatest literary genius of the reign of Charles II is sir Isaac Newton: he made
                many discoveries in mathematics and the knowledge of nature: he first
                demonstratively taught the true system of the universe; and his doctrines respecting

            <p> The favourite poet of the reign of Charles II is Dryden: he is not so original as
                Shakespear, nor so sublime as Milton: he does not possess the imagination of
                Spenser, nor the acute observation of life displayed by Chaucer: but he has much

            <p><hi rend="center">JAMES THE SECOND, LIKE HIS GRANDFATHER JAMES THE FIRST, WAS PUT TO A WRONG TRADE; HE
                WAS MORE LIKE A MONK, THAN A KING; HE WANTED TO MAKE US ROMAN CATHOLICS, BUT WE WERE
                A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS TOO OLD FOR IT.</hi></p>
            
            <p> THE whole of the short reign of James II was devoted to one purpose, the
                re-establishment of the Roman Ca- [end 146] tholic religion in England: and he set
                about it with so much passion and so little prudence, that even the pope disapproved
                of his proceedings.</p>
            <p> Charles II had a favourite son by one of his mistresses, the duke of Monmouth: this
                young man had been encouraged by some of the advocates of the bill of exclusion in
                the last reign, to hope that he might one day be king: four or five months after the
                accession of James II, he landed from Holland in the West of England, with a
                fewfollowers: many of the more zealous Protestants in that part of the kingdom
                joined him: but he was defeated at the battle of Sedgemoor; and, being discovered in
                a ditch, with a few pease in his pocket for food, was conducted to London, and
                beheaded on Tower Hill: the savage and inhuman Jefferies was sent down to try the
                rebels: the brutality of his proceedings was long remem- [end 147] bered, and this
                transaction is commonly known by the name of the <hi rend="italic">Bloody Western
                    Assizes</hi>.</p>
            <p> James II resolved that his ministers, and the persons in principal employment about
                him, should be Catholics: there was a law requiring that they should be Protestants:
                but James undertook of his own authority to dispense with this law: this he called
                    his<hi rend="italic">Dispensing Power</hi>.</p>
            <p> There were several laws of England hostile to the Roman Catholics, forbidding them
                the open exercise of their religion, and subjecting them to other severities: James
                published of his own will and pleasure a<hi rend="italic">Declaration of
                    Indulgence</hi> suspending the operation of these laws, and ordered this
                Declaration to be read in all churches.</p>
            <p> The Protestant clergy of England saw that it was necessary for them to make a stand
                against the rashness of the king: they determined not to read [end 148] the
                Declaration: seven of the bishops presented a petition to James against it: the
                king, to the astonishment of all mankind, sent the bishops to the Tower for writing
                this petition: they were tried for it as a crime: and never was a more universal joy
                felt, than when an English jury pronounced a verdict of<hi rend="italic">Not
                    Guilty</hi> in their favour, and set them at liberty.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Godwin may be recalling or alluding to the widespread

            </p>
            <p> Another circumstance happened nearly at the same time, which in its consequences
                deprived James of the throne: this was the birth of his only son, June 10, 1688:
                previously to this, the next heir to the crown was Mary, the king's eldest daughter,
                a zealous Protestant: and, as James was now past middle age, his subjects had no
                doubt that Mary, after his death, would speedily undo all that the king could do:
                the birth of this son put an end to their hopes. [end 149] Mary was married to
                William prince of Orange, chief magistrate of the republic of Holland: he was a
                person of great ambition, sagacity and fortitude: it was well known that, if Mary
                succeeded to the crown of England, she would desire that the functions of government
                should be committed to her husband: to this prince therefore the Protestants looked
                for succour, and he resolved to gratify them: he sailed with a considerable fleet
                and army, to redress the injuries of the people of England, and oblige the king to
                call a free parliament: he landed at Torbay on the fourth of November, five months
                after the birth of theking's son: James II was deserted by almost every body; and,
                terrified at the recollection of his father's fate, fled secretly from his palace in
                the following month, and took refuge in France.</p>
            <p> The free parliament which had been [end 150] proposed, soon after met, and came to a
                decision that James,<hi rend="italic">having violated the fundamental laws of
                    England, and withdrawn himself out of the kingdom, had abdicated the government,
                    and that the throne was vacant</hi> (this question was carried in the house of
                lords by a majority of two voices only): they next resolved upon an address to the
                prince and princess of Orange, inviting them to assume the crown: and they annexed
                to this settlement of the crown, a Bill of Rights, determining in favour of freedom
                all the questions which, of late years, had been at issue between the king and the
                people: this event is called the Revolution.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                    limitation of the king’s powers, thus establishing a constitutional rather than
                    absolute monarchy. The Crown was now required to seek Parliament’s permission
                    before raising taxes and maintaining a standing army during peacetime. The
                    Revolution also effectively ended any possibility of a Catholic ascending to the
                    throne.</note></p>
            <p> The Revolution constitutes the final settlement of the government of England:
                England had been free under the Saxons, the Normans, and the Plantagenets; but the
                freedom then enjoyed was not exactly the sort of freedom re- [end 151] quired in our
                present state of civilisation: all ideas of regular government had been suspended by
                the wards of York and Lancaster: the Tudors had reigned in many respects
                arbitrarily: the whole period between power and liberty: and this contention was not

            <p> THE discovery of America conduced more to the profit of the Spaniards than of any

            <p> Spain had once been under the dominion of the Saracens or Moors, who were
                Mahometans: the Christians afterward got the better: but the Moors of Spain were

                Spain has been thinly peopled, and has lost its industry, its ingenuity, and its
                strength.</p>
            <p> As Spain declined, France became the most powerful government in Europe: when

                him to great distress, and embittered the last days of that ostentatious monarch:
                the renown of the duke of Marlborough was so great in France, that, for a long time
                after, it is said that French nurses still their crying children, by telling them

            </p>
            <p> The duke of Marlborough was at first a great favourite with the English nation: they
                built for him the palace of Blenheim in honour of his battle of that name: at last
                people grew tired of the war: the duke of Marlborough never knew when to have done:
                Louis was humbled, but Marlborough would not make peace: a different party came into
                possession of the great offices of government, and made peace for him.</p>
            <p> An accident at court contributed to [end 157] this change: great quarrels arose
                between queen Anne's favourites, the duchess ofMarlborough and Mrs. Masham: queen
                Anne at length grew weary of the duchess's tyranny: one historian says, that the
                duchess of Marlborough spitefully spilled some watter on Mrs. Masham's best
                petticoat; Mrs. Masham determined to have her revenge by rooting the duchess out of
                queen Anne's good-will; and this decided the matter: it is a singular circumstance,
                that the duke and duchess of Marlborough are said to have been the handsomest man
                and woman at that time in England. </p>
            <p> Another affair happened which conduced no less than the spoiling Mrs. Masham's
                petticoat, to check the duke of Marlborough in his career: it was the trial of
                doctor Sacheverel: the story is this.</p>
            <p> In the reign of queen Elizabeth two [end 158] parties first rose in this country,
                one for the sovereign, the other for the people: they were then called<hi

                persons who wished to have bishops in England, and persons who thought religion
                would prosper better without them: these parties took opposite sides in the wars of
                Charles I. </p>
            <p> In the reign of Charles II they got new names: their objects were no longer the
                same: they thought less about religion, and more about politics: the king's party
                    taught<hi rend="italic">passive obedience</hi>, or in other words, that whatever
                the king thought proper to do, the people should submit: the people's party taught
                that the king was only one member of our free government, and that, as the king had

                    Edinburgh in 1648 to oppose Charles I.” “Tory” also derives from the seventeenth
                    century and is related to the Irish word for “outlaw,” <hi rend="italic"
                        >toraidhe</hi>. The term initially referred to those Irish peasants who
                    turned to robbery after being displaced by English settlers, but was
                    subsequently used to disparage supporters of James II. Though Godwin’s politics
                    are generally more Whig than Tory, his remark concerning the equally “barbarous”
                    origins of these terms gestures towards his more fundamental skepticism towards
                    party (op)positions as forms of “institution.”</note> [end 159]</p>
            <p> If the doctrines of the tories were true, the Revolution was an act of treason, and
                king William a usurper: the duke of Marlborough was a whig, or at least his best
                friends were of that party: queen Anne was in her heart a tory: the tories however

                    Plot. As Godwin notes here, Sacheverell’s impeachment by the House of Commons
                    and subsequent light sentence contributed to the Whigs’ defeat by the Tories in
                    the 1710 election.</note></p>
            <p> King William, by whose means James II was deprived of the crown, had been
                exceedingly desirous to fix the succession to the throne so as to prevent the object
                which had been effected at the Revolution from being ever undone again: he and his
                consort had no children: queen Anne had one son, the duke of Gloucester, who died at
                twelve years of age: at king William's instigation therefore an act of parliament
                was made, calling to the throne, after William and Mary and Anne, the family of
                Hanover, the nearest in the line of inheritance who were adherents to the Protestant
                religion.</p>
            <p> Queen Anne was naturally desirous to bequeath her crown to her brother, the son of
                James II: the tories professed to be friends to the succession of the Hanover
                family; but their doc- [end 161] trines so clearly pointed the other way, that
                people doubted their sincerity: queen Anne died in the fiftieth year of her age: her
                ministers were tories; the whole nation was in alarm, lest they should be once more
                doomed to make experiment of a Roman Catholic king, who, out of respect to his
                father, would be inclined to treat every thing that had been done since his exile as
                a usurpation: if any plans of that sort had been seriously formed, they were
                defeated by the quarrels of the ministers, and the sudden decease of queen Anne: she
                died on the first of August 1714, and George, elector of Hanover, was the same day
                proclaimed king.</p>

                    credits Swift with having convinced him that “monarchy was a species of

            <p> IN the beginning of this reign John Wilkes, a popular, but unprincipled demagogue,
                excited great discontents, in certain affairs in which he supported the privileges
                of the people against the incroachments of ministers.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                    <hi rend="italic">John Wilkes</hi> (1727-1797) was a popular British politician
                    who served on and off as a member of Parliament throughout his career and
                    founded the political journal <hi rend="italic">The North Briton</hi>. He was
                    brought up on charges of seditious libel for an article attacking the King, for
                    which he eventually served two years imprisonment. Fiery and polemnic, Wilkes
                    notably advocated for parliamentary reforms, rights for Dissenters and
                    Catholics, and American independence. For further information see John Oliphant,

            <p> While the Spaniards enriched themselves with the spoils of South America, the
                English planted industrious colonies on the shores of North America: it was for the
                defence of these colonies that we began the war that lord Chatham conducted: when
                the colo- [end 168] nies were grown to a certain degree of strength, the English
                parliament thought proper to impose taxes upon them: the colonies conceived they had
                as good a right as the English to pay no taxes but what they imposed upon
                themselves: on this question began the war between Great Britain and America.</p>
            <p> The colonies declared themselves Independent States: the war lasted eight years:
                they were happy in having a noble leader to command their armies, George Washington:
                after some years, France and Spain, envying our prosperity, united their forces to
                support theAmericans against us: in the end of the war their independence was
                established. </p>
            <p> While we lost an empire in the West, we gained one in the East Indies: Which was
                most worth having? The colonies of America were too large [end 169] and too distant
                for us to hope to retain them long in subjection: yet they had English feelings and
                spoke the English language: the inhabitants of our East-India dominions, (much
                larger than these) are Hindoos or Moors, speaking the Hindoo, the Arabic or the
                Persian, and can be kept in subjection only by the sword.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                    Godwin’s antipathy to British colonialism is evident throughout his career,
                    beginning as early as 1784 when he was commissioned to write three chapters for
                    the “British and Foreign History” section of <hi rend="italic">The New Annual
                        Register for 1783</hi>, and as a contributing editor under the pseudonym
                    “Mucius” for the <hi rend="italic">Political Herald, and Review </hi>in 1785-86.
                    In both, Godwin criticizes colonial policy in India while praising America as
                    the “first enlightened people who have formed for themselves and independent
                    government in the Western hemisphere” (<hi rend="italic">The New Annual Register
                        for 1783</hi>, 187). After the impeachment of Warren Hastings in 1787,
                    Godwin even made plans to write, but never completed, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Memoirs of the Administration of the Government of Madras</hi>, which were
                    to examine the “cruelty, tyranny, usurpation, and avarice” of those involved in
                    the Indian affairs (<hi rend="italic">Uncollected Writings</hi> 61). See also
                        <hi rend="italic">Political Justice</hi> 1798, II: 164-66. </note></p>
            <p> In 1789 began the French revolution: the French, who (as their name implies) were
                once as free as any nation in Europe, had for more than a century been reduced to
                complete subjection: as they were a proud nation, and more vain than proud, they
                could not bear to hear of the liberties of their neighbors, and feel that they
                themselves were slaves: the successful struggle of the Americans for independence
                particularly inflamed them.</p>
            <p> Unhappily the French nation are of a violent and fiery temper[.] they went [end 170]
                about their undertaking too eagerly: they stopped at nothing: yet as they are a
                refined and polished people, their neighbours at first sympathised in their efforts,
                and wished for a revolution too: the king of Prussia, the king of Spain, the emperor
                of Germany, and other princes, did not like this: they went to war with France, that
                they might check so dangerous a spirit in its source.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                    <hi rend="italic">They went to war with France, that they might check so
                        dangerous a spirit in its source</hi>: The War of the First Coalition
                    (1792-97) represented the first attempt by European monarchies to crush the
                    French Revolution through a series of invasions. It was comprised of the
                    monarchies of Austria, Sardinia, Naples, Prussia, Spain, and Great Britain.
                    Godwin’s phrasing implies that the Prussian, Spanish, and German monarchs were
                    the aggressors in declaring war on France, though historically the beginning of
                    the conflict is difficult to pin down: it was France who first declared war on
                    Prussia in 1792, though the declaration itself was a response to the Declaration
                    of Pillnitz (1791) in which Frederick II of Prussia and the Habsburg Holy Roman
                    Emperor Leopold II declared their opposition to the Revolution, which led to the
                    Prussians initial invasion of France. Godwin’s equivocations concerning the
                    French reflects his lingering, if pragmatically subdued, belief in the core
                    principles of the Revolution. In the first edition of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Political Justice</hi>, Godwin more closely aligns his argument for “a
                    government of the simplest construction” with “the ideas
                    of the French Revolution” (1793, 4), though he remains consistent throughout the
                    three editions in criticizing insurrectionary violence. By the third edition,
                    Godwin’s support for the Revolution is more nuanced, and led him to revise and
                    expand his earlier chapter “Of Revolutions” (Book 4, Chapter 2). For a list of

            <p> Louis XVI then king of France, was a harmless, and well-meaning sovereign: yet he
                could not feel himself quite easy: his queen, sister to the emperor of Germany, who
                was very unpopular, felt still more alarmed: they tried to escape out of France, and
                join their friends on the frontiers: they were brought back: and Louis was some time
                after tried, as Charles I. had been, on an accusation of stirring up war against his
                country: he was sentenced, and experienced the same unhappy fate. [end 171]</p>
            <p> When the French had cut off their king's head, England joined the confederacy
                against them, and the flames of war spread from one end of Europe to the other:
                France was finally victorious.</p>
            <p> The English however made some figure in this war: our seamen had long been the best
                in the world: yet, by some mismanagement, this had not been seen in the American
                war, till the last year of that contest, when lord Rodney introduced a more daring
                method of attacking the enemy, and thus gave our superiority its full effect: the
                naval commanders in the war of the French revolution followed lord Rodney's steps,
                and our fleets were every where victorious: the war was concluded by the treaty of
                Amiens in 1802.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                    particular, by exploiting weaknesses, he was able to break up the French line
                    during the 1782 battle of the Saints in the Carribean thereby confirming
                    Britain’s ascendency in the Carribean and strengthening their negotiating power

                        Cromwel</hi>: Napoleon crowned himself Emperor in 1804, an event Godwin
                    noted in his diary on 18 May. Though the comparison of Napoleon to the
                    “apostate” Cromwel [sic] may not be as complementary as his remark initially
                    suggests, Godwin remained sympathetic towards both figures for much of his
                    career. Godwin’s sympathies toward Napoleon became more pronounced between 1813
                    and 1818, due in part to his increased contact with intermittently
                    pro-Napoleonic radicals such as Robert Owen (1771-1858) and John Thelwall
                    (1764-1834). According to Henry Crabb Robinson, Godwin, Thelwall, and Hazlitt
                    were among the most disappointed with Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo (<hi

                    quickly withdrawn after Waterloo, Godwin criticized the European Alliance’s
                    decision at the Congress of Vienna to depose Napoleon after his return from
                    exile as an unjustifiable interference in the internal affairs of another

                this man in 1804 declared himself emperor of France, and in 1805 king of Italy: the
                French had in the war of their revolution conquered the Netherlands, Holland,
                Switzerland, and many other countries: a second war was now begun against them, to
                check their overgrown power, as the first had been begun to check their
                revolutionary principles: Bonaparte finished this war victoriously in three months,
                and on the 27th of December 1805 dictated terms of peace to the emperor of Germany,
                in his capital of Vienna: William Pitt, son of the earl of Chatham, who conducted

            <p>RELIGIONS.<lb/>
            I. THE Druidical, or the religion of the Ancient Britons. [p. 12, 13, 69.]<lb/>
            II. The Greek and Roman, the religion of Homer and Virgil. [p. 15.]<lb/>
            III. The Scandinavian, or the religion of the Saxons and Danes: a book was written,
                which is the Bible of this religion, about the time [end 175, n.b. number not
                included on page] of William the Conqueror, called the Edda. [p. 19, 25.]<lb/>
            IV. The Christian [p. 11, 16]: this religion became corrupted in the dark ages, when
                the popes employed it as their instrument, for imposing the most absurd doctrines
                (such as transubstantiation, or the actual change of the bread and wine in the
                sacrament, into the flesh and blood of Christ), and for exercising the greatest
                tyranny: the popes styled their adherents the Roman Catholic church. [p. 20, 24, 36,
                46, 49, 60, 90, 112, 116.] The French, the Spaniards, the Italians, with the half of
                Germany and Poland, are Catholics.<lb/>
            V. The Protestant: an attempt to purify the Christian religion from the corruptions
                of the church of Rome: begun by Martin Luther [end 176] and John Calvin. [p. 112,
                116.] England, Holland, Sweden, Denmark, and the other half of Germany and Poland,
                are Protestant.<lb/>
            Russia, and the Christians of the Turkish empire, are of a third sect of Christians,
                called the Greek church.<lb/>
            VI. The Episcopalians; so called form the Latin word, <hi rend="italic">episcopus</hi>, a bishop: that division of Protestants, who maintain that the
                government of the Christian church ought to be by bishops: this party in the reign
                of Charles I. assumed the name of the <hi rend="italic">Cavaliers</hi>. [p. 134,
                137, 159.] <lb/>
            VII. The Puritans: that division of Protestants, who opposed the government by
                bishops, and demanded a republican equality in matters of religion. This party [end
                177] in the reign of Charles I. was familiarly nicknamed the <hi rend="italic">Roundheads</hi>. [p. 137, 159.]<lb/>
            Whig and Tory are scarcely religious parties, but succeeded in state affairs to the
                two parties last mentioned: when spoken of in relation to their religious
                prepossessions, they are usually called <hi rend="italic">High Church</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Low Church</hi>. [p. 159, 161.]<lb/>
            VIII. The Mahometan: Mahomet, who began to propagate this religion in the year of our
                Lord 622, was a native of Arabia: the Turks, the Saracens, the Persians, the Moors,
                and many other nations are followers of Mahomet: their Bible is a book, called the
                Alcoran, written by Mahomet. [p. 36, 62, 154.] [end 178]</p>

                destroyed by the Greeks, 1184 years before Christ.<lb/>
            [p.48.] [end 179]<lb/>
            The Greeks: this race of men inhabited the country now called Turkey in Europe: they
                excelled all nations in subtlety and invention: the principal city of Greece was
                Athens. [p. 12, 28, 115, 123.]<lb/>
            The Romans: this race of men was at one time the most temperate, public-spirited and
                virtuous, and at another the most licentious and debauched of mankind: they studied
                the learning of the Greeks: the Greeks and Romans are the most refined nations of
                antiquity. [p. 12, 13, 28, 82, 123.]<lb/>

            The Saxons: this race of men came from the shores of the Baltic in the fifth century:
                they are supposed to be of the same origin as the Germans, and to be descended from
                the Goths. [p. 16, 24.]<lb/>

            The same may be affirmed of the Normans: also of the Franks, who invaded France at

                present name. [p. 27.]<lb/>
            The Saracens are the original followers of Mahomet, and came from Arabia: they were a
                refined and ingenious people: their capital Bagdad: their descendants are called the

            <p>The feudal system: this was a scheme for the government of a country, founded upon
                the idea of conquest: the king, or conqueror, [end 184] considered himself as
                becoming owner of the whole country:<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                    the terms of <hi rend="italic">Political Justice</hi>’s critique of the unequal
                    distribution of property. In <hi rend="italic">Political Justice</hi>, Godwin
                    speaks of feudalism as a “ferocious monster,” “the policy of men, who, having
                    first gained a superiority […] have made use of their superiority, for the
                    purpose of conspiring and monopolizing whatever their rapacity could seize” (II:

                condition upon which they held it, was that of joining him in the field, whenever he
                expected to encounter an enemy: he let it at first for a few months, then for a
                year, then for a small number of years, afterward for life, and at length to the
                tenant and his heirs: each new tenant, from father to son, paid a gratuity to be
                admitted to possession: the king was his guardian if he were under age, and
                determined whom he should marry: the tenants were considered as menial servants to
                their superior; they were his cup-bearers, his stewards, his masters of the horse,
                masters of the hounds, and grooms of the [end 185] bedchamber: whenever there was no
                heir, the estate went back to the king: the king's tenants had other tenants under
                them: and the people of the conquered country for the most part were made slaves:
                this was the contrivance of a barbarous age, but it had a great deal of method in
                it. [p. 31, 71, 82.]<lb/>
            Chivalry: an institution, which grew out of the feudal system: the king's tenants,
                when they served him in war, came on horseback, clad in complete armour: these
                persons were called knights: their armour was heavy, and, when they did not want to
                use it, they had a servant who followed them, and carried it for them: he was called
                the esquire, or armour-bearer: as there was in these times no learn- [end 186] ing,
                and few books, the knights had nothing to do, but to learn their exercise. [p. 27,
                77, 82.] <lb/>
            Knight-errantry: as the knights had learned nothing else, they were very eager to
                make use of the little they knew: in savage countries there is not always a law and
                a justice at hand to correct every thing that goes wrong: therefore the most active
                of the knights became errants, or wanderers, roaming the country to assist the weak
                and oppressed: females were oftener oppressed than men: therefore they principally
                enquired after any injuries that had been done to the ladies.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In “Of Diffidence” in <hi rend="italic">Thoughts on

                    reserve.</note> [p. 77.] <lb/>
            Tournaments: as the knights we have been speaking of learned nothing perfectly but
                their exercise, they were eager not only to make use, but to make a show, of what
                [end 187] they knew: this was the meaning of tournaments, where frequently hundreds
                of knights met: they had single combats, not for anger, but a trial of skill: they
                often clashed together in companies, in imitation of a battle: the ladies sat round
                in boxes or booths to see all that passed: and, when it was over, the victors in the
                tournament went to the place where the lady highest in rank was seated, and she
                bestowed upon them a garland, or some other mark of her approbation, to signify that
                she was satisfied with what they had done. [p. 79.] [end 188.]</p>

                    “foreign wars,” and for sustaining a corrupt and overcomplex government
                    bureaucracy (1798, II: 309-10, 315). The <hi rend="italic">History of the

                    “one of the most extraordinary men in the records of mankind (I: 11-12). Hampden

                about one thousand five hundred years before Christ: the following divisions of the
                volume consist of the history of the Judges and Kings of the Jews, the works of
                David and Solomon, and the sublime writings of the prophets: every Christian ought

                the adored founder of the Christian religion; and the Letters of his twelve
                apostles, or delegates, written for the instruction of the first professors of the
                Christian faith: [end 213] the New Testament was written in Greek. [p. 90, 131.]<lb/>
            Homer: he is usually considered as the father of that poetry, which is not
                appropriated to the uses of religion: he lived nine hundred years before Christ: his
                works are the Iliad, a historical poem on the siege of Troy, and the Odyssey, a
                historical poem on Ulysses, one of the Grecian kings by whom Troy was destroyed: it
                has been doubted whether Homer could either read or write, and whether his poems
                were not handed down for a long time, like those of our British Druids, by memory
                only: as Homer is the oldest, so he is perhaps the most perfect, of the poets. [p.
                15, 115.]<lb/>
            Pindar: he wrote principally Odes on [end 214] the Grecian chariot-races and other
                games: Homer and Pindar are considered as the sublimest of the Grecian poets. [p.
                115.]<lb/>
            Sophocles wrote one hundred and twenty tragedies, and lived ninety years: the city of
                Athens laid out 20,000<hi rend="italic">l.</hi> in the decorations of one of his
                plays. [p. 123.]<lb/>
            Euripides wrote seventy-five tragedies: he and Sophocles lived at the same time, and
                emulated each other in the exhibition of tragic merit. [p. 123.]<lb/>
            Plato: he is one of the most admired of the prose-writers of Greece: he wrote on
                moral philosophy, political philosophy, and the principles of the universe, with all
                the fire and imagination of a poet. [p. 115.]<lb/>
            Menander wrote one hundred and eight comedies. [p. 123.] [end 215]</p>
            
            <p>IN ANCIENT ROME.<lb/>
            Terence: we possess of this writer six elegant comedies. [p. 123.]<lb/>
            Caesar: he was a great general, and enslaved his country: he wrote Commentaries, or
                the history of his own wars. [p. 12.]<lb/>
            Virgil: he wrote the Aeneid, a historical poem on Aeneas, one of the kings who
                defended Troy, and who was regarded by the Roman people as their founder: his poem
                has been so much admired, that when we would speak of the best poets, it is usual to
                join together Virgil and Homer. [p. 15.]<lb/>
            Ovid: he is called the poet of love: several fine works of Ovid remain: Medea, and
                admired tragedy of his composing, is lost. [p. 123.]<lb/>
            Seneca: only seven of the ancient Roman tragedies have been pre- [end 216] served:
                they bear the name of Seneca, but it is uncertain by whom they were written. [p.

            The Druids: from the disinterestedness of these memorable personages, [end 217] or
                from accident, we only know that many thousands of verses were composed by them, but
                we are unacquainted with the name of any of the authors: an inferior class in the
                Druidical establishment are the Bards, who made heroic songs of the great actions of
                their countrymen: in allusion to them a poet is frequently in modern speech
                denominated a Bard: probably no genuine compositions of the ancient heathen Druids
                or Bards are preserved. [p. 12, 69.]<lb/>
            The Scalds, called also the Scandinavian or Runic poets: these were the poets of our
                northern ancestors, particularly the Danes: the names of some of these poets and
                several of their works, are preserved. [p. 25.]<lb/>
            The Minstrels: these were the poets [end 218] of the Norman and Plantagenet times:
                both the Minstrels and the Scalds travelled the country, and sung their songs at
                festivals and great men's houses: the Minstrels were the first introducers of
                stage-plays among the moderns. [p. 44, 57, 123.]<lb/>
            The Monks: these were men who lived together in large houses called monasteries and
                convents: they engaged by a vow never to marry: as there was no such thing as
                printing, a part of their employment was transcribing books: and, as the monks were
                very numerous, and had a great deal of leisure, they wrote many books themselves in
                the Latin language, some so well that they have passed for works of the ancient
                Romans: they made also religious plays in emulation of [end 219] the profane plays
                of the Minstrels: the most profound and excellent writers among the Monks are a set
                of men known by the name of the Schoolmen: of these Duns Scotus and Thomas Aquinas
                are the most celebrated. [p.48, 123.]</p>
