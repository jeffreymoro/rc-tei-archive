                <p rend="noCount" rendition="#firstline">In answer to the very kind &amp;
                    affectionate enquiries of M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> R. &amp; yourself concerning
                    the unfortunate situation of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Barbauld I must give you a
                    short history of his case, the peculiarities of which you, who have known him so
                    long, will be well able to enter into. I cannot say that this event has been
                    altogether unexpected, for, besides the natural extreme irritability of his
                    temper &amp; a family disposition to great irregularity of spirits,<note
                        place="foot" resp="editors"> "A family disposition": See <title level="m"
                            >ALBVE</title>, Appendix B: <title level="a">Rochemont Barbauld's
                            Disorder.</title></note> nearly the same train of symptoms of mental
                    derangement occurred several months ago, which though they did not proceed to
                    any act of outrage were amply sufficient to give a foreboding of a future &amp;
                    more violent attack. He did however compleatly recover from the former
                    unfortunate state of mental irritation after having suffered an equal depression
                    of spirits, but I am grieved to say that at present the hopes of a permanent
                    recovery appear very far distant.</p>

                <p rend="noCount" rendition="#pIndent">The present attack may be traced in its beginning to an unusual
                    eagerness for argument &amp; debate of all kinds, an extremely disputatious
                    spirit &amp; unbounded fluency of words which had been occasionally remarked by
                    several of his friends, &amp; in mixed company only enlivened the conversation.
                    Still however it was observed that only one or two favourite topics particularly
                    of a religious nature could interest him &amp; these he was constantly recurring
                    to. Added to this there came on such an excessive increase of all his restless
                    personal habits that the day was scarcely sufficient for his numerous little
                    operations about his person. It would have been very fortunate for his friends
                    &amp; M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> B. in particular if this state of mind had gone no
                    further, but the spirit of disputation which in company only led to long
                    arguments on religious topics, in private with M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> B. took
                    the distressing</p>

                <p rend="noCount">[<emph>fol 1<hi rend="sup">v</hi></emph>] turn of incessant unkind
                    harassing on the merest domestic trifles, during which he was in the habit of
                    insisting in the most peremptory manner on inexhaustible patience in her to
                    listen for hours together to his fancied complaints &amp; even went so far as
                    frequently to use the most insulting &amp; unhandsome language &amp; to lock the
                    door to prevent her from escaping from his violence. The distress &amp; anxiety
                    which such treatment produced on her feeling heart you will readily conceive,
                    &amp; I as well [as] many other of her friends can bear witness to
                    the extreme forbearance which she shewed, being aware of the unsettled state of
                    his mind &amp; the frequent threats of suicide with which his fits of fury were
                    accompanied whenever she made any attempts to escape from them. This kind of
                    usage however was proceeding so far &amp; so totally destroying all her comfort
                    &amp; occupying all her time, that her friends had actually resolved to make a
                    strong remonstrance to him, when <del rend="overstrike">the</del> a most violent
                    paroxysm came on during which after a storm of the most furious &amp; shocking
                    language he was induced to threaten both her life &amp; his own, &amp; on her
                    escaping from him he actually put in execution the threat against himself by
                    taking a large quantity of laudanum in presence of his servants who of course
                    spread the alarm over the village &amp; made the circumstance quite public. He
                    was perswaded however to take the proper means to prevent the effect of his
                    rashness, &amp; a day or two after, as I found that the whole of his mental
                    disease took the turn of ^settled^ anger against her, I invited him to Broad
                        St<note place="foot" resp="editors"> CRA's residence at this time was in
                        Broad Street, London.</note> where he stayed a week. During the time he was
                    with us, his opinion of fancied ill usage on the part of M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>
                    B. remained unalterable, though he expressed the highest esteem &amp; even love
                    for her &amp; was readily brought to an acknowledgement of the impropriety of
                    his conduct. Under these circumstances we thought that he might be trusted to
                    return to Newington under a most solemn promise of refraining from all violence
                    towards her &amp; of allowing her a separate bed &amp; sitting room to which she
                    might retire at all times, &amp; though he still fully insisted on an ample
                    discussion of his supposed grievances &amp; fully expected great concessions on
                    her</p>

                <p rend="noCount">[<emph>fol 2<hi rend="sup">r</hi></emph>] part before he would
                    consent to live again with her, we were in hopes that in time these preposterous
                    ideas would subside &amp; his mind resume its usual serenity. This we ^the^ more
                    repeated, as he was at all times ready to allow even with utmost vehemence of
                    expression the great degree to which he had been indebted to her kindness her
                    excellent conduct during life, &amp; as the sum total of his grievances was only
                    her refusing to persevere in discussing with him, <del rend="overstrike"
                        >his</del> which for reasons which I have already mentioned she most
                    prudently declined. I should add that he has at all times expressed a perfect
                    acquiescence in the proposal of separation &amp; on the most liberal pecuniary
                    terms, but he has at the same time accompanied this with <del rend="overstrike"
                        >such</del> strong expressions of distress amounting to despair at being
                    obliged to resort to this alternative, &amp; with very unequivocal hints at
                    suicide if compelled to it.</p>

                <p rend="noCount" rendition="#pIndent">But he had no sooner returned to Newington than he resumed the
                    subjects of altercation which were always uppermost in his mind, &amp; one
                    morning in direct violation of his promise he again resorted to the same
                    violence of language, to locking her up with him &amp; to the threats of
                    suicide, &amp; in the course of the morning his frenzy became so violent that my
                        father<note place="foot" resp="editors"> "My father": JA, CRA's biological
                        father.</note> was at last, after waiting to the utmost, compelled to put
                    him under confinement in his own house. He is now sufficiently tranquil, though
                    immoveable as to the particular points of his insanity, highly indignant at his
                    confinement &amp; the supposed conspiracy against him, &amp; to any common
                    friend he talks with so much plausibility &amp; coolness as would impose on any
                    one unacquainted with the previous circumstances. He is fully buoyed up with the
                    hope of perswading all the world to be on his side &amp; I believe partly for
                    that reason he has such a guard on his conduct that no personal restraint has
                    been necessary, so that his confinement is as gentle as possible. My father has
                    taken the opinions of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Haslam &amp; D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                    however that M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> B. can never safely continue to live with him. The very
