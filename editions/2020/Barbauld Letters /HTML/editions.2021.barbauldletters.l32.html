            <p class="noCount">You will I am sure think it natural that I should wish to mingle my feelings with
               yours on the event which has recently taken place. And, dear as the excellent woman
               who is departed was to you by every tie of affection &amp; relationship, I feel assured
               that you, as well as myself, must have looked upon her departure as a happy release
               rather than a deprivation of any joy or comfort. And how soothing it is to reflect
               that every pang is past, every struggle over, to gaze at the quiet composure of the
               lifeless form &amp; to think that the soul is entered into its eternal rest, that its
               fate is sealed, its reward is sure——The tears I know will flow, but they will not
               be bitter tears, they will be accompanied in you with the recollection of days &amp; years
               spent in the uninterrupted exercise of kindness on the one side, of duty &amp; affection
               on the other, no regrets, no remorse, no voice crying at the bottom of the heart,
               Oh if I had her again how differently would I behave to her! nothing but that

                  of things to experience &amp; with regard to which one of your principles well knows where

                  so much kind &amp; assiduous attention to the dear sufferer, &amp; she, I am sure, would feel
                  the consolation of leaving her daughter in such kind hands—I shall be glad to hear
                  that your health has not suffered. I write, not knowing at present where you are,
                  but I presume I shall gain the information from Chiswel Street.

                  I have seen lately some of our Hampstead friends, who always mention you with great
                  interest. As I doubt not but you feel the same for them, you will perhaps be glad
                  to hear that Sophia Hoare is going to be married, &amp; yet I do not know whether there
                  is much room for joy either, for the man is a widower with six children. His name
                  is Powell.
