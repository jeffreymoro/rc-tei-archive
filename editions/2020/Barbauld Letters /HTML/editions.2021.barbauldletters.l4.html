                  your journey. I hope it has been a happy one, &amp; that your dear invalid has been able
                  to bear the exertion without detriment— Our rambles are drawing near a close, as perhaps
                  you will say it is time they should. We hope to see Hampstead

                  </div> again on Friday evening. I wrote to you, I think, from Wales. We fulfilled our intention
                  of crossing the water to Minehead from whence it is but 40 miles of very pleasant
                  country to Exeter; but we had such an unfavourable passage that we more than once
                  repented our arrangement, as we were four &amp; twenty hours in very bad weather,

                  done in three or four. We got safe however, but so deranged was I with the sickness,
                  that my stomach did not recover its tone all the while I was at Exeter——From Minehead
                  to Dulverton &amp; from thence to Tiverton is a charming country, finely wooded with little
                  rural streams foaming over the pebbles, a striking contrast <br/> <span class="catchword">to</span></p>

                  very well; they enquired much after you &amp; M<sup>rs</sup> Rickards, &amp; desired to be kindly remembered to you both. M<sup>rs</sup> Kenrick I think is more active than ever, her powers seem to encrease with the demand
                  for them, which is pretty great, considering that the children, five in number, are
                  all at home, &amp; that (M<sup>r</sup> Kenrick &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Bretland having begun an Academy at Exeter) she is again called upon to receive boarders.

                           Kenrick's partner in his new school was the Rev. Joseph Bretland (1742–1819).</span></div>
                  </div> Exeter is not at [“at” <em>written over</em> “all”] all a pretty town, but the country about it is rich fruitful &amp; well wooded.
                  The weather did not favour us here much more than in Wales, therefore we only made
                  one excursion, which was to Exmouth, a place, you know, I believe, better than myself,

                  </div> &amp; will no doubt agree with me in thinking a most chearful beautiful spot. To walk
                  thro a corn field by the sea side was new to me, &amp; almost reconciled me to the element
                  which had lately appeared so formidable. We left Exeter yesterday, the day was completely
                  fine, &amp; we were much gratified with the view of Taunton Glastonbury

               a fine tower, is like a piece of filligree work, so light &amp; elegant is it, tho the
               windows are all worked in stone— We got to Bath after dark &amp; the various buildings
               by the light of the lamps looked like a nest of glow worms— You will give me the pleasure
               of hearing from you when you have fixed your return, which I hope however our’s will
               not hasten, as you [<em>tear</em>]t off so much later— Affectionate compts to M<sup>rs</sup> Rickards &amp; all who remember us at Birmingham
