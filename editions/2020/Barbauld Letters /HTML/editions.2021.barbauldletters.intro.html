               <p>In 1785 Anna Letitia Barbauld and her husband Rochemont resigned from the boys’ school
                  at Palgrave in Suffolk, which they had made famous. Thereafter Anna Letitia did no
                  further schoolteaching, but she remained a teacher: she took private pupils, sometimes
                  teaching them in small groups and sometimes writing instructional letters to individuals.
                  Most of the pupils identified today were the sons and daughters of family friends
                  such as the Carrs of Hampstead—chiefly the daughters, for Barbauld devoted most of
                  her post-Palgrave teaching to the education of girls and young women. Barbauld may
                  have taken her first female pupil informally while still at Palgrave: Judith Dixon,
                  of Norwich, afterwards Mrs. Beecroft, who was perhaps 14 when they met, and who as
                  Mrs. Beecroft remained a friend. Barbauld’s friendship with Beecroft is documented
                  by letters to her published by Lucy Aikin in <em>The Works of Anna Lætitia Barbauld</em> (1825).
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                           spelling.</span></div>
                  </div> After settling in Hampstead in the later 1780s, Barbauld tutored Flora Wynch, a paying
                  pupil and the daughter of a neighbor. Other pupils were the daughters of Barbauld’s
                  friend Susannah Taylor of Norwich, Grace Fletcher from Edinburgh (“I wished my dear
                  child to have a high standard of intellectual and moral perfection, and in placing
                  her with Mrs. Barbauld I had my wish accomplished,” wrote her mother), and “S. S.
                  S.,” also from Edinburgh, who published a work of “young-adult” fiction called <em>Thornton Hall; or, Six Months at School</em> (1823) and dedicated it to Barbauld in thanks for “that kind care which I experienced,
                  during those happy days of my childhood which I passed under your friendly roof.”

                  </div> To some parents, Barbauld’s tutelage appeared to threaten gender or religious ideologies.
                  Mary Anne Galton’s mother pulled Mary Anne back when Barbauld encouraged her to write
                  for publication, and Sarah Hoare’s father, a Quaker, worried about Barbauld’s influence
                  on his daughter’s religious views.

               <p>Pupils who came from a distance might live with the Barbaulds in Hampstead or, after
                  September 1802, in Stoke Newington, for months at a time. S.S.S.’s memory of Barbauld’s
                  “friendly roof” chimes with other recollections of Barbauld’s conduct as a mentor.
                  Grace Fletcher felt put at ease by Barbauld’s “indulgence for the fancies and even
                  follies of youth.” An American woman, Eliza Ware Rotch, remembered Barbauld “as a
                  sweet-looking, lively old lady, wearing her gray hair, which was then very uncommon,
                  and reading aloud to a circle of young people.” Rotch also remembered one of Barbauld’s
                  teaching methods: after reading the description of the character Meg Merrilies in
                  Scott’s <em>Guy Mannering</em> (1815), Barbauld “asked us all to draw the Gypsy as we imagined her.”

                  Martineau, a family friend but not formally a pupil, recalled: “I remember her gentle
                  lively voice, and the stamp of superiority on all she said. We knew she was very learned,
                  and we saw she was graceful, and playful, and kindly.”

                           of word-of-mouth and her national reputation as a writer is most likely.</span></div>
                  </div>), and before she came Barbauld prepared her with a list of books she should read,
                  a list that, today, looks formidable for a young teenager: works of history including
                  Gibbon’s <em>History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</em> (1776–1788), Catharine Macaulay’s <em>History of England from the Accession of James I to that of the Brunswick Line</em> (1763–1783), and Voltaire’s history of the reign of Charles XII; works of education
                  and ethics such as Fénelon’s <em>Les aventures de Télémaque</em> (1699; a favorite Barbauld book), and volumes of poetry by Milton, Akenside, Dryden,
                  Gay, Gray, and Thomson.

                           her young-woman pupils to read can be gathered from her anthology for young women,
                           The Female Speaker (1811). Its contents, organized by genre, include excerpts from

                           “On Fashion: A Vision,”
                           afterwards published in John Aikin’s Monthly Magazine 3 (April 1797): 254–56. Whether
                           Barbauld corresponded with Flora after Flora became Mrs. Willis in 1795 is not known.</span></div>
                  </div> In 1808 Lydia married William Withering, son of an eminent botanist. Her afterlife
                  was not happy: in 1815 she suffered an illness that caused permanent dementia; she
                  died, childless, more than 50 years later. The letters Barbauld wrote to her remained
                  in the Rickards family. In November 1891, a collateral descendant, Edith Cordelia
                  Rickards (d. 1929), having sent up a trial balloon with the instructional letters
                  in the <em>Monthly Packet</em>, published excerpts from the social letters in <em>Murray’s Magazine</em>. Those were the texts on which I had to depend in my biography of Barbauld, <em>Voice of the Enlightenment</em> (2008). In 2011, Lydia’s last collateral descendant died childless in a nursing home.
                  By sheer good luck (so the story goes), the packet of letters was rescued by a visitor
                  from what threatened to be disposal, and put to auction (house of Dominic Winter,
                  Cirencester, 11 May 2011). The letters were purchased by a Canadian independent scholar,
                  Joanna Kafarowski, who, five years later, sold them to me. After transcribing and
                  photographing the letters, in August 2016 I delivered them to the Carl H. Pforzheimer
                  Collection of Shelley and His Circle at the New York Public Library, their owner today.

                  Barbauld to Lydia’s mother and the one from Charles Rochemont Aikin detailing the
                  conditions that led to Barbauld’s separation from her husband. This online edition
                  is intended to publish accurate transcriptions of all the social letters, with identifications

                           and, as I argued in a note on them, the transcriptions contain numerous errors that

                  this project I am grateful also to Scott Krawczyk. And to the unknown person who intervened

                  must be deeply grateful.

            <p>The texts of the letters in this web edition represent as fully as practicable the
               written characteristics of the originals. They preserve Barbauld’s spelling, punctuation,
               capitalization, use of superscript letters and catchwords, and paragraphing (as far
               as it can be determined; her dashes sometimes, but not always, indicate new paragraphs).
               Her insertions are indicated by carats (^), her deletions, when readable, by strikethroughs
               (<span class="overstrike"><em>thus</em></span>). Text lost to heavy deletions or defects in the paper is supplied, when inferable,
               within square brackets, and when not inferable by italicized <em>x</em>’s. Terminal punctuation is occasionally supplied editorially. Editorial notes appear
               as italicized interpolations within square brackets. Letters are introduced by their
               cover texts and postmarks (PM, when present); the physical dimensions and watermarks
               of their papers (WM) are noted, as are their Pforzheimer shelfmarks (SM). In all but
               a handful of exceptional instances, annotation is confined to identification of modern
               persons, places, and books mentioned in the letters.
