               <p>I this morning received your kind letter &amp; am much obliged to you for indulging me
                  with it before it was strictly due, if that be the case, for I really do not exactly
                  remember which of us wrote last— I know that as a correspondent I am too often a defaulter,
                  but whenever that happens, if you favour me with a few lines to put me in mind, it
                  will have the best effect in the world. It is heaping coals of fire, you know &amp;c—
                  I am glad to have so good an account of you &amp; M<sup>rs</sup> Rickards, which indeed was but a confirmation of what I received yesterday from your
                  fair friend Miss Newman, &amp; Miss Slater,

                  she will, after this absence, receive more pleasure from a walk by Hampstead pond,
                  than ever she did from walking on the Quay of Marseilles &amp; the view of the Mediterannean,

                  so long among the French, a more circumstantial &amp; authentic account than we have yet

                  but I am not ill. We may hope now, the severest pinch of the season is over——It would
                  do me a great deal of good to see you, I wish you could spend some days with me. Any

                  read M<sup>rs</sup> Opie’s novel, but as you are reading it also, I had rather have your opinion than
                  give you mine. One thing however is certain, that it is not necessary to write 3 Vols
                  in order to prove that a woman who lives with a man without marriage, will lose her
                  reputation[.]

                           and lives openly with her lover, much as Mary Wollstonecraft had done with William
                           Godwin. ALB may have written the review of this novel that appears in her nephew's
                           Annual Review, 4 (1806): 653.</span></div>
                  </div> For, you will observe, her distresses &amp; mortifications all arise from the opinion
                  of the world, not from the nature of the connection itself. She would have been perfectly
                  happy with Glenmurray if she had not been cast out of society, &amp; if he had not died
                  of a consumption; but no woman, I will venture to say, was ever such a martyr to system
                  as to refuse to marry her lover, when he pr[esse]d her to it, &amp; when she meant the
                  connection to be in[dis]soluble. The real danger of such a system, which by the way,
                  is now quite a thing gone by, is that a young woman should, in consequence of it,
                  yield to her passion for a man with whom, from circumstances, marriage is not in her
                  power—There are however pathetic scenes: Glenmurray’s death we were particularly pleased
                  with, &amp; the incident of the pine apple afforded us much discussion— Pray did you know
                  Miss Kelsal one of M<sup>r</sup> Gregory’s pupils? D<sup>r</sup> Lewin, her very constant lover, is coming this week “to make an end of all his wooing”
                  &amp; carry her to Liverpool.
