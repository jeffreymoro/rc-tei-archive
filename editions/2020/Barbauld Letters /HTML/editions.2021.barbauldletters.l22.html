                  </div> I should have sent them sooner, but to tell you the truth they were mislaid &amp; I had
                  a great hunt before I could find them. I see I have them <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span>, &amp; as they come to you so late, I will not ask them again till after you get to Birmingham
                  when I will copy them, which now I have not time for, &amp; return them— I have some hopes

                  </div> with me soon, a journey will do her good &amp; she thinks she may be spared— We are now

                  of early rising, but one day this week M<sup>r</sup> Barbauld &amp; I rose at six &amp; took a long walk &amp; saw the hay-makers male and female coming
                  to their work, all alive &amp; chearful &amp; rejoicing in the fineness of the day—I could
                  not avoid contrasting the scene with Pinchard’s account, which I had just been reading,
                  of the gangs of negroes going out under the whip,

                  </div> &amp; from their indolent movements &amp; the very little work which he says they do, compared
                  with our chearful voluntary labourers, I cannot but think it must be equally impolitic
                  as inhuman— I suppose you are now very near your removal. May it be happy to you,
                  tho it must be lamented by your friends in this part of the country. Affectionate
                  compliments to M<sup>rs</sup> Rickards &amp; Miss Harrop if still with you.
