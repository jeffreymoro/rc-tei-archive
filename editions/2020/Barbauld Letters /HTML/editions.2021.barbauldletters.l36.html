               <p>That it always gives me great pleasure to hear from you I trust you need ^not^ be
                  told, &amp; I have particularly to thank you for your last letter, as it gave me a welcome
                  account of your health &amp; spirits. If I am to begin mine with mentioning our little
                  circle I must advert to the loss we have sustained by the death of poor Sarah Kinder

                  </div>—A loss however to be dated, not from her recent death, but from the obscure slow
                  wasting disorder which hung upon her during all the bloom of youth, &amp;, during the
                  latter months at least of her existence, was attended with so much suffering to herself
                  &amp; so much fatigue &amp; anxiety to all the family that I am sure they must think the last
                  stroke a welcome release. Her two sisters would have been quite worn out had she continued
                  much longer, for nothing would have prevailed upon them to spare themselves by remitting
                  any of their generous cares—They are now going to Tunbridge &amp; Hastings
