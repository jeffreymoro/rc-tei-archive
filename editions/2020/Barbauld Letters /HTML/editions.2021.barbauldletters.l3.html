                           ALB had met them in London earlier in 1799 and visited them in Clifton before crossing
                           to Wales with her and RB's friends the Estlins.</span></div>

                  our view of seeing some of the beautiful part of Wales by the weather, for it rained
                  in torrents during our little journey. We have been in this place a week yesterday,
                  solely for the society of our friends M<sup>r</sup> &amp; M<sup>rs</sup> Estlin,

                  </div> for of picturesque beauties this part of Glamorganshire has not much to boast, except
                  indeed in sea views, which are here very grand. The coast is bold &amp; rocky, &amp; full
                  of caverns. As the sea forms the grand feature of the country, it is likewise the
                  chief source of adventures. Every one has some tale to tell of danger &amp; escape from
                  that formidable enemy. One has been wrecked on the sands &amp; brought off in a small
                  boat which a breath of wind would have overset. Another has been envellop’d while
                  walking on the sands by a sudden fog &amp; obliged

                  carried away by the current while bathing, &amp; a fourth overtaken by the tide in some
                  of the recesses of the rocks, &amp; nearly cut off from the possibility of return. To
                  the gloomy terror of these ideas, the weather, since we came here, has much contributed,
                  for we have not had one day free from rain &amp; some very stormy. We have had fires every
                  day, &amp; so has every body else that I have seen. Besides the influence of the cool
                  breezes from the sea, the walls are built with sea sand which never thoroughly dries.
                  There are no houses here to be had but cottages, not like Lady Camelford’s,

                  of Bridgend, which is four miles off, &amp; I was obliged to send there for a pen before
                  I could write to you—In short nothing can be more compleat retirement than this place.
