                <p>In 1785 Anna Letitia Barbauld and her husband Rochemont resigned from the boys’
                    school at Palgrave in Suffolk, which they had made famous. Thereafter Anna
                    Letitia did no further schoolteaching, but she remained a teacher: she took
                    private pupils, sometimes teaching them in small groups and sometimes writing
                    instructional letters to individuals. Most of the pupils identified today were
                    the sons and daughters of family friends such as the Carrs of Hampstead—chiefly
                    the daughters, for Barbauld devoted most of her post-Palgrave teaching to the
                    education of girls and young women. Barbauld may have taken her first female
                    pupil informally while still at Palgrave: Judith Dixon, of Norwich, afterwards
                    Mrs. Beecroft, who was perhaps 14 when they met, and who as Mrs. Beecroft
                    remained a friend. Barbauld’s friendship with Beecroft is documented by letters
                    to her published by Lucy Aikin in <title level="m">The Works of Anna Lætitia
                        Barbauld</title> (1825).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Barbauld herself
                        did not always use the digraph æ in her middle name. I use the simpler
                        spelling.</note> After settling in Hampstead in the later 1780s, Barbauld
                    tutored Flora Wynch, a paying pupil and the daughter of a neighbor. Other pupils
                    were the daughters of Barbauld’s friend Susannah Taylor of Norwich, Grace
                    Fletcher from Edinburgh (“I wished my dear child to have a high standard of
                    intellectual and moral perfection, and in placing her with Mrs. Barbauld I had
                    my wish accomplished,” wrote her mother), and “S. S. S.,” also from Edinburgh,
                    who published a work of “young-adult” fiction called <title level="m">Thornton
                    Hall; or, Six Months at School</title> (1823) and dedicated it to Barbauld
                    in thanks for “that kind care which I experienced, during those happy days of my
                    childhood which I passed under your friendly roof.”<note place="foot"

                            Fletcher</title> (Carlisle, UK: privately printed, 1874), quoted in

                        has not been identified.</note> To some parents, Barbauld’s tutelage
                    appeared to threaten gender or religious ideologies. Mary Anne Galton’s mother
                    pulled Mary Anne back when Barbauld encouraged her to write for publication, and
                    Sarah Hoare’s father, a Quaker, worried about Barbauld’s influence on his
                    daughter’s religious views.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See <title
                            level="m">ALBVE</title>, 494–95. Barbauld’s religious views were not
                        well known in detail, but they were known to be liberal.</note></p>
                <p>Pupils who came from a distance might live with the Barbaulds in Hampstead or,
                    after September 1802, in Stoke Newington, for months at a time. S.S.S.’s memory
                    of Barbauld’s “friendly roof” chimes with other recollections of Barbauld’s
                    conduct as a mentor. Grace Fletcher felt put at ease by Barbauld’s “indulgence
                    for the fancies and even follies of youth.” An American woman, Eliza Ware Rotch,
                    remembered Barbauld “as a sweet-looking, lively old lady, wearing her gray hair,
                    which was then very uncommon, and reading aloud to a circle of young people.”
                    Rotch also remembered one of Barbauld’s teaching methods: after reading the
                    description of the character Meg Merrilies in Scott’s <title level="m">Guy
                        Mannering</title> (1815), Barbauld “asked us all to draw the Gypsy as we
                    imagined her.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">For all three preceding
                        quotations, see <title level="m">ALBVE</title>, 508.</note> Simply to be in
                    Barbauld’s company could be an instructional experience, as Harriet Martineau, a
                    family friend but not formally a pupil, recalled: “I remember her gentle lively
                    voice, and the stamp of superiority on all she said. We knew she was very
                    learned, and we saw she was graceful, and playful, and kindly.”<note

                <p>Barbauld’s best-documented pupil today is Lydia Rickards (1784–1867), who came
                    from Birmingham in the mid-1790s and settled, with her mother, in Hampstead in
                        1798.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The Hampstead Poor-Rate Books (Camden

                        on Lydia see <title level="m">ALBVE</title>, 392–93 and 644n9.</note>
                    Probably she came recommended (perhaps by a mutual friend<note place="foot"
                        resp="editors">The friend may have been the Rev. Thomas Belsham: See Letter
                        12 below. How Barbauld obtained her pupils is not known, but that she
                        obtained them through a combination of word-of-mouth and her national
                        reputation as a writer is most likely.</note>), and before she came Barbauld
                    prepared her with a list of books she should read, a list that, today, looks
                    formidable for a young teenager: works of history including Gibbon’s <title
                        level="m"> History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</title>
                    (1776–1788), Catharine Macaulay’s <title level="m">History of England from the
                        Accession of James I to that of the Brunswick Line</title> (1763–1783), and
                    Voltaire’s history of the reign of Charles XII; works of education and ethics
                    such as Fénelon’s <title level="m">Les aventures de Télémaque</title> (1699; a
                    favorite Barbauld book), and volumes of poetry by Milton, Akenside, Dryden, Gay,
                    Gray, and Thomson.<note place="foot" resp="editors">E. C. Rickards, <title level="a"

                        <title level="j">Murray’s Magazine</title> 10 (1891): 709. A good idea of
                        the English literature Barbauld expected her young-woman pupils to read can
                        be gathered from her anthology for young women, <title level="m">The Female
                            Speaker</title> (1811). Its contents, organized by genre, include
                        excerpts from works by Hannah More, William Law, John Gregory, Hester Mulso
                        Chapone, Pope, Thomson, Matthew Prior, Isaac Watts, Swift, Addison, Johnson,
                        Maria Edgeworth, Gibbon, Goldsmith, Milton, William Cowper, Erasmus Darwin,
                        Shakespeare, and a surprising number of essays from periodical essay series
                        such as <title level="m">The Adventurer</title>. The number of recent and
                        contemporary writers represented indicates that Barbauld expected young
                        women to be up-to-date on current writing as well as acquainted with English
                        classics.</note> Another young woman, Sarah Taylor, who came from Norwich,
                    read Pope and Boileau (the latter in French), and was expected to keep up her
                    Italian also.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                    described below is a copy of one that Barbauld wrote to a Mr. “Douce,”
                    apparently a tutor, recommending French books for a young reader who may have
                    been Lydia.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Misc. MS 4379, Carl H. Pforzheimer

                        University Press. “Douce” may be the “J. Dowse” to whom Barbauld wrote in
                        1810 recommending books on ancient history for young readers (printed in

                    probably before Barbauld had met her, Barbauld sent her three letters of a
                    purely instructional nature (although also playful in manner).<note place="foot"

                <p>As with other young women Barbauld mentored, Lydia became a friend with whom she
                    visited and to whom she wrote social letters.<note place="foot" resp="editors"
                        >Similarly, with Flora Wynch and her father Barbauld toured Scotland in 1794
                            (<title level="m">ALBVE</title>, 364). Wynch was a favorite pupil; for
                        her Barbauld wrote <title level="a">On Fashion: A Vision,</title> afterwards
                        published in John Aikin’s <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> 3 (April
                        1797): 254–56. Whether Barbauld corresponded with Flora after Flora became
                        Mrs. Willis in 1795 is not known.</note> In 1808 Lydia married William
                    Withering, son of an eminent botanist. Her afterlife was not happy: in 1815 she
                    suffered an illness that caused permanent dementia; she died, childless, more
                    than 50 years later. The letters Barbauld wrote to her remained in the Rickards
                    family. In November 1891, a collateral descendant, Edith Cordelia Rickards (d.
                    1929), having sent up a trial balloon with the instructional letters in the
                        <title level="j">Monthly Packet</title>, published excerpts from the social
                    letters in <title level="j">Murray’s Magazine</title>. Those were the texts on
                    which I had to depend in my biography of Barbauld, <title level="m">Voice of the
                        Enlightenment</title> (2008). In 2011, Lydia’s last collateral descendant
                    died childless in a nursing home. By sheer good luck (so the story goes), the
                    packet of letters was rescued by a visitor from what threatened to be disposal,
                    and put to auction (house of Dominic Winter, Cirencester, 11 May 2011). The
                    letters were purchased by a Canadian independent scholar, Joanna Kafarowski,
                    who, five years later, sold them to me. After transcribing and photographing the
                    letters, in August 2016 I delivered them to the Carl H. Pforzheimer Collection
                    of Shelley and His Circle at the New York Public Library, their owner
                        today.<note place="foot" resp="editors">This account of the history of the

                <p>Barbauld’s letters to Lydia constitute the only long series of Barbauld letters
                    known to survive in manuscript. The collection consists of 39 autograph letters
                    from Barbauld to Lydia (a few others are known to be missing); three from
                    Barbauld to Lydia’s mother; a letter by Barbauld’s nephew and adopted son,
                    Charles Rochemont Aikin, to Lydia; and several other documents. It does not
                    include Lydia’s or her mother’s replies. Five of Barbauld’s surviving letters to
                    Lydia are explicitly instructional and are slated to appear in volume 2 of
                    Barbauld’s <title level="m">Collected Works</title> in progress from Oxford
                    University Press: those on language, Homer, and history, dating to 1800 or
                    slightly later. That edition will not include Barbauld’s social letters.<note
                        place="foot" resp="editors">An exception is letter 1 below, which is both
                        social and pedagogic. It can be argued that even a social letter from
                        Barbauld to a young woman had a pedagogic aspect, for in modeling attention
                        to events and surroundings it encouraged such attention in its
                        recipient.</note> Presented on this website are a total of 38 social
                    letters, including the three from Barbauld to Lydia’s mother and the one from
                    Charles Rochemont Aikin detailing the conditions that led to Barbauld’s
                    separation from her husband. This online edition is intended to publish accurate
                    transcriptions of all the social letters, with identifications of persons and
                    places named in them.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In 2019, <title level="j"
                            >Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature</title> published transcriptions of
                        31 of the social letters to Lydia and her mother. Barbauld’s handwriting is
                        often hard to decipher, and, as I argued in a note on them, the
                        transcriptions contain numerous errors that I seek to correct here. See

                    to Scott Krawczyk. And to the unknown person who intervened to rescue the
                    letters from destruction, everyone interested in Anna Letitia Barbauld must be
                    deeply grateful.</p>

                <p>The texts of the letters in this web edition represent as fully as practicable
                    the written characteristics of the originals. They preserve Barbauld’s spelling,
                    punctuation, capitalization, use of superscript letters and catchwords, and
                    paragraphing (as far as it can be determined; her dashes sometimes, but not
                    always, indicate new paragraphs). Her insertions are indicated by carats (^),
                    her deletions, when readable, by strikethroughs (<del rend="overstrike"
                            ><emph>thus</emph></del>). Text lost to heavy deletions or defects in
                    the paper is supplied, when inferable, within square brackets, and when not
                    inferable by italicized <emph>x</emph>’s. Terminal punctuation is occasionally
                    supplied editorially. Editorial notes appear as italicized interpolations within
                    square brackets. Letters are introduced by their cover texts and postmarks (PM,
                    when present); the physical dimensions and watermarks of their papers (WM) are
                    noted, as are their Pforzheimer shelfmarks (SM). In all but a handful of
                    exceptional instances, annotation is confined to identification of modern
                    persons, places, and books mentioned in the letters.</p>
