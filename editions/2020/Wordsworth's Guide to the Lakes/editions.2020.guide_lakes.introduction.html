            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">Preface to the Second Edition:</span> The initial 2015 release of this <em>Romantic Circles</em> edition of William Wordsworth’s <em>Guide to the Lakes</em> provided unprecedented resources for studying an essay that, over two centuries after
               its first publication, is still considered a classic in the English environmentalist
               tradition and one of its author’s greatest accomplishments in prose. Gratefully, our
               edition has been warmly received and widely used. Subsequent to its completion, however,
               our ongoing research on Wordsworth’s essay has yielded important discoveries about
               its origins, composition, and circulation, many of which elucidate or undercut traditional
               narratives surrounding the <em>Guide</em> that informed our 2015 edition. Accordingly, with <em>Romantic Circles</em>’ support, we set out to update, revise, and supplement our earlier work in this second
               digital edition of Wordsworth’s <em>Guide</em>. (For a full list of changes, see <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.about.html">About This Edition</a>.)
            </p>
            <p class="noCount">The findings that occasioned this edition are presented in a new appendix, <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.serialpublication.html">
                  “The Serial Publication of <em>Select Views</em>,”
                  </a> and the completely revised introduction that follows. This trove of additional material
               may well leave some readers feeling we have crossed the hazy border between the properly
               expansive and genuinely bloated. Bearing this in mind, we have provided links at the
               head of this document allowing readers to go directly to sections of particular interest.
               Section I (<a class="link_ref" href="#section1" title="">A <em>Guide</em> for the Twenty-first Century</a>) of this introduction offers a brief history of reactions to and scholarship on the
               <em>Guide</em> before outlining the purposes and value of this online edition. Section II (<a class="link_ref" href="#section2" title="">Joseph Wilkinson and <em>Select Views</em> [1810]</a>) introduces the amateur artist and former neighbor of the Lake Poets whose series
               of Lake District drawings included the first published version of Wordsworth’s <em>Guide</em>. Sections III (<a class="link_ref" href="#section3" title="">William Wordsworth: Ghost Writer</a>), IV (<a class="link_ref" href="#section4" title="">Drafting and Publishing the First Edition</a>), and V (<a class="link_ref" href="#section5" title="">Expanding and Revising the <em>Guide</em> [1820–1835]</a>) chronicle Wordsworth’s unprecedented—and often fraught—experience working as Wilkinson’s
               pen-for-hire and his obsessive reworkings of the <em>Guide</em> for four new editions published between 1820 and 1835. Finally, Sections VI (<a class="link_ref" href="#section6" title="">Writing the Lake District</a>) and VII (<a class="link_ref" href="#section7" title="">The Originality of Wordsworth’s <em>Guide</em></a>) explore the rise of Lake District tourism during the poet’s lifetime and how his
               <em>Guide</em> both draws upon and surpasses earlier works on the region, the picturesque, and the
               preservation of cherished landscapes.

                           his fifth, and final, revised edition of 1835 A Guide through the District of the
                           Lakes in the North of England. The shorthand Guide to the Lakes became common in the
                           late nineteenth century and even more firmly fixed with Ernest De Sélincourt’s 1906
                           edition, Wordsworth’s Guide to the Lakes (London: Henry Frowde). Keeping with convention,

                  essay on England’s Lake District that its writer had long coveted for his poetry,
                  dubbing it a “very agreeable performance” (the <em>Literary Gazette</em>), “as topographically useful as it is <em>poetically picturesque</em>” (the <em>Monthly Review</em>), and “by far the best specimen of the prose style of Wordsworth which has ever been
                  given to the world” (<em>Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</em>).

                  </div> Fifteen years later, upon receiving the fifth edition of 1835, the <em>Athenaeum</em> gushed, “We could find in our hearts to write a separate article on ‘<em>Wordsworth’s Guide through the districts of the Lakes</em>,’ <em>fifth</em> (it ought to be <em>fifteenth</em>) edition.”

                  </div> While never a runaway bestseller, the <em>Guide</em> became entrenched as the go-to guidebook for nineteenth-century Lake District tourists
                  and has remained a classic study of landscape aesthetics and environmental ethics
                  ever since. In introducing his 1879 edition of Wordsworth’s poems, Matthew Arnold
                  famously recounted how an ill-informed tourist once asked the poet “if he had ever
                  written anything besides the <em>Guide to the Lakes</em>. Yes, he answered modestly, he had written verses.”

                  </div> Two years later, Andrew James Symington conjectured that there was “not an inn or
                  small farmhouse” mentioned in the <em>Guide</em> “which does not reap in hard coin the results.”

                  </div> Even as twentieth-century motorways gradually rendered many of the <em>Guide</em>’s foot-and-carriage itineraries obsolete, enthusiasts for the book redoubled their
                  claims for its timelessness. No less a card-carrying modernist than Virginia Woolf
                  revered it as a “happily permanent friend” that offered “all the courtesy and consideration
                  of an old inhabitant who does the honours of the place to a stranger.”

                  </div> And, at the opposite end of the twentieth century, the pioneering eco-critic Jonathan
                  Bate bemoaned scholarly neglect of this “exemplar of Romantic ecology,” insisting
                  that, “If we are to historicize Romanticism, we must bring the <em>Guide</em> from the periphery to the centre.”

                  </div> As detailed below, he originally drafted this topographic, historical, and cultural
                  introduction to his native region as the anonymous letterpress for <em>Select Views in Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire</em> (1810), a set of 48 prints of landscape sketches by the Reverend Joseph Wilkinson
                  (1764–1831). In the years ahead, Wordsworth trimmed the roughly 27,700-word essay
                  of 1810 to 20,200 words, meticulously revised the remaining sections, and published
                  it under his own name as an appendix to his <em>River Duddon</em> collection of 1820. Deciding soon thereafter to repurpose his essay as a full-fledged
                  guidebook, he expanded it to 29,800 words for the first stand-alone version of the <em>Guide</em> of 1822 and made further additions and revisions for new editions of 1823 (35,300
                  words) and 1835 (38,300 words). Finally, in 1842, having shepherded five editions
                  of the <em>Guide</em> to press over three decades, the 72-year-old Wordsworth supervised the Kendal publishers
                  Hudson and Nicholson’s reprinting of his 1835 text in a volume including Adam Sedgwick’s
                  groundbreaking studies of Lake District geology.

                           for in textual histories of the Guide, Wordsworth remained actively involved in the

                  1823, 1835, 1842, 1843, 1846, 1853, and 1859. Then, thanks to Wordsworth’s lofty status
                  among the Victorians and the expiration of the 1835 edition’s copyright in 1877, it
                  regularly resurfaced in complete-works collections and new-generation travel guides.
                  Inexplicably, however, nearly a half-century passed between the 1859 printing and
                  the next stand-alone version, the Ernest De Sélincourt edition of 1906 that introduced
                  Wordsworth’s essay to a new generation of readers. Over the rest of the twentieth
                  century, it remained generally available, whether through 1926 and 1970 reissues of

                  Since 1974, the standard scholarly text has been the version in volume 2 of W. J.
                  B. Owen and Jane Worthington Smyser’s <em>Prose Works of William Wordsworth</em>. Unfortunately, though, this remarkably thorough and reliable edition only appeared
                  as an expensive, three-volume library set and has long been out of print.

               <p>As noted above, the earliest version of Wordsworth’s <em>Guide to the Lakes</em> appeared as the anonymous prose supplement to the Rev. Joseph Wilkinson’s <em>Select Views in Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire</em>, a series of engravings sold primarily to affluent collectors of landscape prints
                  and associates of the artist.

                           and Lancashire (Liverpool: James Smith). For details on the collecting of prints,

                  </div> During the interim between Wilkinson’s offering the commission in mid-1809 and Wordsworth’s
                  completing it in late 1810, the two never spoke in person, as the poet lived in Grasmere
                  in the Lake District and the artist 300 miles to the southeast in Thetford, Norfolk,
                  where he served as rector of East and West Wretham and domestic chaplain to the Marquis
                  of Huntly. Wilkinson was a Lakelander at heart, however. After being raised in Carlisle,
                  he left for Cambridge in his late teens before returning in 1794, at age thirty, when
                  his wife became the caregiver for her ailing uncle, the renowned chemist William Brownrigg.
                  During the decade they ultimately spent at Ormathwaite Hall, Brownrigg’s home near
                  Keswick, Wilkinson devoted his time to sketching the region’s beauties and serving
                  as curate of Irthington (near Carlisle) and Monkwearmouth (near Sunderland).

                           his life. A brief obituary in the Gentleman’s Magazine noted his Oct. 1831 death (Nov.

               <p>During their final years in Ormathwaite, the Wilkinsons befriended the families of
                  Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey, who resided at Greta Hall in nearby Keswick.

                           they didn’t relocate to Keswick until September 1803.</span></div>
                  </div> This, in turn, brought them into the orbit of the Wordsworths. Dorothy Wordsworth’s
                  journals from 1802 capture growing intimacy with the Wilkinsons, recording her brother
                  and Coleridge visiting Ormathwaite, the families dining together in Keswick, her walking
                  “with Mrs. W. [to] the Quakers’ meeting,” and their receiving “Wilkinson’s drawings”
                  by post.

                           and Alfoxden Journals, ed. Pamela Woof (Oxford: Oxford UP, 2002). Woof suggests Wordsworth
                           may have met Wilkinson as early as 1794, as the clergyman’s sisters had married brothers
                           of the poet’s friend James Losh (p. 229). For additional interactions between the
                           families, see Reed, Middle Years, 157, 163–64, and 184. That Dorothy knew the Ormathwaite
                           house well is suggested by a 1 Jan. 1810 letter to her childhood friend Jane Marshall
                           in which she opines, “the imagination cannot conceive a more delightful place…</span></div>
                  </div> Of the three Lake Poets, Southey was apparently closest to Wilkinson. In a 7 January
                  1804 letter to William Taylor, Southey mentions how Wilkinson “is my neighbour at
                  present &amp; a very excellent one I find him.”

                  </div> Two years later, after the Wilkinsons had moved to Thetford, Southey made a lengthy
                  detour to visit them during a trip to the south. Writing his wife back in Keswick,
                  the poet reported that their old neighbor remained “the very cream of human kindness.”
                  Still, having moved to a region “utterly without beauty,” the couple openly pined
                  for the Lakes. Wilkinson, he reports, grew sentimental “at the thought of Ormathwaite,”
                  and “Mrs W. never looks at the drawing of it but the tears come in her eyes.”

                  Why <em>Northern Scenery</em> never went to press remains a mystery, as Wilkinson not only completed forty-nine
                  drawings for the series but also commissioned the Manchester artist William Marshall
                  Craig to design a title page and multiple frontispieces (figs. 1 and 2).

In his <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.1810.html#dedication">dedication to the 1810 series</a>, Wilkinson thanks Thomas Wallace, a Penrith estate-owner and politician, for having
                  “frequently approved and encouraged the efforts of my pencil” and “excited the first
                  idea of publishing a selection of my views.” Another enthusiastic supporter was Sarah
                  Murray, a pioneering woman travel writer who, in her 1799 guidebook to North Britain,
                  insists that “no pencil, that I have ever seen, has produced the <em>genuine</em> tint and style of that country, in any degree equal to the drawings of my friend the
                  Rev. Mr. Wilkinson, of Ormathwaite; who has, in his representations, exhibited the
                  character of the Lakes in as great perfection as is possible for imitation to attain.”

               <p>Buoyed by such support, in late 1808 Wilkinson circulated his first call for subscribers
                  to <em>Select Views</em> in small newspapers serving his Thetford parish. (For full details on his decision
                  to publish serially and by subscription, see <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.serialpublication.html">Appendix 1</a>.) At this point, Wilkinson planned to include sketches of the two principal Lake
                  District counties, Cumberland and Westmoreland, plus “Part of Scotland.” He also apparently
                  imagined a primarily local subscriber base, as he confined his advertisements to the
                  nearby <em>Bury and Norwich Post</em> and <em>Norfolk Chronicle</em> and directed would-be subscribers to the town booksellers in Thetford and Bury (fig.
                  3). Yet, for a first-time author preparing what was essentially a vanity publication,
                  Wilkinson displayed an impressive understanding of the conventional design, distribution,

                           brother, an Oxford man, who both take sketches well themselves” (273). Grant’s

                  “14 inches by 10 inches” to be distributed four at a time over 12 months, “executed
                  by the most eminent Artists,” and printed on quality paper that would “admit of tinting”—closely
                  corresponded with what subscribers actually received in 1810.

                           in Owen and Smyser, Prose Works (2:124) and Reed, Middle Years (p. 671). Two details
                           suggest this undated letter was written in early June 1809. First, Wilkinson reports
                           having read “with much pleasure &amp; interest” the first issue of Coleridge’s The Friend,
                           which appeared on 1 June 1809. Second, in a separate letter dated 10 June 1809, Wordsworth
                           conveys to the publisher of The Friend names and addresses for four new subscribers
                           that Wilkinson had forwarded in his letter (Letters, 8: 17–18). In early June, Coler…</span></div>
                  </div> From this, however, we can infer the existence of two earlier letters: an initial
                  query from Wilkinson to Coleridge and a reply indicating Wordsworth’s potential willingness
                  to contribute if assured <em>Select Views</em> would not compete with a similar series his friend William Green would soon release.
                  Wilkinson’s response tackles this concern head-on, reporting, “I am just returned
                  from Town, where I have been making arrangements for my publication, and as I have
                  seen some of Mr Green[’]s numbers I will be obliged to you if you will tell our friend
                  Wordsworth—that no two works, descriptive of the same country can be more different,

                  </div> Still open to Coleridge’s involvement as well, Wilkinson continues, “I shall write
                  to Mr Wordsworth in a few days more fully upon the subject, when I hope either Mr
                  W— or yourself, or both, will afford me the assistance I shall explain to enable me

               <p>Wordsworth’s subsequent acceptance of Wilkinson’s commission has long struck the poet's
                  enthusiasts as a lamentable blight on a career otherwise distinguished for its single-minded
                  independence. Only eight months earlier, Wordsworth had bristled at the Rev. Joseph
                  Pering’s suggestion that he write a prose description of his native region. “Alas!,”
                  he declared, “you have but a faint notion how disagreeable writing, of all Sorts,
                  is to me, except from the impulse of the moment. I must be my own Task master or I
                  can do nothing at all.”

                  himself to a role that was more pen-for-hire than equal partner or co-visionary, has
                  bewildered many. The most common interpretation is that proffered by Owen and Smyser,
                  who put the case bluntly: “That Wordsworth should accept Joseph Wilkinson as his ‘Task
                  master’ for even the briefest time surely indicates some kind of financial hardship.”

                  rapidly growing household with no counterbalancing source of income. His 1807 collection, <em>Poems, in Two Volumes</em>, which all had hoped would stabilize his finances and usher him into the front ranks
                  of living bards, had largely floundered. Reflecting on just how unprofitable poetry
                  had proven, Wordsworth would estimate in 1812 that he had earned less than £140 for
                  all his verse since 1798.

                  projects offering surer pay. Dorothy reported to Thomas De Quincey on 1 May 1809—just
                  weeks before the arrival of Wilkinson’s offer—of her brother’s “resolution to write
                  upon publick affairs in the <em>Courier</em>, or some other newspaper, for the sake of getting money; not wholly however on that
                  account for unless he were animated by the importance of his subject and the hope

                  </div> That similar motives factored into William's accepting the <em>Select Views</em> commission is suggested by Dorothy’s musing six months letter, in an 18 November 1809
                  letter to Catherine Clarkson, “if he were to write a Guide to the Lakes and prefix
                  this preface [to <em>Select Views</em>], it would sell better, and bring him more money than any of his higher labours.”
                  She goes on to note that William, too, “has some thoughts of doing this,” but asks

                  original draft of the <em>Guide to the Lakes</em> fundamentally compromised, even mercenary, is to concede to the Romantic—and, ironically,
                  Wordsworthian—ideology that inspired art must be impervious to external concerns.

                  to write Wilkinson’s letterpress. While the Wordsworths’ economic distress is palpable
                  in surviving letters from 1809, so too is the poet’s perpetual fear that Coleridge,
                  who had moved in with them in 1808, was veering toward complete mental breakdown while
                  frenetically attempting to launch his new weekly, <em>The Friend</em>. In light of this, Wordsworth’s chief incentive for taking the commission may well
                  have been a fear that, were he to reject it, the already teetering Coleridge would
                  feel duty-bound to accept it out of obligation to an old neighbor who had, after all,
                  approached him, not Wordsworth.

               <p>For that matter, it is entirely possible that foremost in Wordsworth’s mind when accepting
                  Wilkinson’s offer was neither his family’s dire finances nor his friend’s fragility
                  but his own artistic, intellectual, and personal enthusiasm for the proposed project.
                  The <em>Select Views</em> opportunity arrived during what would prove Wordsworth’s most sustained period of
                  prose composition. In 1809 and 1810 alone, he wrote 30,000-plus words for <em>Select Views</em>, the 216-page polemic <em>The Convention of Cintra</em>, and four lengthy essays intended for <em>The Friend</em>.

                  from this period, and years later he allegedly claimed “there were three callings

                  been intellectual comes in accounts from preceding years showing him seriously considering
                  writing on the topics Wilkinson now proposed. The diary of the Whig grandee Lady Holland
                  chronicles how, at a late August 1807 dinner party in Windermere, Wordsworth claimed
                  to be “preparing a manual to guide travelers in their tour amongst the Lakes”; and,
                  in a letter from October 1808, Wordsworth himself reports: “Last autumn, I made a
                  little Tour, with my wife, and she was very anxious that I should preserve the memory
                  of it by a written account. I tried to comply with her entreaty, but an insuperable
                  dullness came over me, and I could make no progress.” Close familiarity with the region,
                  he feared, had left him “utterly at a loss” as to “where to begin, and where to end”
                  on the subject of “these Lakes and mountains” (<a class="link_ref" href="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.letters.html#letter2">letter 2</a>).

                           exaggerated his actual progress to Lady Holland, as no evidence suggests he had made
                           headway on a “manual to guide travelers” prior to their dinner. Her diary entry also

                  project in the summer of 1809. Oddly enough, however, Wilkinson stayed close-lipped
                  about having secured the poet’s services. The final calls for subscribers to <em>Select Views</em> touted his agreements with Rudolph Ackermann, the elite London print dealer who had
                  signed on as publisher, and W. F. Wells, a London engraver “whose professional merits

                  be penned by the region’s most famous living writer (figs. 5 and 6). The unmistakable
                  conclusion, then, is that, consistent with the logic of vanity publishing, Wilkinson
                  had sought out the Lake Poets not to capitalize on their reputations but, by presenting
                  their words as his own, to cast himself in the best possible light. He implies as
                  much in his previously cited letter to Coleridge from June 1809, which explains his

               <p>By agreeing to help Wilkinson in this capacity, Wordsworth—the poet who came to define
                  for many the ideal of an inspired, autonomous modern author—ironically took on the
                  most unlikely of roles: the ghost writer. Not that Wordsworth would have conceived
                  of it as such, as the term wouldn’t be coined until the 1920s and the lack of an earlier
                  equivalent suggests what we call “ghost-writing” had yet to be codified in taxonomies
                  of authorship.

               <!--anchor--></a><p>Although no surviving records detail what Wordsworth was to write or his agreed-upon
               deadlines and fees, he clearly had two basic assignments. First, he was to compose
               a general survey of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire, the three Lakeland counties
               featured in Wilkinson’s sketches. For this part of the letterpress, he was under no
               obligation to reference specific drawings, which meant he could compose it while Wilkinson’s
               sketches were being engraved. Then, once proofs of the prints were available, his
               second task would be providing “appropriate Letter-press Descriptions” of the specific
               scenes the artist had depicted. Presumably, what Wilkinson had in mind—and what Wordsworth
               ultimately failed to deliver—were the brief notes, which could be as short as a sentence
               or as long as several paragraphs, that were increasingly desired by purchasers wishing
               to learn more about the distinctive qualities or histories of the series’ featured
               sites. Such descriptions were fast becoming the norm in Ackermann sets, and, tellingly,
               Wilkinson’s one later series, <em>The Architectural Remains of the Ancient Town and Borough of Thetford</em> (1822), featured conventional examples of the genre (fig. 7).

               <p>Unsurprisingly, Wordsworth’s enthusiasm and output corresponded directly to the relative
                  independence these particular tasks afforded. After likely accepting Wilkinson’s commission
                  sometime in the latter half of June 1809, he made little headway over a summer spent
                  entertaining house guests. As Dorothy Wordsworth informed De Quincey on 1 August,
                  William had “not done anything of late, indeed we have had so much company that it
                  was scarcely possible for him to feel sufficiently independent to devote himself to
                  composition.”

                  </div> Yet, once their visitors departed, Wordsworth dove into the project with considerable
                  energy. Writing her friend Catherine Clarkson on 18 November, Dorothy reports that
                  Sara Hutchinson—the sister of William's wife, Mary, and a current member of the household—was
                  “transcribing the introduction to a collection of prints to be published by Mr. Wilkinson
                  of Thetford (of which I believe you know the history as your husband’s name is down
                  among those of the subscribers).” Although William had “only finished the general
                  introduction, being unable to do the rest till he has seen the prints,” Dorothy was
                  already prepared to anoint this earliest version of the <em>Guide</em> “the only regular and I may say <em>scientific</em> account of the present and past state and appearance of the country that has yet appeared.”

            <p>Less surprising than her enthusiastic appraisal is Dorothy’s uncharacteristically
               understated report of her brother having thus far “only” finished his introduction.
               By any objective standard, William set a remarkably brisk pace in drafting an 18,000-word,
               meticulously researched, and vividly rendered section that, when set in type, became
               the 34-page “Introduction” serialized over the first eight months of 1810 (pp. 1–34
               of the <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/guide_lakes/1810-letterpress-scans">letterpress</a> and paras. 1–56 of <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.1810.html">our transcription</a>). This initial task completed, however, his pace slowed to a crawl. He would ultimately
               need the entire year between November 1809 and November 1810 to supply the “descriptions”
               that, once set in type, filled a mere twelve pages (pp. 35–46 / para. 57–75). Part
               of the problem, as Dorothy implied in November 1809, was that the momentum he established
               in completing the introduction was lost while awaiting the prints he was expected
               to describe.

               <p>The spotty archival record chronicles the mounting frustrations that soured Wordsworth
                  and Wilkinson’s relationship over the course of 1810. Whereas Dorothy had signaled
                  their enduring enthusiasm for the project the previous November, the next surviving
                  mention of <em>Select Views</em>, in William’s 10 May 1810 letter to Lady Margaret Beaumont (<a class="link_ref" href="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.letters.html#letter6">letter 6</a>), reveals how repugnant the task had become. Addressing a correspondent who, while
                  a close friend, outranked him both in society and the world of visual arts, Wordsworth
                  preemptively—and gracelessly—distances his letterpress from Wilkinson’s “drawings,
                  or Etchings, or whatever they may be called.” He fully expects that, upon perusing
                  Wilkinson’s “intolerable” sketches, Lady Beaumont and her artist husband, Sir George,
                  “will receive from them that sort of disgust which I do from bad Poetry, a disgust
                  which can never be felt in its full strength, but by those who are practised in an
                  art, as well as Amateurs of it.”

               <p>While no extant letters offer Wilkinson’s side of the story, the collaboration likely
                  left him similarly exasperated. Various manuscript fragments show that the slapdash
                  “descriptions” Wordsworth submitted during the first half of 1810 made no concerted
                  effort to align with Wilkinson’s sketches. Worse, Wordsworth assumed a peremptory
                  tone toward his putative employer, scrawling at the top of one manuscript, “Herewith
                  is matter for two more numbers; I shall send for two additional ones in a couple of
                  days. – You will probably judge best to print matter for two numbers with each month
                  as [you] have only six months before you, and your numbers are 12.” Wilkinson unsurprisingly
                  balked at printing whatever scraps Wordsworth sent him, instructing the writer to
                  condense and combine material originally submitted as “Section 2: On the best approach
                  to the Lakes, &amp;c.” and “Section 3d: Donnerdale continued &amp;c. &amp;c.”

                  II” until mid-November. Writing Catherine Clarkson on 12 November 1810, Dorothy reports
                  that “not being permitted to follow his own course” had proven so “irksome” to William
                  that he had “employed me to compose a description or two for the finishing of his
                  work for Wilkinson.” With trademark self-deprecation, she notes, “I daresay you will

                  recalcitrance and procrastination. After apparently receiving no new material from
                  the writer in October, they shipped the penultimate November number without any letterpress
                  pages. And, with Dorothy still dashing off descriptions in mid-November, they may
                  well have anticipated needing to write the concluding paragraphs of “Section II” themselves
                  in order to send some semblance of a completed letterpress with the final installment
                  due to ship by month’s end.

                  Wordsworth’s copy of <em>Select Views</em> soon thereafter, Wilkinson signed himself the poet’s “faithful, and Obliged Friend”
                  (fig. 8). The delivery of this presentation copy is the last known interaction of
                  any sort between the two. That, a decade later, members of Wordsworth’s household
                  felt at least some lingering animus is suggested by Sara Hutchinson’s 1820 jibe that
                  “Wm’s Preface to Wilkinson’s [series was] the only part of the Publication worth any
                  thing” (<a class="link_ref" href="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.letters.html#letter11">letter 11</a>).

                  </div> Obviously not sharing this view, Wilkinson commissioned limited-run editions of <em>Select Views</em> in 1817 and 1821, announcing the latter in advertisements for his second, and final,
                  published series of drawings, <em>The Architectural Remains of the Ancient Town and Borough of Thetford</em>.

                           he republished the letterpress exactly as it had appeared in 1810 (i.e., no revisions,
                           same font and page layout, identical pagination). For details on the 1817 reissue,
                           see Reed, A Bibliography, A10. The 1821 Select Views, a copy of which is held by the
                           Wordsworth Trust, was advertised as follows in the Norfolk Chronicle for 18 Aug. 1821:
                           “A limited number of sets of the Select Views in Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire
                           from Drawings by the Rev. Joseph Wilkinson, revised and corrected from the Original…</span></div>
                  </div> If, as seems likely, Wilkinson chose neither to inform nor consult the poet about
                  these reissues, he apparently wasn’t alone in foregoing such courtesies. For, while
                  Dorothy conceded in November 1809 that any repurposing of her brother’s texts would
                  need to wait until <em>Select Views</em> had had “its fair run,” there is no evidence of Wordsworth’s either securing permission
                  to republish the material copyrighted under Wilkinson’s name or notifying him of the
                  three revisions of the <em>Select Views</em> letterpress he published before the artist’s 1831 death.

               <p>As our edition’s <a class="link_ref" href="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.paralleltext.pdf">parallel-text chart</a> illustrates, the quarter-century Wordsworth ultimately spent revising the <em>Guide</em> off and on rendered an 1835 text that is markedly different from the 1810 original.
                  Of the fifth edition’s 139 paragraphs, only 56 originated in <em>Select Views</em>, and most of these were meaningfully altered in intervening editions. Yet, perhaps
                  the most dramatic changes to the <em>Guide</em> between 1810 and 1835 were external rather than internal. The earliest readers of
                  Wordsworth’s essay would have encountered it in heavy tomes that gathered and bound
                  all twelve installments of the folio-sized engravings and letterpress pages from Wilkinson’s
                  series.

                           at the agent bookshop or in the family library until all numbers had appeared. This
                           helps explain the relative uniformity of surviving copies, which generally include
                           all 48 engravings and follow the order prescribed on Wilkinson’s contents page (which
                           shipped with the final number). For details on binding practices during this era,

                  </div> When opened and laid flat, a bound copy of <em>Select Views</em> measures approximately 20” x 27.25” (508 x 692mm), or roughly the size of the average
                  desk’s working surface. Factor in its 7.5-pound (3.4 kg) weight, and it is difficult
                  to imagine many readers perusing Wordsworth’s letterpress while walking the fells
                  or traveling in cramped stagecoaches to the Lakes. Once emancipated from <em>Select Views</em>, however, Wordsworth’s essay would have been read and used in myriad new contexts.
                  As illustrated below in figure 9, the books in which the earliest versions of the <em>Guide</em> appeared gradually shrunk from the unwieldy Wilkinson folio of 1810, to the comparatively
                  portable <em>River Duddon</em> octavo of 1820, and finally to the pocket-sized duodecimo of 1822 (the basic size
                  retained for the 1823 and 1835 editions). And, at 7 ounces (203 g), the 1835 edition
                  weighed a full 7 pounds less than bound copies of <em>Select Views</em>.

                  to his own “Guide to the Lakes,” eleven years would elapse before he would publish
                  an abridged and revised version under his own name as the “annex” to his 1820 sonnet

                           essays known today as the 
                           “Unpublished Tour”
                           and 
                           “The Sublime and the Beautiful.”
                           He left these pieces unfinished, however, when his 1812 pension from Lord Lonsdale
                           and 1813 appointment as Distributor of Stamps gave him the financial freedom to return
                           to poetry. Core ideas from both essays would inform later versions of the Guide. See
                           Gill, Life, 295–96 and the version of both essays in Vol. 2 of Owen and Smyser’s Prose

                  </div> Unconcerned with leaving his copy of the 1810 letterpress pristine, Wordsworth hand-wrote
                  many of his revisions directly into the bound set he had received from Wilkinson (fig.
                  10).

                           Wordsworth was “very probably back at work on a guide again, motivated by financial
                           objectives, around November 1812” (Middle Years, 673–75).</span></div>
                  </div> Besides cutting several lengthy passages and expunging all references to Wilkinson
                  and his etchings, Wordsworth retitled his essay “A Topographical Description of the
                  Country of the Lakes in the North of England,” combined “Section I” and “Section II”
                  from the first edition, and added new passages on the gracefulness and beauty of the
                  Lakes, travelers’ typical reactions to the region’s mountains, and the damage “improvers”
                  had recently inflicted upon estates at Derwentwater and Windermere (fig. 11).

                  </div> He also appended a prefatory note justifying the essay’s publication in <em>The River Duddon</em> volume on the grounds of its “having been written in the same spirit” as his poems
                  and “a belief that it [would] materially illustrate” his verses. Similar encouragement
                  to read his “Topographical Description” of the Lakes in tandem with his verse appears
                  in the essay itself, which routinely illustrates key points with quotations from Wordsworth’s
                  poetry.

                  third edition, titled <em>A Description of the Scenery in the North of England</em>, appeared in June 1822 as a portable octavo that was widely advertised and reasonably
                  priced at 5s. 6d. New traveler-friendly features included a fold-out map, notes on
                  the climate, “Directions and Information for the Tourist,” and an account of an ascent
                  up Scafell Pike that, while written by Dorothy, appears as if by her brother. Wordsworth
                  also added a section comparing his native region’s mountains and the Alps as part
                  of a larger effort to “reconcile a Briton to the scenery of his own country, though

               <p>Rather than simply reissuing the successful 1822 edition, Wordsworth chose yet again
                  to revise and expand his text for the next edition that appeared in June 1823. Retaining
                  his title from 1822, this fourth edition added 5,400 words of content, including further
                  comparisons of the Lake District and the Alps and new passages on water birds, weather
                  patterns, and the distinctive glories of the four seasons in the Lakes. By far the
                  longest addition, however, was another of Dorothy’s unpublished travel accounts, this
                  one chronicling the siblings’ 1805 excursion to Ullswater. Adding yet another chapter
                  to the history of ghost-writing in the <em>Guide</em>, Wordsworth appended this new account to the Scafell Pike narrative he had borrowed
                  from Dorothy in 1822 and presented both as his own work. Even with these supplemental
                  features, the thousand-copy print run for the 1823 edition proved overly optimistic.
                  With hundreds of copies on hand after the initial sales wave, Wordsworth’s publisher,
                  Longman, would end up advertising this as a “New Edition” of Wordsworth’s guidebook
                  near the beginning of every summer travel season between 1823 and 1833 (fig. 13).

               <p>After finally clearing out his stock of the 1823 edition in 1835, Longman understandably

                           113 in 1824, and 169 in 1825. Excepting 1829, when 120 copies sold, the publisher
                           moved between 33 and 85 per year between 1826 and 1835. The unusual interest in the
                           Guide well after its release speaks, in part, to its perceived utility. Most of Wordsworth’s
                           poetry collections sold several hundred copies in the first two years but fewer than
                           ten copies per year thereafter. See Owen, 
                           “Cost, Sales, and Profits,”

                  </div> The now 65-year-old Wordsworth, however, was keen on one last revision of his “Little
                  Book on the Lakes” and sensed that, partly owing to his growing public stature as
                  a poet, an updated edition would find an audience. Hudson and Nicholson, regional
                  publishers based in nearby Kendal, shared this view and in short order signed on to
                  replace Longman for the fifth edition. Explicitly targeting the Lake District traveler,
                  the new publishers rechristened the book <em>A Guide through the District of the Lakes in the North of England</em> and advertised its 25 July 1835 release exclusively in local newspapers (figs. 14
                  and 15).

                           Wordsworth’s new publishers set aside a minuscule £3.14 for advertising the fifth
                           edition. Hudson reported to Wordsworth having advertised the new edition in six small-town
                           Cumbrian newspapers: the Carlisle Journal, Carlisle Patriot, Kendal Gazette, Kendal
                           Mercury, Whitehaven Pacquet, and Whitehaven Herald (Wordsworth Trust MS. WLMS 6/9/1).

                  </div> For his part, Wordsworth added ten new paragraphs to the beginning of his “Directions
                  and Information for the Tourist” and moved this section from the back of the book
                  to the front. Lest the intent of such alterations be lost on its imagined audience,
                  Hudson and Nicholson’s ads highlighted how, “in a concise style,” Wordsworth had laid
                  out “the best and most convenient order of visiting the Lakes.” Better yet, “An Itinerary
                  of Excursions has been added by the Publishers, which will be found of great advantage
                  to Tourists.”

               <p>As might be expected, rebranding the <em>Guide</em> as a locally manufactured and distributed product designed for provincial customers
                  had a chilling effect on sales in the metropolis. Having stayed on as the new edition’s
                  London distributor, Longman sold a mere 164 copies between 1835 and 1843. Within the
                  Lake District, however, the fifth edition enjoyed robust sales. Enclosing a royalty
                  check for £29.17.10, Hudson reported to Wordsworth that, as of 27 September 1838,
                  only 433 of the 1,500 copies printed in 1835 remained unsold. Imagining unflagging
                  interest in the years ahead, the publisher suggested, “We should be happy to consult
                  with you sometime when we are at Ambleside on the expediency of having a new &amp; more
                  correct map of the Lake District, and also of extending the directions to Tourists

               <p>Content at last to leave his essay be, Wordsworth demurred on Hudson’s request for
                  another revision. He would, however, assist the publishers with “Hudson’s <em>Guide</em>,” the 1842 edition that paired his and Adam Sedgwick’s studies of the Lakes. Together,
                  this new edition and the tourist-friendly version of 1835 brought into sharp relief
                  the <em>Guide</em>’s previously underappreciated engagement with earlier landmarks of Lake District
                  travel writing. While people had long lived and labored in the region, before the
                  mid-eighteenth century the lakes and mountains of England’s northwest attracted few
                  leisure travelers. In fact, the topography of the Lake District struck many as more
                  forbidding than inviting. Daniel Defoe, writing in the 1720s, claimed that the region
                  was “eminent only for being the wildest, most barren and frightful of any that I have
                  passed over in England.”

                  </div> By the time Wordsworth reached adulthood, however, his native Lake District had become
                  one of the most popular landscape subjects for writers and artists in the British
                  Isles and increasingly a destination for tourists. The Wordsworths and other locals
                  without an economic stake in the annual summer influx began derisively referring to
                  these travelers as “Lakers.” At the close of one especially heavy tourism season,
                  an exhausted Dorothy Wordsworth wrote on 18 October 1825, “I think we had the last
                  of our Lakers on Sunday.”

                           for botany. In 1805, Windermere resident Richard Watson, Bishop of Llandaff, explained
                           to a friend that “Lakers” was “the denomination by which we distinguish those who
                           come to see our country.” More specifically, he suggested, it was reserved for “idle
                           persons who love laking” (Anecdotes of the Life of Richard Watson, 2 vols. [London:

                  unspoiled because earlier generations found it resistant to large-scale cultivation,
                  difficult to traverse, and prone to unpleasant weather. It was not until modernity
                  arrived, with its sprawling populations and rapid transportation networks, that Britons
                  began to value “wilderness” for its contrasting spiritual resources.

                           the landscape meant holding on to and enhancing its character as produced by traditional
                           ways of life and the mediating power of taste. Throughout the Guide, readers find

                  </div> In old age, Wordsworth recalled a Keswick landlady of his youth who lamented, “Bless

                  a thing neamed!”

                  </div> This cult of picturesque scenery that so flummoxed his landlady had become firmly
                  entrenched by the late 1700s. Born into a world newly alive to natural scenery, Wordsworth
                  emerged at an ideal moment for capturing nature’s glories in prose and verse. By 1825,
                  he had come claim that his “wish” in writing the <em>Guide</em> was “to teach the <em>Touring World</em>, which is become very numerous, to look thro’ the clear eye of the Understanding
                  as well as thro’ the hazy one of vague Sensibility.”

            <p>Various imperatives drove the popularization of scenic terrains like those found among
               the lakes and fells of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire. One was national:
               the so-called “discovery of Britain” reflected a desire to domesticate the continental
               Grand Tour, the rite of passage that functioned as the culmination of a gentleman’s
               education. The growth of home tourism in the eighteenth century was accelerated both
               by economic constraints and European wars. Turning their energies inward, then, by
               necessity as well as inclination, British tourists, artists, and travel writers self-consciously
               went about demarcating their own nation’s classic ground, including the lesser-known
               but increasingly romanticized landscapes of Northern England, Scotland, and Wales.
            </p>
            <p>Wordsworth thus participated in a broader cultural phenomenon when comparing the Lakeland
               fells to the Alps and desiring to “reconcile a Briton to the scenery of his own country”
               (<a class="link_ref" href="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.1835.html#para106">para. 106</a>). While this nativizing project took on fresh urgency during the Revolutionary and
               Napoleonic Wars, it was a movement long in the making. The early promotion of British
               landscape had its paradoxical aspects—for instance, drawing on continental codes of
               art to celebrate domestic beauties. Yet it set the stage for the time when tourists
               would hunger to range over British territory defined as heritage landscape, sped along
               by expanding economic opportunity, leisure, and transportation improvements. It is
               no wonder that most historians of British travel date the birth of modern tourism
               to roughly 1750, as this moment witnessed not only the birth of Lake District literature
               but also the earliest stirrings of the cult of the picturesque. By the dawn of the
               Romantic period, conditions were firmly in place for a boom in British home tourism.

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Wordsworth both reflects and capitalizes on these trends in the <em>Guide</em>. Repeatedly noting changes from “within the last sixty years,” he defines a period

                           1770, his birth year, the point of departure. This blurring of regional history and
                           his own lifespan connected the Guide and the landscape it celebrates to the biographical
                           myth underlying Wordsworth’s poetic project (see Gill, Life, 285).</span></div>

                  It also encouraged more affluent people to move to or purchase second homes in the
                  region. Arguably, Wordsworth himself chose to settle in the heart of the Lake District
                  not only because it was his childhood home and the repository of personal memories
                  but also because it was rich aesthetic territory. Now, in both the <em>Guide</em> and his poetry, he was taking stock of the changes that had occurred in his native
                  region, celebrating some but more often sounding defensive and elegiac notes. While
                  singing the beauties of a place, he also aimed to define and protect it.

               <p>Despite enduring myths surrounding Wordsworth and his fellow poets’ “discovery” of

                  </div> By the late eighteenth century, works by these and other writers were commonly read,
                  toted about, and recycled (that is, cited, imitated, or plagiarized outright). Moreover,
                  Lake Country tours were fast becoming the target of satires, as in James Plumptre’s <em>The Lakers</em> (1798) and William Combe and Thomas Rowlandson’s <em>The Tour of Dr. Syntax in Search of the Picturesque</em> (1809–1811) (fig. 16).

                  region as a miniature version of the Alps, and countless commentaries on the use of
                  color and form in landscapes.

               <p>The first influential promoters of the region’s scenery were visual artists, but just
                  behind them came the writers who established foundations for literature on the region.
                  One was John Dalton of Queen’s College, Oxford, who published <em>A Descriptive Poem Addressed to Two Young Ladies at Their Return from Viewing the
                     Mines Near Whitehaven</em> in 1755; another was John Brown of St John’s, Cambridge, whose glowing letter on the
                  Vale of Keswick (written in the early 1750s but first published in 1767) described
                  the area’s scenery in terms of “the united powers of Claude, Salvator, and Poussin”
                  and attracted many aspiring artists and scenery-hounds.

               <p>Even before Wordsworth’s birth, Brown’s letter had found its way into the hands of
                  Thomas Gray and convinced the famous poet to turn tourist. Gray, best known for his 
                  “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard”
                   (1751), made his tour of the Lakes in 1769, two years before his eventual death and
                  fifteen months before Wordsworth’s birth. Having left a sick traveling companion behind,
                  he kept a careful journal that was first printed in William Mason’s <em>The Poems of Mr. Gray</em> (1775). Gray’s journal fully entered the canon of Lakeland literature, however, when
                  republished as an addendum to the second edition of Thomas West’s popular <em>Guide to the Lakes</em> (1780). Though Gray’s account was often parodied for such superheated descriptions
                  as that of the “Jaws of Borrowdale,” Wordsworth’s <em>Guide</em> praises its prevailing “distinctness and unaffected simplicity” (<a class="link_ref" href="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.1835.html#para73">para. 73</a>).

                           admitted that Gray’s journal offered little of what readers might call “fine writing”
                           but insisted that those who prized trustworthy description and “elegant simplicity
                           of narrative” would consider it a welcome companion to their travels (in West, A Guide
                           to the Lakes, 2nd ed. [London: Richardson and Urquhart, 1780], 199).</span></div>
                  </div> Notwithstanding his earlier critiques of Gray’s poetic diction in the 
                  “Preface to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>,”
                   Wordsworth found in him a kindred spirit, a poet of an earlier generation exploring
                  places he now knew and loved. Gray’s journal contained several passages that Wordsworth
                  would especially approve, such as when he calls Grasmere Vale, Wordsworth’s future
                  home, “a little unexpected paradise.”

                  </div> Wordsworth also rightly saw Gray’s journal as a major impetus for the growth of Lakeland
                  tourism, attributing its sway in part to “the pensive interest with which the human
                  mind is ever disposed to listen to the farewell words of genius” (<a class="link_ref" href="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.1835.html#para73">para. 73</a>).

            </div>
            <p>Alongside Gray, the most important figures in the background of Wordsworth’s <em>Guide</em> were West and the Reverend William Gilpin. Although unpublished until 1786, Gilpin’s
               <em>Observations Relative Chiefly to Picturesque Beauty</em> had circulated broadly in manuscript since 1772 and gained significant influence.
               More instruction manual than tour guide, Gilpin’s treatise served as a touchstone
               for Wordsworth in the <em>Guide</em> and elsewhere, clearly informing his theories of and vocabulary for describing the
               picturesque, though Wordsworth resisted Gilpin’s painterly perspective. Wordsworth’s
               most consistent interlocutor in his essay on the Lakes, however, is West, whose own
               <em>A Guide to the Lakes</em> (1778) was the undisputed classic on the subject. Before writing his guidebook, West
               had already established himself as an authority on the region with <em>The Antiquities of Furness</em> (1774), and, recognizing that Lake tourism was accelerating, he set out to fill a
               need. Just how successful West’s <em>Guide</em> had proven in this aim is evidenced by its going into an eleventh edition in 1821,
               the year before Wordsworth’s essay first appeared in a stand-alone volume.
            </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Sensibly organized, clear, detailed, and engaging throughout, West’s catalog of the
                  wonders of the Lake District quickly won admirers. Wordsworth frequently alludes to
                  it approvingly in his <em>Guide</em>, noting at one point how this earlier “Guide to the Lakes has been eminently serviceable
                  to the Tourist for nearly 50 years” (<a class="link_ref" href="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.1835.html#para116">para. 116</a>). The first few pages of West’s book indicate its character. Its epigraph, taken
                  from Milton’s description of Eden, announces a treatise on “A happy rural seat of
                  various views,” and such “views” of England’s Northern Arcadia would quickly emerge
                  as the work’s main emphasis. Perhaps most famously, West recommends a series of viewing
                  stations best suited to use of a “landscape mirrors,” or the “Claude glasses” popular
                  with Gray and other educated travelers whose expectations had been shaped by landscape
                  art (fig. 17).

The glass could frame and tint the landscape so that it resembled one of Claude’s paintings. (Courtesy: Victoria and Albert Museum, London)" class="graphic"/></figure>
            <p>After its author’s 1779 death, West’s <em>Guide</em> gradually morphed into an anthology of Lake District writing in the second (1780)
               and third (1784) editions overseen by William Cockin (figs. 18 and 19). Filling some
               hundred pages of the three hundred-page book, Cockin’s “Addenda” offered a chronologically
               organized survey of writing on the Lakes since the 1750s. The collection as a whole
               treated literary descriptions, especially poems, as fundamental aides to appreciating
               the region’s landscapes, inspiring Wordsworth and a host of others to take up the
               rhapsodic pen themselves. In the wake of these expanded editions of West’s <em>Guide</em>, composing a suitable panegyric became an important aspect of travel to the Lakes
               and writing verse became a cognate to amateur sketching.

            <p>West and his early readers therefore launched a process that the Lake Poets, especially
               Wordsworth, would complete, converting the Lake District into a poetic landscape.
               By framing the region as a series of poems and pictures and establishing codes for
               admiring such pictures, West and his contemporaries set patterns that Lake District
               tourism still follows in many respects, though catering now to travelers with digital
               cameras. Nearly 250 years after West, tourists may still visit some of his viewing
               “stations,” including most famously Claife Station on the western shore of Windermere
               (fig. 20).

            </header>
            <p>Clearly, then, Wordsworth did not write in a vacuum, as his essay on the Lakes was
               highly informed by earlier guides. Nonetheless, it was novel in several respects.
               Wordsworth’s <em>Guide</em> embraced the creed that animated his verses, broadcasting his ideals in editions
               increasingly geared toward the general reader who might never have taken to his poetry.
               As witnessed in our <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.annotated_bib.html">annotated bibliography</a>, commentators on the <em>Guide</em> have long emphasized its uniquely “Wordsworthian” traits. Whereas earlier guidebooks
               had typically assumed the tourist’s point of view, Wordsworth’s convinces us its author
               has walked all of the region’s paths in all sorts of weather. He belongs to the place
               almost as much as do the trees, rocks, lichens, and waterfalls. Characteristically,
               he blends a native’s matter-of-factness with a sense of persistent wonder and dignified
               reverence.
            </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Wordsworth also goes beyond the conventional practice of travel handbooks in his range
                  of arguments. As Ian Ousby suggests, the <em>Guide</em> “makes most [earlier travel books] seem ‘two-dimensional’ by its larger, more rounded
                  approach to its subject, treating landscape not as a special effect to be sought out
                  and appreciated in isolation but connecting it to the region’s geology, history, and
                  human culture.”

                  </div> Upon completing the 
                  “Introduction”
                   to <em>Select Views</em>, Wordsworth explained to Lady Beaumont on 10 May 1810 that he aspired to “give a
                  model of the manner in which topographical descriptions ought to be executed . . .
                  by evolving truly and distinctly one appearance from another” (<a class="link_ref" href="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.letters.html#letter6">letter 6</a>).

                  </div> Honoring this original intent, all iterations of the <em>Guide</em> insist that travelers experience the Lake District as it unfolds itself gradually
                  to the pedestrian. Against the tradition of viewing the region merely as a series
                  of discrete viewing stations, Wordsworth presents it as a whole that takes its charms
                  from interconnection and gradual transition, both physical and temporal. The Lake
                  District may offer no single feature superior to, say, a high peak in the Alps, but
                  as a compact <em>whole</em>, it compares favorably with any terrain in the world. Embodying Coleridge’s concept
                  of beauty as “multeity in unity,” the region is a poem in which the parts take their
                  meaning from the overall scheme. This understanding has ecological significance. All
                  aspects of Lake Country life—aesthetic, meteorological, social, agricultural, geological,
                  biological—are taken to be interrelated.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>Even in radically repurposing what began as the prose supplement to an esoteric art
               series into a portable traveler’s companion, Wordsworth never saw himself writing
               a mere guidebook. Straightaway in the 1835 edition he begrudges the “humble and tedious
               task” of providing directions for tourists, aspiring instead to influence “the <em>Minds</em> of Persons of taste, and a feeling for Landscape,” sensitive souls prepared to watch
               and receive with uncommon attention (<a class="link_ref" href="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.1835.html#para1">para. 1</a>). Tellingly, the word “guide” never appeared in the work’s title until it became
               important to Hudson and Nicholson’s marketing of the fifth edition. <em>Description</em>, Wordsworth’s chosen label for the second, third, and fourth editions, was in ways
               more accurate, though the <em>Guide</em> never confines its task to merely “describing” the region.
            </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Another feature distinguishing Wordsworth’s essay from its forerunners is the pioneering
                  case it makes for preserving the ecological, aesthetic, and social health of the Lake
                  District. Even while promoting the region’s charms, it conveys a fear that newcomers
                  may love the region to death. As noted above, Wordsworth writes as a Lake District
                  local, but he also writes <em>to</em> locals—especially to wealthy landowners who have recently arrived. The title page
                  of the 1835 edition advertises this as a book “for the use of Tourists and Residents,”
                  and all stand-alone versions included the bluntly subtitled section on “Changes, and
                  Rules of Taste for Preventing their Bad Effects.” Whether descanting on the ideal
                  color for homes, the traditional shape of vernacular chimneys, or the sensible placement
                  of trees, Wordsworth often takes a view that transcends the limits of private property.
                  He argues that, in a special moral sense, the countryside belongs to everyone, regardless
                  of who might legally own a particular corner of it. Most famously, his pronouncement
                  that the Lake District should be regarded as “a sort of national property, in which
                  every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy”

               <p>In gradually reworking and repurposing his <em>Guide</em>, Wordsworth came to consider it less an autonomous work than part of his larger literary
                  and philosophical project. Where other topographical writers might refer to a painting,
                  Wordsworth usually quotes poetry, not infrequently his own.

                  most evocative language at hand, whether in the form of a lyric, a passage from the <em>Excursion</em>, or a few lines from such unpublished works as “Home at Grasmere” or <em>The Prelude</em>. In so doing, Wordsworth insists that poetry is an authoritative mode of description.
                  His quotations become both illustrations and occasions for heightened focus. Sometimes
                  they also model emotional reactions, encouraging readers to translate the writer’s
                  observations into the realms of personal sensation and reflection.

               <p>Within the larger history of travel writing, the <em>Guide</em> also expands the trend of blending poetry with topographical prose. By Victorian times,
                  this potent combination would not only make reading poetry essential to travelers’
                  landscape explorations but would also produce a thoroughly literary geography, converting
                  the Lake District into the “Wordsworthshire” of literary tourists.

                  terrain he celebrated became inseparable in the public imagination. The increasing
                  popularity of Wordsworth’s poetry from the 1820s through the 1840s mirrored, and probably
                  owed something to, the growing accessibility of the Lake District as tourist terrain.
                  Meanwhile, this tourism, abetted by marketing savvy on the poet’s and his publishers’
                  parts, helped consolidate Wordsworth’s Victorian authorial persona.

                  ample cause for gratitude that Joseph Wilkinson turned up in the spring of 1809 with
                  an offer that at last persuaded Wordsworth to overcome his anxieties about doing justice
                  to “a theme so boundless and sublime as this beautiful region” (<a class="link_ref" href="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.letters.html#letter2">letter 2</a>).

                  in the <em>Guide</em> when the literature of knowledge modulates into the literature of power: striking
                  metaphors; accounts of the "magical" effects of reflection, light and mist; expeditions
                  into the clouds; and even excursions back in time. Other passages dwell on the small
                  and often overlooked—lichens, wildflowers, ferns, gravel. Such descriptions capture
                  in prose the “poetry of nature” for which Wordsworth remains beloved. In short, the
                  book promotes "imagination," defined by Wordsworth in his note to 
                  “The Thorn”
                   as “the faculty which produces impressive effects out of simple elements.”

               <p>Of course, the history of the <em>Guide</em>’s influence hardly ends with the editions published during his lifetime. Victorian
                  guidebooks commonly referenced it, so that many of its principles, absorbed and ultimately
                  taken for granted, came to affect readers indirectly. Lake District tourism and its
                  associated literature continued to grow rapidly after the poet’s death, encouraged
                  by improved transportation to the gateway towns, the emergence of photography, and
                  the unflagging enthusiasm of many writers, walkers, tour promoters, artists, and conservationists,
                  notable Wordsworthians among them. While Wordsworth would have been pleased by the
                  expansion of his reputation and influence, he likely would have felt some discomfort
                  about the commercialization of “Wordsworth Country.” Late in his life, he had famously
                  protested the construction of the Kendal and Windermere Railway, fearing that mass
                  tourism would degrade the Lake District’s “character of seclusion and retirement.”

               <p>Yet, despite the irony of a man so skeptical of tourism writing a guidebook, Wordsworth
                  had a lifelong passion for introducing others to the beauties of his native region
                  and a growing awareness of how his works helped produce the demand for tourist infrastructure.
                  While his second railway letter reminded the coming hordes that “there are temples
                  of Nature, temples built by the Almighty, which have . . . claim to be left unviolated,”
                  he never expected or desired to keep the Lakes to himself.

                  to accept the crowds at Windermere along with his fan mail and the pilgrims finding
                  their way to Rydal Mount—all natural consequences of an appreciative readership. <em>The Guide</em> thus leaves us with a paradox, and it may be said to have come up short in some of
                  its rhetorical aims. Still, signs of the impact of Wordsworth’s taste-shaping efforts,
                  his conservation ethic, and his love of nature abound even now in the Lake District
                  and beyond.

               in Owen and Smyser, <em>Prose Works</em> (2:124) and Reed, <em>Middle Years</em> (p. 671). Two details suggest this undated letter was written in early June 1809.
               First, Wilkinson reports having read “with much pleasure &amp; interest” the first issue
               of Coleridge’s <em>The Friend</em>, which appeared on 1 June 1809. Second, in a separate letter dated 10 June 1809,
               Wordsworth conveys to the publisher of <em>The Friend</em> names and addresses for four new subscribers that Wilkinson had forwarded in his
               letter (<em>Letters</em>, 8: 17–18). In early June, Coleridge was away visiting a friend near Penrith, and
               he wouldn’t return to Grasmere until the 13th. It therefore appears Wordsworth opened
               Wilkinson’s letter in his housemate’s absence, as he would not have otherwise had
               the subscriber details he forwarded prior to Coleridge’s return. For Coleridge’s whereabouts

               in Sara Hutchinson’s hand, with Wordsworth’s note to Wilkinson (“Herewith is matter
               for two more numbers . . . ”) superimposed over the header for “Section 2.” In his
               1993 supplement to the Wordsworths’ <em>Letters</em>, Alan G. Hill tentatively dates William’s note on DCMS 68.3A to early March 1810,
               since his amanuensis, Sara Hutchinson, moved to her brother’s home in Wales in mid-March.
               Yet, in mentioning that Wilkinson had “only six months before you,” Wordsworth presumably
               meant that, while six of the twelve monthly instalments (i.e., Jan.–June) had shipped,
               six (i.e., July–Dec.) remained. If this reading is correct, he sent his manuscript
               and the inscribed note to Wilkinson sometime between late May (when the June installment
               was in print) and mid-June (before July’s was complete). This would confirm Hill’s
               alternate theory that Hutchinson copied the manuscript before leaving in mid-March

               same font and page layout, identical pagination). For details on the 1817 reissue,
               see Reed, <em>A Bibliography</em>, A10. The 1821 <em>Select Views</em>, a copy of which is held by the Wordsworth Trust, was advertised as follows in the
               <em>Norfolk Chronicle</em> for 18 Aug. 1821: “A limited number of sets of the Select Views in Cumberland, Westmoreland,
               and Lancashire from Drawings by the Rev. Joseph Wilkinson, revised and corrected from

               This helps explain the relative uniformity of surviving copies, which generally include
               all 48 engravings and follow the order prescribed on Wilkinson’s contents page (which
               shipped with the final number). For details on binding practices during this era,

               and 
               “The Sublime and the Beautiful.”
               He left these pieces unfinished, however, when his 1812 pension from Lord Lonsdale
               and 1813 appointment as Distributor of Stamps gave him the financial freedom to return
               to poetry. Core ideas from both essays would inform later versions of the <em>Guide</em>. See Gill, <em>Life</em>, 295–96 and the version of both essays in Vol. 2 of Owen and Smyser’s <em>Prose Works</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note52_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               the publisher moved between 33 and 85 per year between 1826 and 1835. The unusual
               interest in the <em>Guide</em> well after its release speaks, in part, to its perceived utility. Most of Wordsworth’s
               poetry collections sold several hundred copies in the first two years but fewer than
               ten copies per year thereafter. See Owen,

In 1805,
               Windermere resident Richard Watson, Bishop of Llandaff, explained to a friend that
               “<em>Lakers</em>” was “the denomination by which we distinguish those who come to see our country.”

               the landscape meant holding on to and enhancing its character as produced by traditional
               ways of life and the mediating power of taste. Throughout the <em>Guide</em>, readers find significant tension between “nature” and “culture.” Several scholars
               listed in our annotated bibliography have addressed this tension and other complications

               <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>: “During the first year that Mr. Wordsworth and I were neighbours, our conversations
               turned frequently on the two cardinal points of poetry, the power of exciting the
               sympathy of the reader by a faithful adherence to the truth of nature, and the power
               of giving the interest of novelty by the modifying colours of imagination. The sudden
               charm, which accidents of light and shade, which moonlight or sunset diffused over
               a known and familiar landscape, appeared to represent the practicability of combining
               both. These are the poetry of nature” (<em>Biographia Literaria</em>, [London: Rest Penner, 1817], vol. 2, 1). For Wordsworth’s discussion of “imagination”
