                  reflects the diversity of responses the <em>Guide</em> has engendered since its original publication. The style, tenor, and length of the
                  sources below vary greatly. Most items are by professional scholars, but a few are
                  the work of enthusiasts who revel in the pleasures of discovering (or re-discovering)
                  the Lake District through Wordsworth’s eyes. Collectively, these works speak to the
                  significant impact the <em>Guide</em> has had on how we imagine and value the English Lake District.

                  outside research libraries. For readers seeking an inexpensive, portable edition of
                  the <em>Guide</em>, several options exist. At present, the most readily available version is a 2004
                  reprint of Ernest de Sélincourt’s edition (London: Frances Lincoln) with a preface
                  by Stephen Gill.

London: Moxon, 1876. Vol. 2. 215-319. </span></span> 
                     <p class="noCount">In this first attempt to assemble all of Wordsworth’s prose writings, the arrangement
                        is thematic. The text of the 1835 <em>Guide</em> appears in vol. 2, “Aesthetical and Literary” works, under the subcategory of “Descriptive”
                        writing, accompanied by Wordsworth’s letters on the Kendal and Windermere Railway.
                        This edition has no footnotes besides Wordsworth’s own and offers just seven “Notes
                        and Illustrations” at the volume’s end. Essentially, then, it offers only a clean
                        reading text, but it sets a precedent for more thorough scholarly treatments.

                     <p class="noCount">Building on the work of Grosart, Knight produces a chronological edition of Wordsworth’s
                        prose writings. Volume 2 begins with the <em>Guide</em>, for which Knight prefers the earlier title, <em>Description of the Scenery of the Lakes</em>. Using the 1835 edition as his copy text, Knight annotates the work with basic information
                        on the <em>Guide</em>’s textual history and references to relevant passages in Wordsworth’s poetry. As
                        such, Knight’s is the first in a line of scholarly editions that runs through de Sélincourt
                        through Owen and Smyser to the current electronic edition.

                     <p class="noCount">The first scholarly, and the most widely read and reprinted, edition of the twentieth
                        century, De Sélincourt’s version includes the 1835 text, a general introduction, scholarly
                        notes, and appendices. De Sélincourt’s learned and affectionate introduction remains
                        indispensable.

                     <p class="noCount">Still the foremost critical edition of Wordsworth’s prose works, Owen and Smyser’s
                        collection includes a thoroughly annotated version of the 1835 <em>Guide through the District of the Lakes</em> and a variety of related texts, including Wordsworth’s <em>Select Views</em>, his “Unpublished Tour,” his essay on “The Sublime and the Beautiful,” and his 1844
                        letters to the <em>Morning Post</em> protesting the incursion of railways into the Lake District. Owen and Smyser offer
                        extensive commentary on the guidebook’s textual history as well as annotations on
                        the text.

                     <p class="noCount">This attractive edition presents the 1835 text alongside images of the Lake District
                        by such artists as Constable, Gilpin, Rowlandson, and Turner. It also includes historical
                        materials (maps, title page facsimiles, etc.) and photographs that add visual and
                        cultural interest. Bicknell’s introduction reviews the <em>Guide</em>’s textual history and helpfully situates the work within the history of Lake District

                     <p class="noCount">Moorman traces how the <em>Guide</em>, originally conceived as the textual introduction to Wilkinson’s sketches, became
                        a significant enterprise, calling the work the first trumpet blast in what was to

                     <p class="noCount">In this authoritative biography, Gill shows that the <em>Guide</em> was a work long in the making. Though reluctantly begun, it became a project in which
                        Wordsworth was deeply invested, and Gill suggests its aesthetic value has been underappreciated
                        in contemporary scholarship. Gill also suggests an autobiographical component of the
                        <em>Guide</em>, noting how Wordsworth uses his birth year (1770) as the moment at which the Lake
                        District and its culture began quickly deteriorating.

                     <p class="noCount">This bibliography and its companion (below) are invaluable for tracing Wordsworth’s
                        sources. Wu lists in chronological order books read by Wordsworth from childhood until
                        the time of his move to Dove Cottage. Among these are many books referenced in the
                        <em>Guide</em>. Wu shows that Wordsworth’s interest in travel literature dates back at least to
                        his days at Hawkshead School.

                     <p class="noCount">Wu’s second window into Wordsworth’s intellectual development, this volume surveys
                        Wordsworth’s reading during the years that produced much of his greatest writing,

                     <p class="noCount">Barker recounts the genesis of the <em>Guide</em>, exploring Wordsworth’s motivations for taking up the project and outlining the book’s
                        chief rhetorical aims. She also touches on later editions of the <em>Guide </em>and their reception.

                     <p class="noCount">Likely penned by John Wilson, this review begins with a passionate defense of Wordsworth
                        against the attacks of the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>, moves into an admiring survey of the <em>River Duddon </em>sonnets, and ends by noting, “The volume is concluded with a very singular and striking
                        prose description of the County of the Lakes; but of this we must defer our notice
                        till some future opportunity—contenting ourselves, in the meantime, with assuring
                        our readers, that it is by far the best specimen of the prose style of Wordsworth
                        which has ever been given to the world” (213).

                     <p class="noCount">This enthusiastic review of the <em>River Duddon</em> volume concludes with warm praise for the “Topographical Description,” asserting:
                        “It certainly is of value as an illustration of the poems now under our review, but
                        we rate its absolute merit very high. Among many topics of rural beauty, it contains
                        an ingenious illustration of the advantages which winter has over summer in the display
                        of mountainous prospect; a very interestingly picturesque description of the disposition
                        and effect of the cottages in the vales; and more particularly of the gradual formation
                        of woody scenery, by nature and time” (52).

                     <p class="noCount">This generally damning review of Wordsworth’s poetry ends on a conciliatory note,
                        suggesting, “the Tour of the Lakes seems to us to be as topographically useful as
                        it is <em>poetically picturesque</em>” (143).

                     <p class="noCount">In the middle of his review of William Green’s <em>Tourist’s New Guide to the Lakes</em>, Wilson remarks: “Mr. Wordsworth has just published in a neat little five shilling
                        duodecimo, (Longman,) an Essay on the Scenery of the North of England. It is, as might
                        have been anticipated, full of fine feeling and fine philosophy. He analizes the country,
                        and shews all the sources of the pleasure which it is peculiarly fitted to yield the
                        enlightened and thoughtful mind. But after all, the best book to read (we are not
                        now speaking of Guides) before, during, and after a Tour of the Lakes, is <span class="smcaps">The Lyrical Ballads</span>” (87).

                        with nine spokes.” When Tyson’s account reminds one of the listeners of Wordsworth’s
                        use of the same analogy in “Section First” of the <em>Guide</em>, Briggs insinuates that the poet has stolen it from the “old dalelander.”

                        excerpts several of the <em>Guide</em>’s remarks on the larch tree. Kent muses that Wordsworth “seems to have had a strange
                        dislike to this fine tree” (208) and that the larch is “to be pitied in having, for
                        its enemy, a pen so powerful” (209).

                     <p class="noCount">In the midst of this rambling essay on British cottages, Wilson inserts a few remarks
                        on the <em>Guide</em>. “Instead of a guide,” he writes, Wordsworth “presented the world with a treatise
                        on the picturesque, the sublime, and the beautiful. It is needless to say, that his
                        treatise overflows with fine and true thoughts and observations; nor does any man
                        living better understand, or more deeply feel, the characteristic qualities of the
                        scenery of Westmoreland. Yet it is somewhat heavy, even as a philosophical essay.”
                        He goes on to opine that such guides are perhaps best written by non-natives of a
                        region, who might offer a more “impartial and reasonable work” (264).

                        groves can blight picturesque scenes, he encourages cultivation of the tree in waste

                        of white-washed cottages. Rather than unnatural eyesores, Gibson argues, white cottages

                     <p class="noCount">After rehearsing the textual history of the <em>Guide, </em>this early biography praises the book’s ability to bring the region’s land forms,
                        flora, and fauna to life. Symington is perhaps most impressed by Wordsworth’s depiction
                        of “the inhabitants of the Dales, with their homesteads and manner of living.” In
                        this respect, it is “quite a model, and probably the most accurate and interesting
                        thing of the kind ever written.” He concludes his section on the <em>Guide </em>by speculating on the economic impact of Wordsworth’s writing on the region: “there
                        is not an inn or small farmhouse in all the Lake Country which does not reap in hard
                        coin the results” (2:53-54).

                        does, however, single out Wordsworth’s <em>Guide</em> as an exception to the “usual monotony” and briefly recaps the poet’s strictures
                        on white-wash and larch trees.

                     <p class="noCount">This paper, initially presented to the Wordsworth Society in 1883, might be considered
                        the first major critical essay on the <em>Guide</em>. Brooke begins by contrasting the relative detachment of Gray’s guide to the Lake
                        District with the passion of Wordsworth’s. From there he traces how Wordsworth’s love
                        for the region and gift for poetical description show through in the <em>Guide</em>.

                        “capital companion on a tramp over the Wordsworth country, being not merely illuminating,
                        but highly practical” (225). Campbell’s main concern, though, is bibliographical,
                        as he corrects compilers who fail to recognize that such poems as “Long Meg and Her
                        Daughters” and “Waterfowl” were first published in the <em>Guide</em>.

                        “Taken by itself, and apart from all detailed topography,” he concludes, “it is by
                        far the best ‘Guide to the Lakes’ that exists” (xxii).

                        friend.” Woolf claims that, unlike writers chiefly concerned about stylistic flourishes
                        or literary fashions, Wordsworth wrote his <em>Guide</em> with authority and logic. She admires his intricate knowledge of the area and his
                        insistence on spiritual richness and systematic order within the natural world. Compared
                        with the ornate word-sketches in Rawnsley’s <em>Months at the Lakes</em>, Wordsworth’s descriptions ring with solemn but imaginative honesty. “There are few,”
                        she writes, “who would not seem to write diluted English after the terse veracity
                        of the poet’s prose.”

                     <p class="noCount">Nabholtz counters scholarship that distances Wordsworth’s <em>Guide</em> from the picturesque tradition, arguing that, far from departing from his predecessors,
                        Wordsworth was deeply influenced by picturesque writers and theorists such as William
                        Gilpin, Uvedale Price, and Thomas West. While Wordsworth aimed to refine prevailing
                        tastes and perceptual habits, he largely worked within recognizable codes.

                     <p class="noCount">Owen considers Wordsworth’s landscape aesthetics by comparing different editions of
                        the <em>Guide</em> to Wordsworth’s fragmentary essay the <em>Sublime and Beautiful</em> and his incomplete <em>Unpublished Tour</em>. He highlights important ways in which all three of Wordsworth’s prose commentaries

                        that Wordsworth’s use of mirror imagery in the <em>Guide</em> combines “stillness and movement,” creating a picture that simultaneously reflects
                        the constraints of time and the power of the human imagination.

                     <p class="noCount">In the <em>Guide,</em> Marder argues, Wordsworth repeatedly begins with “familiar vision and vocabulary”
                        drawn from the picturesque tradition before then moving on to “analytical observation,”
                        fresh language, and more refined perspectives (32). As a result, the <em>Guide </em>manages to foreground Wordsworth’s original aesthetic and moral ideas. While its main
                        procedure is to move readers from the familiar to the new, it “never quite overcomes
                        the traditions of the picturesque” (35).

                        of the Lake District from the eighteenth century to the present. Pages 77–91 treat
                        Wordsworth specifically, with one short section, “Wordsworth as Guide,” arguing not
                        only that the <em>Guide to the Lakes</em> “became the standard work on the visual qualities of the Lake District” (80), but,
                        more importantly, that it inaugurated a crucial shift “from critical pictorialism
                        to a sense of responsibility for [the landscape’s] right development and careful conservation”
                        (80). This shift would become decisive in English culture. In connection with this
                        discussion, the authors also foreground Wordsworth’s interests in landscape design
                        and gardening, urging readers not to overlook “this side of Wordsworth’s nature,”
                        which so clearly drove the ethics of the <em>Guide</em>.

                     <p class="noCount">Davies argues that Wordsworth’s opinions on forestry in general and larches in particular
                        were heavily influenced by Gilpin’s <em>Remarks on Forest Scenery</em> (1791). As an editorial aside, Davies notes that this is “the only subject about
                        which I find myself in complete disagreement with Wordsworth. I enjoy the larch greatly,
                        and can only suppose that he had seen none but immature specimens, and in those close
                        plantations which are necessary for economic forestry” (317).

                     <p class="noCount">In her chapter on “Archeologies,” Kelley argues that Wordsworth’s <em>Guide</em> privileges two aesthetic arguments. First, Wordsworth endorses the Coleridgean definition
                        of beauty as “Multeity in Unity.” Second, and more radically, he suggests that the
                        beautiful is a natural progression and completion of the sublime. Kelley argues that
                        Wordsworth’s reckoning of sublimity as inherently deficient, primordial, and precursory
                        to the beautiful is evident in the way he stratifies the topography and history of
                        the Lake District. This stratification, according to Kelley, reflects Wordsworth’s
                        attempts to map out the workings of his own imagination.

                     <p class="noCount">Roberts’s essay considers the importance of John Brown, an influential eighteenth-century
                        writer and critic, as a predecessor to Thomas Gray and William Wordsworth. The article
                        focuses specifically on Brown’s posthumously published poem “Night Scene in the Vale
                        of Keswick,” which was first published in 1776 and subsequently reprinted in the 1835
                        edition of Wordsworth’s <em>Guide</em>. Roberts suggests that while Brown likely found his poem unsuitable for publication
                        because of its suppressed romantic quality, the poem provided a seminal “modern” description
                        of mountain scenery that inspired writers like Thomas Gray and Wordsworth. In fact,
                        Robert asserts that both Gray and Wordsworth attempted to recreate Brown’s alpine
                        experience and imitated his style.

                     <p class="noCount">In her chapter on “Digesting Wordsworth,” Gigante analyzes intellectual and spiritual
                        “feeding” metaphors in the poet’s verse and maintains that the <em>Guide </em>offers a tutorial in “viewing, or intellectually feeding upon, nature” (79). Gigante
                        posits that the <em>Guide</em> attempts to distinguish the elevated “feeding mind” that can appropriate and order
                        the material world through imagination from a mind of “bad taste” that is driven by
                        merely consumerist impulses. Wordsworth, she argues, finds himself caught between
                        models of consumption, and his struggle helps explain the irony of his complaining
                        about the incursions of tourists and trains even while writing guidebooks for visitors.

                        nature in the abstract, as an idealized manifestation of the divine or the essence
                        of the beautiful or sublime. The other refers to nature as physical matter. By using
                        Nietzsche’s “fiction of causation” as a model for describing this duality, Schatz-Jakobsen
                        argues we can better understand how these two definitions function in the <em>Guide</em>.

                        of a particular setting—the things that make up a place’s essence—and situating this
                        place in reference to “scenic settings abroad.” In this sense, the localist focus
                        of the <em>Guide</em> is not “anti-urban” so much as it is a response to shifts in globalization and the
                        emergence of mass tourism. While eighteenth-and early nineteenth-century tourism encouraged
                        travelers to discover similarities between “picturesque” environments, the <em>Guide</em> distinguishes the Lake District from foreign places of sublime or picturesque interest.</span></li>

                        (36).

                     <p class="noCount">Moldenhauer asserts that Wordsworth’s <em>Guide </em>had a significant influence on Thoreau’s <em>Walden</em>. Despite his appreciation for the <em>Guide</em>, Thoreau felt Wordsworth was unduly concerned with external “improvements” to the
                        land rather than with individual character development. Thoreau’s commentary on cottage
                        architecture disparages Wordsworth’s aestheticism, reinforcing instead the virtues
                        of the self-made individual and presenting the construction of beautiful buildings
                        in the natural world as the outgrowth of the builder’s self.

                        and efforts to inspire a national preservation movement remain relevant. Particularly
                        in Chapter 2, Bate argues that, as one of the poet’s bestselling works and “an exemplar
                        of the Romantic ecology” (45), the <em>Guide </em>should be central to Wordsworthian and Romantic studies: “To think for a moment of
                        Wordsworth as pre-eminently not the author of ‘Tintern Abbey’ and <em>The Prelude</em> but the compiler of the <em>Guide to the Lakes</em> will thus be not only to recover an important nineteenth-century view of him, but
                        also to begin to move away from narrow canonicity. If we are to historicize Romanticism,
                        we must bring the <em>Guide </em>from the periphery to the centre. The neglect of it is quite extraordinary” (42).

                        in his <em>Guide “</em>the germ of the National Trust’s long gestation” (260). Gill points to Wordsworth’s
                        famous description of the Lake District “as a sort of national property,” concluding,
                        “That hundreds of thousands of people every year walk over unenclosed hills, of enjoy
                        access to lake shores, is his greatest, and most fitting memorial” (260).

                     <p class="noCount">McKusick highlights ecological arguments in the <em>Guide, </em>contending (against some skeptical critics) that Wordsworth’s agenda was not merely
                        to preserve the Lakes for the social elite but also to warn of broader impacts increased
                        traffic would have on the region. Wordsworth, he says, was “prophetic in his understanding
                        that unlimited transportation access, recreational development, and suburban sprawl
                        will ultimately ruin the rural landscape for everyone who inhabits it, both rich and

                        a reservoir, proposed in the 1870s and completed in the 1890s, provoked one of the
                        first modern environmental controversies, pitting “the Victorian icon of nature” (sanctified
                        by Wordsworth) against “the Victorian icon of progress” (2–3). This debate was remarkable,
                        Ritvo argues, because it hinged on the emerging, radical notion (adumbrated by the
                        <em>Guide</em>) that the public, national and even transnational, could have interest in a landscape
                        that was privately owned.

                        as Wordsworth imagined it and to identify the region not only with his literary work
                        but also with the poet himself. Against Bate and other celebrants of Wordsworth’s
                        ecological sensibility, Hess asserts that the <em>Guide</em>’s argument is fundamentally aesthetic, not environmental.

                        traveling in the north of England. He attributes the phenomenon to the region’s association

                        that Wordsworth also realized he would have to align his literary idealization of
                        the landscape with recognized methods of delineating space and land.

                        and evolution of the Lake District.

                        <em>Guide</em> and the series of guidebooks Alfred Wainwright published between 1955 and 1966. Wordsworth’s
                        <em>Guide</em>, Moseley argues, is written as if the reader physically travels with Wordsworth.
                        In its pedestrian sensibility, it anticipates Wainwright’s books for fell-walkers.
                        While, like earlier writers in the picturesque tradition, Wordsworth privileges valley
                        “views” and “prospects,” he offers a new sense of immersion, a feeling for the walker’s
                        route, and a willingness to celebrate hard-earned views from above.

                     <p class="noCount">All of Wordsworth’s Lake District writing, Carlson argues, reflects and inflects key
                        developments in the picturesque representation of the Lakes. In particular, his work
                        shows how such representation became increasingly multi-medial, incorporating maps,
                        engravings, poems, diagrams, and other tools to define and materialize British terrain.
                        Depicting the British landscape cartographically became linked with describing it
                        in poetic meter. It is no coincidence, Carlson notes, that Wordsworth’s poetry records
                        some of the first cultural responses to the Ordnance Survey of Britain, nor that his
                        own <em>Guide</em> came to incorporate many different materials “as if they were comparable visual aids
                        to the experience of landscape” (88). In fact, Wordsworth’s <em>Guide</em> influenced the next generation of tour books, which worked to merge art, literature,
                        travel, and science.

                     <p class="noCount">Smethurst evaluates how scientific metaphors, particularly those espoused by work
                        in optics, geology, and natural history, inform Wordsworth’s romantic vision in the
                        <em>Guide</em>. Arguing that Wordsworth draws upon “shared imaginative structure and schemata” that
                        shaped eighteenth-century scientific and creative discourse, Smethurst highlights
                        textual points in the <em>Guide</em> that resonate with writings of other “traveler-scientists.” His interest in the <em>Guide</em> is part of Smethurst’s larger exploration of how eighteenth-century and romantic
                        practices in tourism and natural history detached “nature” from the actual environment.

                     <p class="noCount">Porter’s essay describes the evolving discipline of topography and its management
                        of competing genres, linked variously with the modern discourses of feeling and fact.
                        Wordsworth’s <em>Guide</em> enters the essay in its final section, serving as a case study of topography’s development.
                        Porter traces the <em>Guide</em>’s transformation through its various editions, highlighting Wordsworth’s attempts
                        to reconcile discourses that often competed with one another. Ultimately, the edition
                        of 1835 “enhanced the text’s relationship to picturesque aesthetics while subsuming
                        (but carefully maintaining) its alignment with the representational techniques of
                        physical geography” (175). If nineteenth-century poets of place and readers of like
                        spirit preferred the language of personal observation and response, Porter argues,
                        they also found authority and practical value in the new topography.

                        his essay as an addendum to both the 1820 “Topographical Description” and the 1822
                        <em>Description of the Scenery of the Lakes</em> because of mounting tensions between the writers. Personalities aside, however, De
                        Quincey’s and Wordsworth’s shared conservative politics are on full display in “Danish

                        governance.

                     <p class="noCount">Squire shows that the Romantic emphasis on imagination and emotional experience fostered
                        a strong tourism industry in the North of England bent on framing the landscape as
                        an idyllic, untamed region. Squire explores the <em>Guide</em> specifically as an important example of how the Romantic ideology generated a literary
                        lens through which tourists “read” the Lake District.

                     <p class="noCount">In his final chapter, “Rash Assault: Nature and the Nature of Tourism,” Ousby turns
                        to the Lake District to study how “nature” has come to function as “a necessary refuge,
                        a source of spiritual renewal” (101). Paradoxically, he remarks, the very tourists
                        who visit places like the Lakes for spiritual sustenance often destroy what they cherish;
                        Wordsworth himself famously took up these questions. Of the <em>Guide</em> specifically, Ousby writes that, although it was far from the first guidebook of
                        its kind, it made earlier efforts seem unliterary and incomplete in comparison. Moreover,
                        the <em>Guide</em> cemented Wordsworth’s status as a “Lake Poet,” embodying what was finally his greatest
                        impact on tourism—namely, the invention of a literary landscape inseparable from the
                        poet’s life and work.

Oxford: Clarendon, 1993.</span></span> 
                     <p class="noCount">Buzard’s chapter on “Tourist and Traveller” helps explain how Wordsworth could both
                        complain about tourists and write guidebooks for them. Travel literature dealt in
                        anti-tourist rhetoric from the start, Buzard contends, because the “tourist” was the
                        (supposedly) less cultured, less sophisticated person against whom a true “traveller”
                        could define himself. When Wordsworth directed his guidebook to “the <em>Minds</em> of Persons of taste,” he was seeking “readers who would live up to the calling of
                        true travellers” (30). Such sensitive beings could visit the Lake District without
                        desecrating it. In this context, Buzard describes the <em>Guide</em> as an example of the “anti-guidebook” genre. Buzard concludes that Wordsworth’s <em>Guide</em> lost much of its idiosyncratic flavor when incorporated into Hudson’s <em>Complete Guide</em> of 1842. By that time, travel books based on individual authority were beginning
                        to seem obsolete, as the age of the comprehensive Baedecker and Murray handbooks had
                        arrived.

                     <p class="noCount">Labbe compares how Priscilla Wakefield’s <em>A Family Tour</em> and Wordsworth’s <em>Guide</em> appropriate and revise eighteenth-century aesthetics of the sublime and the beautiful.
                        She suggests that, in the <em>Guide</em>, Wordsworth sets himself up as a “patriarch” of the Lake District and ensures that
                        those tourists who read his guidebook will vicariously experience the region through
                        his perspective. Ultimately, Labbe concludes, Wordsworth wants to create an “undifferentiated
                        Nature, undisturbed by detail,” in order to reinforce his self-appointed position
                        as the leading guide to the region.

                        and philosophical artifact as well as a product of natural forces. By his account,
                        “Wordsworth’s aerial picture must have done much to fix the idea of a ‘district’ in
                        people’s minds” (100). While the Lakeland was popular before Wordsworth wrote his
                        <em>Guide</em>, Wordsworth helped tourists conceive of the area “as a distinct entity, separate
                        from those bits of its constituent counties that did not fit the Picturesque ideal”
                        (10).

                     <p class="noCount">This rich, multidisciplinary essay collection explores the history of Lake District
                        tourism from the 1700s to the present. The <em>Guide</em> appears in various essays: Susan Denyer’s meditation on Lakeland as both “nature”
                        and cultural artifact; John Walton’s interrogation of the Lakes as a potential <em>world</em> heritage site; Melanie Hall’s account of Wordsworth’s transatlantic influence on
                        the national parks movement; Keith Hanley’s piece on the Romantic invention of Lake
                        District literary tourism; Sarah Rutherford’s case study of Claife Station (a picturesque
                        viewing spot); and David Cooper’s discussion of the “Post-Industrial Picturesque.”
                        Wordsworth thus appears in the guises of pioneer of regional geography, environmental
                        preservationist, inspiration for the founders of the National Trust, and theorist
                        of a benevolent British empire.

                     <p class="noCount">Yoshikawa argues that Wordsworth’s growing reputation in the 1800s owed as much to
                        Lakeland guidebooks as it did to formal biographies, editions, and critical works.
                        The <em>Guide to the Lakes</em> enters her narrative as an ur-text, the inspiration for a number of more popular,
                        user-friendly guidebooks that broadened Wordsworth’s cultural influence. While the
                        <em>Guide</em> did not in itself attract a mass readership or serve as direct reference for the
                        majority of Victorian tourists who visited the Lakes, it did set terms for appreciating
                        the Lake District in a “Wordsworthian” manner and helped define the “Lake District”
                        itself as a single destination.

                     <p class="noCount">Thomas takes up “guide” figures in Wordsworth’s writing: guides divine, natural, and
                        human, some trustworthy and others unreliable. Noting that the theme of guidance runs
                        throughout Wordsworth’s oeuvre, Thomas suggests that readers consult the text in which
                        Wordsworth most explicitly assumes the role of guide, the <em>Guide to the Lakes</em>, for clues about the poet’s thoughts on the subject. Thomas elaborates especially
                        on Wordsworth’s aim to guide the <em>minds</em> of his readers. Wordsworth’s authority derives from intimate local knowledge, but
                        even more so from habits of observation and reflection.

                     <p class="noCount">In this speculative essay, Chandler presents internal evidence that certain sections
                        of <em>Select Views </em>(1810)—particularly the descriptions of Crummock Water and Brothers Water—might have
                        been influenced by the imaginary tour of the Lakes that Southey included in <em>Letters from England</em> (1807). Although there is no definitive proof that Wordsworth read Southey’s volume,
                        it was published just weeks before Wordsworth began working on <em>Select Views.</em></p>

                     <p class="noCount">Gill examines points of textual similarity between the poetry and prose in the 1820
                        <em>River Duddon</em> volume, suggesting that, while the volume is a miscellany, it is also unified in
                        the sense that it “both literally and metaphorically begins and ends in the Lake District”
                        (25). Notably, Gill argues that “Topographical Description” extends and enhances Wordsworth’s
                        poetical vision as presented in the <em>River Duddon</em> poems. Gill frames his argument within the context of the rise of tourism and the
                        critical reception of the Lake School.

                     <p class="noCount">Simonsen argues that Wordsworth was an ekphrastic poet and that his interest in visual
                        arts has been underplayed in scholarship. Noting that <em>Select Views</em> was commissioned as the textual companion to a series of sketches, Simonsen finds
                        ekphrastic qualities in Wordsworth’s prose from the 1810 edition forward.

                     <p class="noCount">Carlson proposes that guidebooks, by quoting illustrative snippets of blank verse,
                        helped bring about the Romantic-era naturalization and nationalization of blank verse
                        as a lyric form. Whereas other tour writers borrowed poetic descriptions of different
                        locales—say, from Milton or Thomson—and applied them to Lake District features, Wordsworth
                        included poetry that presented itself as autochthonous. Carlson shows how Wordsworth’s
                        quotations in the <em>Guide</em> (1) translate the ideas and objects described into the register of individual experience,
                        (2) demonstrate “the mind’s penetration by images,” (3) serve as illustrations or
                        “verse-pictures,” and (4) institute pauses for contemplation, halting the reader’s
                        movement as if enforcing visual attention.

                     <p class="noCount">For Fulford, Wordsworth’s later work “was neither an escape from history as New Historicist
                        critics argued in the 1980s, nor, on any simple level, an ecological poetry, as eco-critics
                        suggested in the 1990s, but a topographic writing allied with guidebooks and local
                        histories, and preoccupied with the landscape as a place marked by the deeds of past
                        Britons—a historicized nationalism” (7). Fulford mentions the <em>Guide</em> in this context, contending also that the book in its various editions shows Wordsworth
                        taking advantage of new trends in publishing and meeting the demands of late-Romantic
                        and Victorian audiences.
