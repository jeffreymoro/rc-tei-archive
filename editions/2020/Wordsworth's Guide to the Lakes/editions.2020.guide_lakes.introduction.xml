                <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Preface to the Second Edition:</hi> The initial 2015 release of this <title level="j">Romantic Circles</title> 
                    edition of William Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> provided unprecedented resources for 
                    studying an essay that, over two centuries after its first publication, is still considered a classic in the English 
                    environmentalist tradition and one of its author’s greatest accomplishments in prose. Gratefully, our edition has been 
                    warmly received and widely used. Subsequent to its completion, however, our ongoing research on Wordsworth’s essay has 
                    yielded important discoveries about its origins, composition, and circulation, many of which elucidate or undercut 
                    traditional narratives surrounding the <title level="m">Guide</title> that informed our 2015 edition. Accordingly, 
                    with <title level="j">Romantic Circles</title>’ support, we set out to update, revise, and supplement our earlier work 
                    in this second digital edition of Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title>. (For a full list of changes, see 
                    <ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.about.html">About This Edition</ref>.)</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">The findings that occasioned this edition are presented in a new appendix,

                        <title level="a">The Serial Publication of <title level="m">Select Views</title>,</title></ref> and the 
                      completely revised introduction that follows. This trove of additional material may well leave some readers 
                      feeling we have crossed the hazy border between the properly expansive 
                    and genuinely bloated. Bearing this in mind, we have provided links at the head of this document allowing readers 
                    to go directly to sections of particular interest. Section I (<ref target="#section1">A 
                    <title level="m">Guide</title> for the Twenty-first Century</ref>) of this introduction offers a brief history of 
                    reactions to and scholarship on the <title level="m">Guide</title> before outlining the purposes and value of this 
                    online edition. Section II (<ref target="#section2">Joseph Wilkinson and <title level="m">Select Views</title> 
                        [1810]</ref>) introduces the amateur artist and former neighbor of the Lake Poets whose series of Lake District 
                    drawings included the first published version of Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title>. Sections III 
                    (<ref target="#section3">William Wordsworth: Ghost Writer</ref>), IV (<ref target="#section4">Drafting and Publishing 
                        the First Edition</ref>), and V (<ref target="#section5">Expanding and Revising the 
                            <title level="m">Guide</title> [1820–1835]</ref>) chronicle Wordsworth’s unprecedented—and often 
                    fraught—experience working as Wilkinson’s pen-for-hire and his obsessive reworkings of the <title level="m">Guide</title> 
                    for four new editions published between 1820 and 1835. Finally, Sections VI (<ref target="#section6">Writing the Lake 
                        District</ref>) and VII (<ref target="#section7">The Originality of Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title></ref>) 
                    explore the rise of Lake District tourism during the poet’s lifetime and how his <title level="m">Guide</title> both 
                    draws upon and surpasses earlier works on the region, the picturesque, and the preservation of cherished landscapes.</p>

               <p>Since first appearing under William Wordsworth’s name in 1820, the <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title>, as it 
                   has come to be known, has never lacked for admirers.<note place="foot" resp="editors">As detailed below, Wordsworth’s 
                       essay appeared under various names before he titled his fifth, and final, revised edition of 1835 
                       <title level="m">A Guide through the District of the Lakes in the North of England</title>. The shorthand 
                       <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> became common in the late nineteenth century and even more firmly 
                       fixed with Ernest De Sélincourt’s 1906 edition, <title level="m">Wordsworth’s Guide to the Lakes</title> (London: 
                       Henry Frowde). Keeping with convention, then, we refer to all editions as the <title level="m">Guide to the 
                           Lakes</title> (or simply the <title level="m">Guide</title>). Given that William Wordsworth is the principal 
                       focus of this edition, “Wordsworth” designates him throughout, though occasionally we use his first name 
                       in passages mentioning multiple Wordsworths. When referring to Dorothy Wordsworth, we use her given name 
                       to avoid confusion.</note> Early reviewers lavished the sort of uniform and unqualified praise upon this extended 
                   essay on England’s Lake District that its writer had long coveted for his poetry, dubbing it a 
                   “very agreeable performance” (the <title level="j">Literary Gazette</title>), “as topographically 
                   useful as it is <emph>poetically picturesque</emph>” 
                   (the <title level="j">Monthly Review</title>), and “by far the best specimen of the prose style of Wordsworth which has 
                   ever been given to the world” (<title level="j">Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</title>).<note place="foot"

                   <title level="j">Athenaeum</title> gushed, “We could find in our hearts to write a separate article on

                           level="m">Guide</title> became entrenched as the go-to guidebook for nineteenth-century Lake District tourists 
                   and has remained a classic study of landscape aesthetics and environmental ethics ever since. In introducing his 
                   1879 edition of Wordsworth’s poems, Matthew Arnold famously recounted how an ill-informed tourist once asked the 
                   poet “if he had ever written anything besides the <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title>. Yes, he answered 
                   modestly, he had written verses.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Matthew Arnold, <title level="a">Preface,</title>

                   later, Andrew James Symington conjectured that there was “not an inn or small farmhouse” mentioned in the <title

                               level="m">Guide</title>’s foot-and-carriage itineraries obsolete, enthusiasts for the book redoubled their 
                   claims for its timelessness. No less a card-carrying modernist than Virginia Woolf revered it as a “happily permanent 
                   friend” that offered “all the courtesy and consideration of an old inhabitant who does the honours of the place to a

               <p>Wordsworth himself was unmistakably proud of the <title level="m">Guide</title>, revising it more fully and repeatedly

                   historical, and cultural introduction to his native region as the anonymous letterpress for <title level="m">Select 
                       Views in Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire</title> (1810), a set of 48 prints of landscape sketches 
                   by the Reverend Joseph Wilkinson (1764–1831). In the years ahead, Wordsworth trimmed the roughly 27,700-word essay of 
                   1810 to 20,200 words, meticulously revised the remaining sections, and published it under his own name as an appendix to 
                   his <title level="m">River Duddon</title> collection of 1820. Deciding soon thereafter to repurpose his essay as a 
                   full-fledged guidebook, he expanded it to 29,800 words for the first stand-alone version of the <title 
                       level="m">Guide</title> of 1822 and made further additions and revisions for new editions of 1823 (35,300 words) 
                   and 1835 (38,300 words). Finally, in 1842, having shepherded five editions of the <title level="m">Guide</title> to 
                   press over three decades, the 72-year-old Wordsworth supervised the Kendal publishers Hudson and Nicholson’s reprinting 
                   of his 1835 text in a volume including Adam Sedgwick’s groundbreaking studies of Lake District geology.<note place="foot"

                   steady, if never spectacular, sales, with new British editions appearing in 1823, 1835, 1842, 1843, 1846, 1853, and 
                   1859. Then, thanks to Wordsworth’s lofty status among the Victorians and the expiration of the 1835 edition’s copyright 
                   in 1877, it regularly resurfaced in complete-works collections and new-generation travel guides. Inexplicably, however, 
                   nearly a half-century passed between the 1859 printing and the next stand-alone version, the Ernest De Sélincourt edition 
                   of 1906 that introduced Wordsworth’s essay to a new generation of readers. Over the rest of the twentieth century, 
                   it remained generally available, whether through 1926 and 1970 reissues of De Sélincourt or illustrated editions by 
                   R. J. Hutchings (1977) and Peter Bicknell (1984); and today most early editions are freely available through platforms

                <p>As noted above, the earliest version of Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> appeared as the 
                    anonymous prose supplement to the Rev. Joseph Wilkinson’s <title level="m">Select Views in Cumberland,  Westmoreland, 
                        and Lancashire</title>, a series of engravings sold primarily to affluent collectors of landscape prints and 
                    associates of the artist.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Wilkinson was apparently unaware of a 1792 series of 
                        landscape prints bearing a nearly identical title: Peter Holland’s <title level="m">Select Views of the Lakes in 
                            Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire</title> (Liverpool: James Smith). For details on the collecting of 
                        prints, see Antony Griffiths, <title level="m">The Print before Photograph: An Introduction to European Printmaking

                    offering the commission in mid-1809 and Wordsworth’s completing it in late 1810, the two never spoke in person, as the 
                    poet lived in Grasmere in the Lake District and the artist 300 miles to the southeast in Thetford, Norfolk, where he 
                    served as rector of East and West Wretham and domestic chaplain to the Marquis of Huntly. Wilkinson was a Lakelander 
                    at heart, however. After being raised in Carlisle, he left for Cambridge in his late teens before returning in 1794, 
                    at age thirty, when his wife became the caregiver for her ailing uncle, the renowned chemist William Brownrigg. During 
                    the decade they ultimately spent at Ormathwaite Hall, Brownrigg’s home near Keswick, Wilkinson devoted his time to 
                    sketching the region’s beauties and serving as curate of Irthington (near Carlisle) and Monkwearmouth (near 
                    Sunderland).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Unlike William Brownrigg (1711–1800, <title level="m">DNB</title>), who 
                        was famed for his work on mine gasses, table salt, and platinum’s physical properties, Wilkinson remained 
                        obscure throughout his life. A brief obituary in the <title level="j">Gentleman’s Magazine</title> noted his 
                        Oct. 1831 death (Nov. 1831, 472–73), but the fullest Wilkinson biographies come in two Wordsworth Trust

                <p>During their final years in Ormathwaite, the Wilkinsons befriended the families of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and 
                    Robert Southey, who resided at Greta Hall in nearby Keswick.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Coleridge and Southey 
                        had married the Fricker sisters, Sara and Edith, in 1795. The Coleridges moved to Keswick in May 1800. While 
                        the Southeys made a long visit in 1801, they didn’t relocate to Keswick until September 1803.</note> This, in 
                    turn, brought them into the orbit of the Wordsworths. Dorothy Wordsworth’s journals from 1802 capture growing intimacy 
                    with the Wilkinsons, recording her brother and Coleridge visiting Ormathwaite, the families dining together in 
                    Keswick, her walking “with Mrs. W. [to] the Quakers’ meeting,” and their receiving “Wilkinson’s drawings” by 
                    post.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See the entries for 29 and 31 March (p. 83) and 1 July 1802 (p. 117) in 
                        <title level="m">The Grasmere and Alfoxden Journals</title>, ed. Pamela Woof (Oxford: Oxford UP, 2002). Woof 
                        suggests Wordsworth may have met Wilkinson as early as 1794, as the clergyman’s sisters had married brothers of 
                        the poet’s friend James Losh (p. 229). For additional interactions between the families, see Reed, 
                        <title level="m">Middle Years</title>, 157, 163–64, and 184. That Dorothy knew the Ormathwaite house well is 
                        suggested by a 1 Jan. 1810 letter to her childhood friend Jane Marshall in which she opines, “the imagination 
                        cannot conceive a more delightful place” but laments, “there are no large rooms and it is an old house, and I 
                        should think even out of repair” (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:381–82).</note> Of the three Lake Poets, 
                    Southey was apparently closest to Wilkinson. In a 7 January 1804 letter to William Taylor, Southey mentions how 
                    Wilkinson “is my neighbour at present &amp; a very excellent one I find him.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                        Cockermouth.</note> Two years later, after the Wilkinsons had moved to Thetford, Southey made a lengthy detour 
                    to visit them during a trip to the south. Writing his wife back in Keswick, the poet reported that their old 
                    neighbor remained “the very cream of human kindness.” Still, having moved to a region “utterly without beauty,” the 
                    couple openly pined for the Lakes. Wilkinson, he reports, grew sentimental “at the thought of Ormathwaite,” and “Mrs 
                    W. never looks at the drawing of it but the tears come in her eyes.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                        The two remained in close contact at least through the end of 1807, when Southey informed Wilkinson of his 
                        brother’s plan to practice medicine near Thetford (see 
                        <ref target="/editions/southey_letters/Part_Three/HTML/letterEEd.26.1405.html">Letter 1405</ref>, 27 Dec.

                  <p>The “drawing of it” that Mrs. Wilkinson apparently found so affecting may have been one of the two sketches of

                    attempt at publishing his artwork that he abandoned in the mid-1790s. Why <title level="m">Northern Scenery</title> 
                    never went to press remains a mystery, as Wilkinson not only completed forty-nine drawings for the series but 
                    also commissioned the Manchester artist William Marshall Craig to design a title page and multiple frontispieces 
                    (figs. 1 and 2).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Wilkinson’s <title level="m">Northern Scenery</title> drawings,

                    have ever seen, has produced the <emph>genuine</emph> tint and style of that country, in any degree equal to the 
                    drawings of my friend the Rev. Mr. Wilkinson, of Ormathwaite; who has, in his representations, exhibited the character

                 <p>Buoyed by such support, in late 1808 Wilkinson circulated his first call for subscribers to <title level="m">Select 
                    Views</title> in small newspapers serving his Thetford parish. (For full details on his decision to publish serially 
                    and by subscription, see <ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.serialpublication.html">Appendix 
                        1</ref>.) At this point, Wilkinson planned to include sketches of the two principal Lake District counties, 
                    Cumberland and Westmoreland, plus “Part of Scotland.” He also apparently imagined a primarily local subscriber base, 
                    as he confined his advertisements to the nearby <title level="j">Bury and Norwich Post</title> and 
                    <title level="j">Norfolk Chronicle</title> and directed would-be subscribers to the town booksellers in Thetford and 
                    Bury (fig. 3). Yet, for a first-time author preparing what was essentially a vanity publication, Wilkinson 
                    displayed an impressive understanding of the conventional design, distribution, and pricing of such series, an expertise 
                    likely acquired via his hobby of collecting of landscape prints.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In his 1797 travel 
                        diary, Johnson Grant notes how, while at “Armathwaite,” his party was “entertained by many paintings and prints, 
                        collected by Mr. Wilkinson and his brother, an Oxford man, who both take sketches well themselves” (273). Grant’s 
                        <title level="a">Journal of a Three Weeks Tour, in 1797, through Derbyshire to the Lakes</title> appeared anonymously 
                        in Vol. 5 of William Mavor’s <title level="m">The British Tourists; or Traveller’s Pocket Companion, through England, 
                            Wales, Scotland, and Ireland</title>, 5 vols. (London: Newbery, 1798).</note> Although he would eventually 
                    narrow his geographic focus and target a nationwide audience, in most particulars the series Wilkinson proposed in 
                    late 1808—48 plates measuring “14 inches by 10 inches” to be distributed four at a time over 12 months, “executed by 
                    the most eminent Artists,” and printed on quality paper that would “admit of tinting”—closely corresponded with what 
                    subscribers actually received in 1810.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Although <title level="m">Select Views</title> 
                        is frequently described and cataloged as a folio, it was slightly larger than the traditional volume advertised as 
                        such. Later advertisements (e.g., fig. 7) promise the use of oversized “double Elephant” (or 41” x 27”) paper. 
                        Folded in half, this paper measured 20.5” x 13.5,” making it roughly 1.5” taller and wider than those found in the 
                        standard 12” x 19” folio. These large sheets help account for the series’ unusually wide margins.</note></p>

                        (1808–10). This popular series—the last number of which appeared on the same day, 1 Jan. 1810, as the first 
                        of <title level="m">Select Views</title>—featured a more extensive letterpress than any previous Ackermann title.

                    to include supplementary prose, a second set of notices that began appearing in national magazines in February 1809 now 
                    indicated that the sketches of “the most picturesque situations” would indeed appear “with letter-press descriptions” 
                    (fig. 4).<note place="foot" resp="editors">This same notice appeared in the <title level="j">Eclectic Review</title>

                    as a Cambridge graduate, veteran clergyman, and devotee of Lake District scenery, Wilkinson might have written passable 
                    descriptions himself. But, taking no half-measures with this long-deferred passion project, he turned to his Lake Poet

                    <p>Only one document, a letter Wilkinson sent Coleridge in early June 1809, survives from the negotiations that 
                        resulted in Wordsworth contributing to <title level="m">Select Views</title> 
                        (<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.letters.html#letter3">letter 3</ref>).<note place="foot" 
                            resp="editors">Now in the Wordsworth Trust archives, Wilkinson’s letter to Coleridge is reproduced in Owen 
                            and Smyser, <title level="m">Prose Works</title> (2:124) and Reed, <title level="m">Middle Years</title> 
                            (p. 671). Two details suggest this undated letter was written in early June 1809. First, Wilkinson reports 
                            having read “with much pleasure &amp; interest” the first issue of Coleridge’s <title level="m">The 
                                Friend</title>, which appeared on 1 June 1809. Second, in a separate letter dated 10 June 1809, 
                            Wordsworth conveys to the publisher of <title level="m">The Friend</title> names and addresses for four 
                            new subscribers that Wilkinson had forwarded in his letter (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 8: 17–18). 
                            In early June, Coleridge was away visiting a friend near Penrith, and he wouldn’t return to Grasmere until 
                            the 13th. It therefore appears Wordsworth opened Wilkinson’s letter in his housemate’s absence, as he would 
                            not have otherwise had the subscriber details he forwarded prior to Coleridge’s return. For Coleridge’s 
                            whereabouts during these weeks, see Reed, <title level="m">Middle Years</title>, 430, and Richard Holmes, 
                            <title level="m">Coleridge: Darker Reflections, 1804–1834</title> (New York: Pantheon, 1998), 158–63.</note> 
                        From this, however, we can infer the existence of two earlier letters: an initial query from Wilkinson to Coleridge 
                        and a reply indicating Wordsworth’s potential willingness to contribute if assured <title level="m">Select 
                            Views</title> would not compete with a similar series his friend William Green would soon release. 
                        Wilkinson’s response tackles this concern head-on, reporting, “I am just returned from Town, where I have been 
                        making arrangements for my publication, and as I have seen some of Mr Green[’]s numbers I will be obliged to you 
                        if you will tell our friend Wordsworth—that no two works, descriptive of the same country can be more different, 
                        or less likely to interfere with each other, than his and mine.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">The 
                            Manchester-born Green befriended Wordsworth after moving to nearby Ambleside around 1800. His print 
                            series, <title level="m">Seventy-Eight Studies from Nature</title>, began appearing on 1 Aug. 1809.</note> 
                        Still open to Coleridge’s involvement as well, Wilkinson continues, “I shall write to Mr Wordsworth in a few days 
                        more fully upon the subject, when I hope either Mr W— or yourself, or both, will afford me the assistance I shall 
                        explain to enable me to make my work more perfect and acceptable to the public than it otherwise would be.”</p>
                    <p>Wordsworth’s subsequent acceptance of Wilkinson’s commission has long struck 
                        the poet's enthusiasts as a lamentable blight on a career otherwise distinguished for its single-minded 
                        independence. Only eight months earlier, Wordsworth had bristled at the Rev. Joseph Pering’s suggestion that he 
                        write a prose description of his native region. “Alas!,” he declared, “you have but a faint notion how disagreeable 
                        writing, of all Sorts, is to me, except from the impulse of the moment. I must be my own Task master or I can do 
                        nothing at all.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"><title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:271.</note> That he could so 
                        quickly and flagrantly abandon these high-minded ideals, resigning himself to a role that was more pen-for-hire 
                        than equal partner or co-visionary, has bewildered many. The most 
                        common interpretation is that proffered by Owen and Smyser, who put the case bluntly: “That Wordsworth should 
                        accept Joseph Wilkinson as his ‘Task master’ for even the briefest time surely indicates some kind of financial 
                        hardship.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Owen and Smyser, <title level="m">Prose</title>, 2:124. For similar 
                            interpretations, see Stephen Gill, <title level="m">William Wordsworth: A Life</title> (Oxford: Oxford UP,

                            17.</note></p>
                    <p>Evidence for this theory is abundant in the Wordsworths’ letters from 1809 and 1810, which paint a vivid portrait 
                        of economic distress. The family’s 1808 cross-town move from the beloved but cramped Dove Cottage to the roomier 
                        Allan Bank had yielded only a steadier stream of house guests and long nights spent scouring walls blackened by 
                        a faulty chimney.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See <title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:282, 364, 367, and 376. 
                            Hardship, of course, is relative, and, it bears noting that, intent on preserving some semblance of gentility, 
                            the family employed at least two servants throughout these lean years.</note> Dorothy’s letters from this 
                        period find her repeatedly imploring her tight-fisted eldest brother, Richard, to spare a mere £5. So straitened 
                        are their circumstances, she reports, that they have resolved “to give over drinking tea, and if possible, to take 
                        a house where coals are cheaper.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"><title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:385, 402,

                        a rapidly growing household with no counterbalancing source of income. His 1807 collection, <title level="m">Poems, 
                            in Two Volumes</title>, which all had hoped would stabilize his finances and usher him into the front ranks of 
                        living bards, had largely floundered. Reflecting on just how unprofitable poetry had proven, Wordsworth would 
                        estimate in 1812 that he had earned less than £140 for all his verse since 1798.<note place="foot"

                        projects offering surer pay. Dorothy reported to Thomas De Quincey on 1 May 1809—just weeks before the arrival of 
                        Wilkinson’s offer—of her brother’s “resolution to write upon publick affairs in the <title level="j">Courier</title>, 
                        or some other newspaper, for the sake of getting money; not wholly however on that account for unless he were 
                        animated by the importance of his subject and the hope of being of use he could do nothing in that way.”<note 
                            place="foot" resp="editors"><title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:325.</note> That similar motives factored into 
                        William's accepting the <title level="m">Select Views</title> commission is suggested by Dorothy’s musing six months 
                        letter, in an 18 November 1809 letter to Catherine Clarkson, “if he were to write a Guide to the Lakes and prefix 
                        this preface [to <title level="m">Select Views</title>], it would sell better, and bring him more money than any 
                        of his higher labours.” She goes on to note that William, too, “has some thoughts of doing this,” but asks that 
                        her friend “not mention it, as Mr. W[ilkinson]’s work should have its fair run”

                        ahead, factored into Wordsworth’s accepting the <title level="m">Select Views</title> commission. Yet, to suggest, 
                        as many earlier scholars have, that this renders the original draft of the <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> 
                        fundamentally compromised, even mercenary, is to concede to the Romantic—and, ironically, Wordsworthian—ideology 
                        that inspired art must be impervious to external concerns.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Influential studies

                        Wilkinson’s letterpress. While the Wordsworths’ economic distress is palpable in surviving letters from 1809, so too 
                        is the poet’s perpetual fear that Coleridge, who had moved in with them in 1808, was veering toward complete mental 
                        breakdown while frenetically attempting to launch his new weekly, <title level="j">The Friend</title>. In light of 
                        this, Wordsworth’s chief incentive for taking the commission may well have been a fear that, were he to reject 
                        it, the already teetering Coleridge would feel duty-bound to accept it out of obligation to an old neighbor who 
                        had, after all, approached him, not Wordsworth.</p>
                    <p>For that matter, it is entirely possible that foremost in Wordsworth’s mind when accepting Wilkinson’s offer was 
                        neither his family’s dire finances nor his friend’s fragility but his own artistic, intellectual, and personal 
                        enthusiasm for the proposed project. The <title level="m">Select Views</title> opportunity arrived during what 
                        would prove Wordsworth’s most sustained period of prose composition. In 1809 and 1810 alone, he wrote 30,000-plus 
                        words for <title level="m">Select Views</title>, the 216-page polemic <title level="m">The Convention of

                        developing his long-germinating theories on visual art, landscaping, and natural aesthetics. Wordsworth regularly 
                        takes up these favorite subjects in his correspondence from this period, and years later he allegedly claimed 
                        “there were three callings for success in which Nature had furnished him with qualifications—the callings of poet, 
                        landscape-gardener, and critic of pictures and works of art.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">See

                            fine arts during this period. His “three callings” remark was reportedly made to the Rev. Robert Perceval 
                            Graves, who shared it with Christopher Wordsworth for inclusion in <title level="m">Memoirs of William 
                                Wordsworth</title> (London: Moxon, 1851), 2:482.</note> Perhaps the most compelling evidence that his 
                        primary motivations may, in fact, have been intellectual comes in accounts from preceding years showing him 
                        seriously considering writing on the topics Wilkinson now proposed. The diary of the Whig grandee Lady Holland 
                        chronicles how, at a late August 1807 dinner party in Windermere, Wordsworth claimed to be “preparing a manual to 
                        guide travelers in their tour amongst the Lakes”; and, in a letter from October 1808, Wordsworth himself reports: 
                        “Last autumn, I made a little Tour, with my wife, and she was very anxious that I should preserve the memory of 
                        it by a written account. I tried to comply with her entreaty, but an insuperable dullness came over me, and I 
                        could make no progress.” Close familiarity with the region, he feared, had left him “utterly at a loss” as to 
                        “where to begin, and where to end” on the subject of “these Lakes and mountains” 
                        (<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.letters.html#letter2">letter 2</ref>).<note place="foot"

                            1908). Wordsworth may have exaggerated his actual progress to Lady Holland, as no evidence suggests he had 
                            made headway on a “manual to guide travelers” prior to their dinner. Her diary entry also valuably captures 
                            an embryonic version of what would become the <title level="m">Guide</title>’s famous passages on house 
                            colors. Wordsworth “holds some opinions on picturesque subjects with which I completely differ,” she writes, 
                            “especially as to the effects produced by <emph>white</emph> houses on the sides of the hills; to my taste 
                            they produce a cheerful effect. He, on the contrary, would brown, or even black-work them; he maintained his 
                            opinion with a considerable degree of ingenuity. His objection was chiefly grounded upon the distances being 
                            confounded by the glare of white” (2:231).</note></p>
                    <p>Whatever incentivized his reversal, Wordsworth at last felt ready to tackle this long-deferred project in the 
                        summer of 1809. Oddly enough, however, Wilkinson stayed close-lipped about having secured the poet’s services. 
                        The final calls for subscribers to <title level="m">Select Views</title> touted his agreements with Rudolph 
                        Ackermann, the elite London print dealer who had signed on as publisher, and W. F. Wells, a London engraver 
                        “whose professional merits are too well known, from his etchings . . . to need any comment.” Yet, neither these 
                        advertisements, the wrappers that bore monthly installments, nor the final published text so much as hinted that 
                        the letterpress descriptions of the Lake District would be penned by the region’s most famous living writer 
                        (figs. 5 and 6). The unmistakable conclusion, then, is that, consistent with the logic of vanity publishing, 
                        Wilkinson had sought out the Lake Poets not to capitalize on their reputations but, by presenting  
                        their words as his own, to cast himself in the best possible light. He implies as much in his previously cited 
                        letter to Coleridge from June 1809, which explains his desire for a surrogate who would “make my work more perfect 
                        and acceptable to the public than it otherwise would be” 
                        (<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.letters.html#letter3">letter 3</ref>).<note place="foot"

                    <p>By agreeing to help Wilkinson in this capacity, Wordsworth—the poet who came to define for many the ideal of an 
                        inspired, autonomous modern author—ironically took on the most unlikely of roles: the ghost writer. 
                        Not that Wordsworth would have conceived of it as such, as the term wouldn’t be coined until the 1920s and the 
                        lack of an earlier equivalent suggests what we call “ghost-writing” had yet to be codified in taxonomies of 
                        authorship.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Although the <title level="m">OED</title> dates the earliest use of 
                            “ghost writer” to 1927, Graves Glenwood Clark seems to self-consciously coin the term a few years earlier 
                            in “The Ghost Writer and His Story,” <title level="m">The Editor: The Journal of Information for Literary 
                                Workers</title> 52.4 (25 Feb. 1920), 145. Surprisingly little has been published on the history of 
                            ghost-writing. It appears, however, to have emerged as a byproduct of the professionalization of authorship 
                            during the late eighteenth century. Samuel Johnson was among the first major authors to specialize in the 
                            craft, ghost-writing at least twenty-eight sermons (only two of which, however, were published). See James 
                            Gray, <title level="m">Johnson’s Sermons: A Study</title> (Oxford: Oxford UP, 1972), 7–10.</note> However 
                        anachronistic the label, though, Wordsworth’s unacknowledged and deliberately obscured contributions to 
                        <title level="m">Select Views</title> clearly exemplify ghost-writing as recently defined by John C. Knapp and 
                        Azalea M. Hulbert: “the writing of material by one person (the writer) for use by another (the client) who will 
                        be credited with its authorship, and where both parties agree that the writer’s role will be invisible to readers 
                        or hearers of the words.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Knapp and Hulbert, <title level="m">Ghostwriting and

                    <p>Although no surviving records detail what Wordsworth was to write or his agreed-upon deadlines and fees, he clearly 
                        had two basic assignments. First, he was to compose a general survey of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire, 
                        the three Lakeland counties featured in Wilkinson’s sketches. For this part of the letterpress, he was under no 
                        obligation to reference specific drawings, which meant he could compose it while Wilkinson’s sketches were being 
                        engraved. Then, once proofs of the prints were available, his second task would be providing “appropriate 
                        Letter-press Descriptions” of the specific scenes the artist had depicted. Presumably, what Wilkinson had in 
                        mind—and what Wordsworth ultimately failed to deliver—were the brief notes, which could be as short as a sentence 
                        or as long as several paragraphs, that were increasingly desired by purchasers wishing to learn more about the 
                        distinctive qualities or histories of the series’ featured sites. Such descriptions were fast becoming the norm 
                        in Ackermann sets, and, tellingly, Wilkinson’s one later series, <title level="m">The Architectural Remains of 
                            the Ancient Town and Borough of Thetford</title> (1822), featured conventional examples of the genre

                    <p>Unsurprisingly, Wordsworth’s enthusiasm and output corresponded directly to the relative independence these 
                        particular tasks afforded. After likely accepting Wilkinson’s commission sometime in the latter half of June 1809, 
                        he made little headway over a summer spent entertaining house guests. As Dorothy Wordsworth informed De 
                        Quincey on 1 August, William had “not done anything of late, indeed we have had so much company that it was 
                        scarcely possible for him to feel sufficiently independent to devote himself to composition.”<note place="foot" 
                            resp="editors"><title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:364.</note> Yet, once their visitors departed, Wordsworth 
                        dove into the project with considerable energy. Writing her friend Catherine Clarkson on 18 November, 
                        Dorothy reports that Sara Hutchinson—the sister of William's wife, Mary, and a current member 
                        of the household—was “transcribing the 
                        introduction to a collection of prints to be published by Mr. Wilkinson of Thetford (of which I believe you know 
                        the history as your husband’s name is down among those of the subscribers).” Although William had “only finished 
                        the general introduction, being unable to do the rest till he has seen the prints,” Dorothy was already prepared to  
                        anoint this earliest version of the <title level="m">Guide</title> “the only regular and I may say 
                        <emph>scientific</emph> account of the present and past state and appearance of the country that has yet 
                        appeared.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"><title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:372.</note></p>
                    <p>Less surprising than her enthusiastic appraisal is Dorothy’s uncharacteristically understated report of her 
                        brother having thus far “only” finished his introduction. By any objective standard, William set a remarkably brisk 
                        pace in drafting an 18,000-word, meticulously researched, and vividly rendered section that, when set in type, 
                        became the 34-page “Introduction” serialized over the first eight months of 1810  (pp. 1–34 of the 
                        <ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/1810-letterpress-scans">letterpress</ref> and paras. 1–56 of 
                        <ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.1810.html">our transcription</ref>). This initial 
                        task completed, however, his pace slowed to a crawl. He would ultimately need the entire year between 
                        November 1809 and November 1810 to supply the “descriptions” that, once set in type, filled a mere twelve pages 
                        (pp. 35–46 / para. 57–75). Part of the problem, as Dorothy implied in November 1809, was that the momentum he 
                        established in completing the introduction was lost while awaiting the prints he was expected to describe.</p>

                    <p>The spotty archival record chronicles the mounting frustrations that soured Wordsworth and Wilkinson’s 
                        relationship over the course of 1810. Whereas Dorothy had signaled their enduring enthusiasm for the project 
                        the previous November, the next surviving mention of <title level="m">Select Views</title>, in William’s 10 
                        May 1810 letter to Lady Margaret Beaumont 
                        (<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.letters.html#letter6">letter 6</ref>), reveals how 
                        repugnant the task had become. Addressing a correspondent who, while a close friend, outranked him both in 
                        society and the world of visual arts, Wordsworth preemptively—and gracelessly—distances his letterpress from 
                        Wilkinson’s “drawings, or Etchings, or whatever they may be called.” He fully expects that, upon perusing 
                        Wilkinson’s “intolerable” sketches, Lady Beaumont and her artist husband, Sir George, “will receive from them 
                        that sort of disgust which I do from bad Poetry, a disgust which can never be felt in its full strength, but 
                        by those who are practised in an art, as well as Amateurs of it.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                    <p>While no extant letters offer Wilkinson’s side of the story, the collaboration likely left him 
                        similarly exasperated. Various manuscript fragments show that the slapdash “descriptions” Wordsworth submitted 
                        during the first half of 1810 made no concerted effort to align with Wilkinson’s sketches. Worse, Wordsworth 
                        assumed a peremptory tone toward his putative employer, scrawling at the top of one manuscript, “Herewith is 
                        matter for two more numbers; I shall send for two additional ones in a couple of days. – You will probably judge 
                        best to print matter for two numbers with each month as [you] have only six months before you, and your numbers 
                        are 12.” Wilkinson unsurprisingly balked at printing whatever scraps Wordsworth sent him, instructing the writer 
                        to condense and combine material originally submitted as “Section 2: On the best approach to the Lakes, &amp;c.” 
                        and “Section 3d: Donnerdale continued &amp;c. &amp;c.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">See DCMS 68.3A and 68.3D 
                            at the Wordsworth Trust. Both manuscripts are undated and in Sara Hutchinson’s hand, with Wordsworth’s note 
                            to Wilkinson (“Herewith is matter for two more numbers . . . ”) superimposed over the header for “Section 2.” 
                            In his 1993 supplement to the Wordsworths’ <title level="m">Letters</title>, Alan G. Hill tentatively dates 
                            William’s note on DCMS 68.3A to early March 1810, since his amanuensis, Sara Hutchinson, moved to her 
                            brother’s home in Wales in mid-March. Yet, in mentioning that Wilkinson had “only six months before you,” 
                            Wordsworth presumably meant that, while six of the twelve monthly instalments (i.e., Jan.–June) had 
                            shipped, six (i.e., July–Dec.) remained. If this reading is correct, he sent his manuscript and the inscribed 
                            note to Wilkinson sometime between late May (when the June installment was in print) and mid-June (before 
                            July’s was complete). This would confirm Hill’s alternate theory that Hutchinson copied the manuscript 
                            before leaving in mid-March and Wordsworth added his note later, when he “judged the moment right to send 
                            Wilkinson more copy” (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 8:20).</note> Referencing this request, Wordsworth 
                        reported in a 22 July letter to his wife, Mary, that Dorothy “has been so good as to abridge the sheets I wrote 
                        for Wilkinson[;] for my own part I have no longer any interest in the thing; so he must make what he can of them; 
                        as I can not do the thing in my own way I shall merely task myself with getting through it with the least 
                        trouble" (<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.letters.html#letter7">letter 7</ref>).<note

                        number of <title level="m">Select Views</title>, forming the first half of the hodge-podge labelled “Section II” at 
                        the end of the letterpress (pp. 37–46).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For the serialization dates for specific

                            this edition.</note> That task completed, the Wordsworths put off drafting the second half of “Section II” 
                        until mid-November. Writing Catherine Clarkson on 12 November 1810, Dorothy reports that “not being permitted to 
                        follow his own course” had proven so “irksome” to William that he had “employed me to compose a description or 
                        two for the finishing of his work for Wilkinson.” With trademark self-deprecation, she notes, “I daresay you 
                        will find this latter part very flat.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"><title level="m">Letters</title>, 
                            2:449.</note> Meanwhile, on the other end, Wilkinson and Ackermann were left in the lurch by Wordsworth’s 
                        recalcitrance and procrastination. After apparently receiving no new material from the writer in 
                        October, they shipped the penultimate November number without any letterpress pages. And, with Dorothy still 
                        dashing off descriptions in mid-November, they may well have anticipated needing to write the concluding paragraphs 
                        of “Section II” themselves in order to send some semblance of a completed letterpress with the final installment due 
                        to ship by month’s end.</p></div>

                    <p>Consequently, it must have been with at least partly gritted teeth that, in inscribing Wordsworth’s copy of 
                        <title level="m">Select Views</title> soon thereafter, Wilkinson signed himself the poet’s “faithful, and 
                        Obliged Friend” (fig. 8). The delivery of this presentation copy is the last known interaction of any sort between 
                        the two. That, a decade later, members of Wordsworth’s household felt at least some lingering animus is suggested 
                        by Sara Hutchinson’s 1820 jibe that “Wm’s Preface to Wilkinson’s [series was] the only part of the Publication

                                exactly as it had appeared in 1810 (i.e., no revisions, same font and page layout, identical pagination).

                        nor consult the poet about these reissues, he apparently wasn’t alone in foregoing such courtesies. For, while 
                        Dorothy conceded in November 1809 that any repurposing of her brother’s texts would need to wait until 
                        <title level="m">Select Views</title> had had “its fair run,” there is no evidence of Wordsworth’s either securing 
                        permission to republish the material copyrighted under Wilkinson’s name or notifying him of the three revisions of 
                        the <title level="m">Select Views</title> letterpress he published before the artist’s 1831 death.</p>

                            parallel-text chart</ref> illustrates, the quarter-century Wordsworth ultimately spent revising the 
                        <title level="m">Guide</title> off and on rendered an 1835 text that is markedly different from the 1810 original. 
                        Of the fifth edition’s 139 paragraphs, only 56 originated in <title level="m">Select Views</title>, and most of 
                        these were meaningfully altered in intervening editions. Yet, perhaps the most dramatic changes to the 
                        <title level="m">Guide</title> between 1810 and 1835 were external rather than internal. The earliest readers of 
                        Wordsworth’s essay would have encountered it in heavy tomes that gathered and bound all twelve installments of the 
                        folio-sized engravings and letterpress pages from Wilkinson’s series.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Most 
                            collectors would have set aside the monthly installments of <title level="m">Select Views</title> either at

                            uniformity of surviving copies, which generally include all 48 engravings and follow the order prescribed on 
                            Wilkinson’s contents page (which shipped with the final number). For details on binding practices during this

                        laid flat, a bound copy of <title level="m">Select Views</title> measures approximately 20” x 27.25” (508 x 692mm), 
                        or roughly the size of the average desk’s working surface. Factor in its 7.5-pound (3.4 kg) weight, and it is 
                        difficult to imagine many readers perusing Wordsworth’s letterpress while walking the fells or traveling in 
                        cramped stagecoaches to the Lakes. Once emancipated from <title level="m">Select Views</title>, however, 
                        Wordsworth’s essay would have been read and used in myriad new contexts. As illustrated below in figure 9, the 
                        books in which the earliest versions of the <title level="m">Guide</title> appeared gradually shrunk from the 
                        unwieldy Wilkinson folio of 1810, to the comparatively portable <title level="m">River Duddon</title> octavo of 
                        1820, and finally to the pocket-sized duodecimo of 1822 (the basic size retained for the 1823 and 1835 editions). 
                        And, at 7 ounces (203 g), the 1835 edition weighed a full 7 pounds less than bound copies of

                    <p>Although, as we have seen, in November 1809 the Wordsworth siblings were already imagining that William’s draft 
                        introduction for Wilkinson might be refashioned as the “prefix” to his own “Guide to the Lakes,” eleven years 
                        would elapse before he would publish an abridged and revised version under his own name as the “annex” to his 
                        1820 sonnet collection, <title level="m">The River Duddon</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Between 1809 
                            and 1812, Wordsworth returned to key themes from <title level="m">Select Views</title> in two essays known

                            1813 appointment as Distributor of Stamps gave him the financial freedom to return to poetry. Core ideas

                        pristine, Wordsworth hand-wrote many of his revisions directly into the bound set he had received from 
                        Wilkinson (fig. 10).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Based on evidence he deems “neither abundant nor direct, 
                            but sufficient,” Reed suggests Wordsworth was “very probably back at work on a guide again, motivated by 
                            financial objectives, around November 1812” (<title level="m">Middle Years</title>, 673–75).</note> Besides 
                        cutting several lengthy passages and expunging all references to Wilkinson and his etchings, Wordsworth retitled 
                        his essay “A Topographical Description of the Country of the Lakes in the North of England,” combined “Section I” 
                        and “Section II” from the first edition, and added new passages on the gracefulness and beauty of the Lakes, 
                        travelers’ typical reactions to the region’s mountains, and the damage “improvers” had recently inflicted upon 
                        estates at Derwentwater and Windermere (fig. 11).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For more details on

                    <p>Even though sales for <title level="m">The River Duddon</title> proved unremarkable, it became Wordsworth’s 
                        most extensively reviewed book to date, and those reviewers who noticed the “Topographical Description” were 
                        unfailingly positive.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Of the 500 copies printed in 1820, 340 sold in the first

                            remaindered in 1834. See W. J. B. Owen, <title level="a">Cost, Sales, and Profits of Longman’s Editions of

                            (Oct. 1820), 143.</note> Encouraged by this praise, Wordsworth soon made the decisive step of developing his 
                        essay into a full-fledged guidebook for Lake District travelers (fig. 12). The stand-alone third edition, 
                        titled <title level="m">A Description of the Scenery in the North of England</title>, appeared in June 1822 as 
                        a portable octavo that was widely advertised and reasonably priced at 5s. 6d. New traveler-friendly features 
                        included a fold-out map, notes on the climate, “Directions and Information for the Tourist,” and an account of 
                        an ascent up Scafell Pike that, while written by Dorothy, appears as if by her brother. Wordsworth also added 
                        a section comparing his native region’s mountains and the Alps as part of a larger effort to “reconcile a Briton 
                        to the scenery of his own country, though not at the expense of truth.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                        commercial formula, as the 1822 guidebook sold as rapidly as any Wordsworth title to date, save

                    <p>Rather than simply reissuing the successful 1822 edition, Wordsworth chose yet again to revise and expand his text 
                        for the next edition that appeared in June 1823. Retaining his title from 1822, this fourth edition added 5,400 
                        words of content, including further comparisons of the Lake District and the Alps and new passages on water 
                        birds, weather patterns, and the distinctive glories of the four seasons in the Lakes. By far the longest 
                        addition, however, was another of Dorothy’s unpublished travel accounts, this one chronicling the siblings’ 
                        1805 excursion to Ullswater. Adding yet another chapter to the history of ghost-writing in the 
                        <title level="m">Guide</title>, Wordsworth appended this new account to the Scafell Pike narrative he had 
                        borrowed from Dorothy in 1822 and presented both as his own work. Even with these supplemental features, the 
                        thousand-copy print run for the 1823 edition proved overly optimistic. With hundreds of copies on hand after 
                        the initial sales wave, Wordsworth’s publisher, Longman, would end up advertising this as a “New Edition” of 
                        Wordsworth’s guidebook near the beginning of every summer travel season between 1823 and 1833 (fig. 13).<note

                    <p>After finally clearing out his stock of the 1823 edition in 1835, Longman understandably had little appetite for 
                        a new edition.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Wordsworth netted an underwhelming £62.12.10 from the 1,500 copies 
                            of the 1822 and 1823 editions. Longman’s account books show 468 copies of the <title level="m">Guide</title> 
                            selling in 1822, 113 in 1824, and 169 in 1825. Excepting 1829, when 120 copies sold, the publisher moved 
                            between 33 and 85 per year between 1826 and 1835. The unusual interest in the <title level="m">Guide</title> 
                            well after its release speaks, in part, to its perceived utility. Most of Wordsworth’s poetry collections 
                            sold several hundred copies in the first two years but fewer than ten copies per year thereafter. See Owen, 
                            <title level="a">Cost, Sales, and Profits,</title> 103.</note> The now 65-year-old Wordsworth, however, was 
                        keen on one last revision of his “Little Book on the Lakes” and sensed that, partly owing to his growing public 
                        stature as a poet, an updated edition would find an audience. Hudson and Nicholson, regional publishers based in 
                        nearby Kendal, shared this view and in short order signed on to replace Longman for the fifth edition. 
                        Explicitly targeting the Lake District traveler, the new publishers rechristened the book <title level="m">A 
                            Guide through the District of the Lakes in the North of England</title> and advertised its 25 July 1835 
                        release exclusively in local newspapers (figs. 14 and 15).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Compared to the 
                            £30 Longman spent on nationwide advertisements for the 1823 edition, Wordsworth’s new publishers set aside 
                            a minuscule £3.14 for advertising the fifth edition. Hudson reported to Wordsworth having advertised the 
                            new edition in six small-town Cumbrian newspapers: the <title level="j">Carlisle Journal</title>, 
                            <title level="j">Carlisle Patriot</title>, <title level="j">Kendal Gazette</title>, <title level="j">Kendal 
                                Mercury</title>, <title level="j">Whitehaven Pacquet</title>, and <title level="j">Whitehaven Herald</title> 
                                    (Wordsworth Trust MS. WLMS 6/9/1). See also Owen, <title level="a">Costs, Sales, and Profits,</title> 
                                    103 and 106.</note> For his part, Wordsworth added ten new paragraphs to the beginning of his 
                        “Directions and Information for the Tourist” and moved this section from the back of the book to the front. 
                        Lest the intent of such alterations be lost on its imagined audience, Hudson and Nicholson’s ads highlighted 
                        how, “in a concise style,” Wordsworth had laid out “the best and most convenient order of visiting the Lakes.” 
                        Better yet, “An Itinerary of Excursions has been added by the Publishers, which will be found of great advantage 
                        to Tourists.”</p>

                    <p>As might be expected, rebranding the <title level="m">Guide</title> as a locally manufactured and distributed 
                        product designed for provincial customers had a chilling effect on sales in the metropolis. Having stayed on as 
                        the new edition’s London distributor, Longman sold a mere 164 copies between 1835 and 1843. Within the Lake 
                        District, however, the fifth edition enjoyed robust sales. Enclosing a royalty check for £29.17.10, Hudson 
                        reported to Wordsworth that, as of 27 September 1838, only 433 of the 1,500 copies printed in 1835 remained 
                        unsold. Imagining unflagging interest in the years ahead, the publisher suggested, “We should be happy to consult 
                        with you sometime when we are at Ambleside on the expediency of having a new &amp; more correct map of the Lake 
                        District, and also of extending the directions to Tourists in the next Edition, which we think would materially 
                        increase the Sale.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Wordsworth Trust MS. WLMS 6/9/1.</note></p>

                    <p>Content at last to leave his essay be, Wordsworth demurred on Hudson’s request for another revision. He would, 
                        however, assist the publishers with “Hudson’s <title level="m">Guide</title>,” the 1842 edition that paired his 
                        and Adam Sedgwick’s studies of the Lakes. Together, this new edition and the tourist-friendly version of 1835 
                        brought into sharp relief the <title level="m">Guide</title>’s previously underappreciated engagement with 
                        earlier landmarks of Lake District travel writing. While people had long lived and labored in the region, before 
                        the mid-eighteenth century the lakes and mountains of England’s northwest attracted few leisure travelers. In fact, 
                        the topography of the Lake District struck many as more forbidding than inviting. Daniel Defoe, writing in the 
                        1720s, claimed that the region was “eminent only for being the wildest, most barren and frightful of any that I 
                        have passed over in England.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Daniel Defoe, <title level="m"> A Tour thro’ the

                            The most comprehensive survey of early books on Lake Country topography remains Peter Bicknell’s 
                            <title level="m">The Picturesque Scenery of the Lake District 1752–1855: A Bibliographical Study</title> 
                            (Winchester: St. Paul’s Bibliographies, 1990). For how Wordsworth’s expanding popularity influenced the 
                            development of Victorian travel literature, see Saeko Yoshikawa’s <title level="m">William Wordsworth and 
                                the Invention of Tourism, 1820–1900</title> (Burlington: Ashgate, 2014), esp. 225–41.</note> By the time 
                        Wordsworth reached adulthood, however, his native Lake District had become one of the most popular landscape 
                        subjects for writers and artists in the British Isles and increasingly a destination for tourists. The Wordsworths 
                        and other locals without an economic stake in the annual summer influx began derisively referring to these 
                        travelers as “Lakers.” At the close of one especially heavy tourism season, an exhausted Dorothy Wordsworth 
                        wrote on 18 October 1825, “I think we had the last of our Lakers on Sunday.”<note place="foot" 
                            resp="editors"><title level="m">Letters</title>, 4:393. “Laker” had been in use since at least 1798, when 
                            James Plumptre wrote <title level="m">The Lakers: A Comic Drama</title>, a gentle satire of Keswick-centered 
                            tourism and the fashion for botany. In 1805, Windermere resident Richard Watson, Bishop of Llandaff, explained 
                            to a friend that “<title level="m">Lakers</title>” was “the denomination by which we distinguish those who 
                            come to see our country.” More specifically, he suggested, it was reserved for “idle persons who love 
                            <emph>laking</emph>” (<title level="m">Anecdotes of the Life of Richard Watson</title>, 2 vols. [London: 
                            Cadell and Davies, 1817], 2:269).</note></p>
                        <p>Like many landscapes prized by latter-day travelers, this one had remained comparatively unspoiled because 
                            earlier generations found it resistant to large-scale cultivation, difficult to traverse, and prone to 
                            unpleasant weather. It was not until modernity arrived, with its sprawling populations and rapid 
                            transportation networks, that Britons began to value “wilderness” for its contrasting spiritual 
                            resources.<note place="foot" resp="editors">We put “wilderness” in quotes because, as Wordsworth was well 
                                aware, the Lake District was hardly an untouched preserve, even before eighteenth-century tourists took 
                                interest in it. Humans had long inhabited and shaped the region. For Wordsworth, then, preserving the 
                                landscape meant holding on to and enhancing its character as produced by traditional ways of life and the 
                                mediating power of taste. Throughout the <title level="m">Guide</title>, readers find significant tension 
                                between “nature” and “culture.” Several scholars listed in our annotated bibliography have addressed this 
                                tension and other complications attending Wordsworth’s environmentalism.</note> In old age, Wordsworth 
                            recalled a Keswick landlady of his youth who lamented, “Bless me! folk are always talking about prospects:

                            to natural scenery, Wordsworth emerged at an ideal moment for capturing nature’s glories in prose and verse. 
                            By 1825, he had come claim that his “wish” in writing the <title level="m">Guide</title> was “to teach the

                    <p>Various imperatives drove the popularization of scenic terrains like those found among the lakes and fells of 
                        Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire. One was national: the so-called “discovery of Britain” reflected a 
                        desire to domesticate the continental Grand Tour, the rite of passage that functioned as the culmination of a 
                        gentleman’s education. The growth of home tourism in the eighteenth century was accelerated both by economic 
                        constraints and European wars. Turning their energies inward, then, by necessity as well as inclination, British 
                        tourists, artists, and travel writers self-consciously went about demarcating their own nation’s classic ground, 
                        including the lesser-known but increasingly romanticized landscapes of Northern England, Scotland, and Wales.</p>
                    <p>Wordsworth thus participated in a broader cultural phenomenon when comparing the Lakeland fells to the Alps and 
                        desiring to “reconcile a Briton to the scenery of his own country” 
                        (<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.1835.html#para106">para. 106</ref>). 
                        While this nativizing project took on fresh urgency during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, it was a 
                        movement long in the making. The early promotion of British landscape had its paradoxical aspects—for instance, 
                        drawing on continental codes of art to celebrate domestic beauties. Yet it set the stage for the time when 
                        tourists would hunger to range over British territory defined as heritage landscape, sped along by expanding 
                        economic opportunity, leisure, and transportation improvements. It is no wonder that most historians of British 
                        travel date the birth of modern tourism to roughly 1750, as this moment witnessed not only the birth of Lake 
                        District literature but also the earliest stirrings of the cult of the picturesque. By the dawn of the Romantic 
                        period, conditions were firmly in place for a boom in British home tourism.</p>
                    <p>Wordsworth both reflects and capitalizes on these trends in the <title level="m">Guide</title>. Repeatedly noting 
                        changes from “within the last sixty years,” he defines a period that wraps his <title level="m">Guide</title>’s 
                        concerns into the history of tourism.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See especially the opening of “Section 
                            Third” in the 1835 edition. In the first edition of 1810, Wordsworth had spoken of events from “within the 
                            last forty years,” making 1770, his birth year, the point of departure. This blurring of regional history 
                            and his own lifespan connected the <title level="m">Guide</title> and the landscape it celebrates to the 
                            biographical myth underlying Wordsworth’s poetic project (see Gill, <title level="m">Life</title>, 285).</note> 
                        The rise of landscape-hunger, with its associated art and literature, fueled tourist traffic that would transform 
                        the Lake District both environmentally and socially. It also encouraged more affluent people to move to or 
                        purchase second homes in the region. Arguably, Wordsworth himself chose to settle in the heart of the Lake 
                        District not only because it was his childhood home and the repository of personal memories but also because it 
                        was rich aesthetic territory. Now, in both the <title level="m">Guide</title> and his poetry, he was taking stock 
                        of the changes that had occurred in his native region, celebrating some but more often sounding defensive and 
                        elegiac notes. While singing the beauties of a place, he also aimed to define and protect it.</p>
                    <p>Despite enduring myths surrounding Wordsworth and his fellow poets’ “discovery” of the Lake District, it had in 
                        fact been widely promoted in print and painting since the 1750s, most prominently in studies by William 
                        Hutchinson (1774), Thomas Gray (1775), Thomas West (1778), William Gilpin (1786), and James Clarke (1787).<note

                        form firm opinions, Wordsworth engaged the tradition directly. While, with his lyrical prose and intimate knowledge

                        might have seemed mildly derivative to readers well versed in, say, Gilpin’s strictures against white objects 
                        disrupting sight lines, West’s characterization of the Lake region as a miniature version of the Alps, and 
                        countless commentaries on the use of color and form in landscapes.</p>

                    <p>The first influential promoters of the region’s scenery were visual artists, but just behind them came the writers 
                        who established foundations for literature on the region. One was John Dalton of Queen’s College, Oxford, who 
                        published <title level="m">A Descriptive Poem Addressed to Two Young Ladies at Their Return from Viewing the Mines 
                            Near Whitehaven</title> in 1755; another was John Brown of St John’s, Cambridge, whose glowing letter on the 
                        Vale of Keswick (written in the early 1750s but first published in 1767) described the area’s scenery in terms 
                        of “the united powers of Claude, Salvator, and Poussin” and attracted many aspiring artists and 
                        scenery-hounds.<note place="foot" resp="editors"><title level="m">A Description of the Lake at Keswick and the

                            J. Ashburner, 1770), 5.</note> As Peter Bicknell observes, with Dalton and Brown both hailing from Cumberland, 
                        it was fitting that they should be the first of the “long line of dons and divines who were to record the 
                        Lakes.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Bicknell, <title level="m">Picturesque Scenery</title>, 1.</note> 
                        Acknowledging such pioneers in the <title level="m">Guide</title>, Wordsworth singled out Brown, calling him “one 
                        of the first who led the way to a worthy admiration of this country”

                        and opining that he worked “with a powerful pencil, and the feeling of a genuine Enthusiast”

                    <p>Even before Wordsworth’s birth, Brown’s letter had found its way into the hands of Thomas Gray and convinced the 
                        famous poet to turn tourist. Gray, best known for his <title level="a">Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard</title> 
                        (1751), made his tour of the Lakes in 1769, two years before his eventual death and fifteen months before 
                        Wordsworth’s birth. Having left a sick traveling companion behind, he kept a careful journal that was first printed 
                        in William Mason’s <title level="m">The Poems of Mr. Gray</title> (1775). Gray’s journal fully entered the canon of 
                        Lakeland literature, however, when republished as an addendum to the second edition of Thomas West’s popular 
                        <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> (1780). Though Gray’s account was often parodied for such superheated 
                        descriptions as that of the “Jaws of Borrowdale,” Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title> praises its prevailing 
                        “distinctness and unaffected simplicity” 
                        (<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.1835.html#para73">para. 73</ref>).<note place="foot"

                            Cockin, who admitted that Gray’s journal offered little of what readers might call “fine writing” but insisted 
                            that those who prized trustworthy description and “elegant simplicity of narrative” would consider it a welcome 
                            companion to their travels (in West, <title level="m">A Guide to the Lakes</title>, 2nd ed. [London: Richardson

                        <title level="a">Preface to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>,</title> Wordsworth found in him a kindred 
                        spirit, a poet of an earlier generation exploring places he now knew and loved. Gray’s journal contained several 
                        passages that Wordsworth would especially approve, such as when he calls Grasmere Vale, Wordsworth’s future home, “a 
                        little unexpected paradise.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Gray, quoted in Thomas West, <title level="m">A Guide

                        also rightly saw Gray’s journal as a major impetus for the growth of Lakeland tourism, attributing its sway in part 
                        to “the pensive interest with which the human mind is ever disposed to listen to the farewell words of genius”

                    <p>Alongside Gray, the most important figures in the background of Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title> were 
                        West and the Reverend William Gilpin. Although unpublished until 1786, Gilpin’s <title level="m">Observations 
                            Relative Chiefly to Picturesque Beauty</title> had circulated broadly in manuscript since 1772 and gained 
                        significant influence. More instruction manual than tour guide, Gilpin’s treatise served as a touchstone for 
                        Wordsworth in the <title level="m">Guide</title> and elsewhere, clearly informing his theories of and vocabulary 
                        for describing the picturesque, though Wordsworth resisted Gilpin’s painterly perspective. Wordsworth’s most 
                        consistent interlocutor in his essay on the Lakes, however, is West, whose own <title level="m">A Guide to the 
                            Lakes</title> (1778) was the undisputed classic on the subject. Before writing his guidebook, West had 
                        already established himself as an authority on the region with <title level="m">The Antiquities of Furness</title> 
                        (1774), and, recognizing that Lake tourism was accelerating, he set out to fill a need. Just how successful 
                        West’s <title level="m">Guide</title> had proven in this aim is evidenced by its going into an eleventh edition 
                        in 1821, the year before Wordsworth’s essay first appeared in a stand-alone volume.</p>
                    <p>Sensibly organized, clear, detailed, and engaging throughout, West’s catalog of the wonders of the Lake District 
                        quickly won admirers. Wordsworth frequently alludes to it approvingly in his <title level="m">Guide</title>, 
                        noting at one point how this earlier “Guide to the Lakes has been eminently serviceable to the Tourist for nearly 
                        50 years” (<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.1835.html#para116">para. 116</ref>). 
                        The first few pages of West’s book indicate its character. 
                        Its epigraph, taken from Milton’s description of Eden, announces a treatise on “A happy rural seat of various 
                        views,” and such “views” of England’s Northern Arcadia would quickly emerge as the work’s main emphasis. Perhaps 
                        most famously, West recommends a series of viewing stations best suited to use of a “landscape mirrors,” or the 
                        “Claude glasses” popular with Gray and other educated travelers whose expectations had been shaped by landscape 
                        art (fig. 17).<note place="foot" resp="editors">West, <title level="m">A Guide to the Lakes</title> (London:

                            landscape sketchers. The device took its name from Claude Lorrain, the seventeenth-century French artist 
                            whose visions of Arcadia heavily shaped British theories of the picturesque. The glass could frame and tint 
                            the landscape so that it resembled one of Claude’s paintings. (Courtesy: Victoria and Albert Museum,

                    <p>After its author’s 1779 death, West’s <title level="m">Guide</title> gradually morphed into an anthology of Lake 
                        District writing in the second (1780) and third (1784) editions overseen by William Cockin (figs. 18 and 19). 
                        Filling some hundred pages of the three hundred-page book, Cockin’s “Addenda” offered a chronologically organized 
                        survey of writing on the Lakes since the 1750s. The collection as a whole treated literary descriptions, 
                        especially poems, as fundamental aides to appreciating the region’s landscapes, inspiring Wordsworth and a host 
                        of others to take up the rhapsodic pen themselves. In the wake of these expanded editions of West’s <title

                    <p>West and his early readers therefore launched a process that the Lake Poets, especially Wordsworth, would 
                        complete, converting the Lake District into a poetic landscape. By framing the region as a series of poems and pictures 
                        and establishing codes for admiring such pictures, West and his contemporaries set patterns that Lake District 
                        tourism still follows in many respects, though catering now to travelers with digital cameras. Nearly 250 years 
                        after West, tourists may still visit some of his viewing “stations,” including most famously Claife Station on 
                        the western shore of Windermere (fig. 20).</p>

                    <p>Clearly, then, Wordsworth did not write in a vacuum, as his essay on the Lakes was highly informed by earlier 
                        guides. Nonetheless, it was novel in several respects. Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title> 
                        embraced the creed that animated his verses, broadcasting his ideals in editions increasingly geared toward the 
                        general reader who might never have taken to his poetry. As witnessed in our 
                        <ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.annotated_bib.html">annotated bibliography</ref>, 
                        commentators on the <title level="m">Guide</title> have long emphasized its uniquely “Wordsworthian” traits. 
                        Whereas earlier guidebooks had typically assumed the tourist’s point of view, Wordsworth’s convinces us its 
                        author has walked all of the region’s paths in all sorts of weather. He belongs to the place almost as much as do 
                        the trees, rocks, lichens, and waterfalls. Characteristically, he blends a native’s matter-of-factness with a 
                        sense of persistent wonder and dignified reverence.</p>
                    <p>Wordsworth also goes beyond the conventional practice of travel handbooks in his range of arguments. As Ian 
                        Ousby suggests, the <title level="m">Guide</title> “makes most [earlier travel books] seem ‘two-dimensional’ by 
                        its larger, more rounded approach to its subject, treating landscape not as a special effect to be sought out and 
                        appreciated in isolation but connecting it to the region’s geology, history, and human culture.”<note place="foot"

                                Views</title>, Wordsworth explained to Lady Beaumont on 10 May 1810 that he aspired to “give a model of 
                        the manner in which topographical descriptions ought to be executed . . . by evolving truly and distinctly one 
                        appearance from another” (<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.letters.html#letter6">letter 
                            6</ref>).<note place="foot" resp="editors"><title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:404.</note> Honoring this 
                        original intent, all iterations of the <title level="m">Guide</title> insist that travelers experience the Lake 
                        District as it unfolds itself gradually to the pedestrian. Against the tradition of viewing the region merely as 
                        a series of discrete viewing stations, Wordsworth presents it as a whole that takes its charms from interconnection 
                        and gradual transition, both physical and temporal. The Lake District may offer no single feature superior to, say, 
                        a high peak in the Alps, but as a compact <emph>whole</emph>, it compares favorably with any terrain in the world. 
                        Embodying Coleridge’s concept of beauty as “multeity in unity,” the region is a poem in which the parts take their 
                        meaning from the overall scheme. This understanding has ecological significance. All aspects of Lake Country 
                        life—aesthetic, meteorological, social, agricultural, geological, biological—are taken to be interrelated.</p>
                    <p>Even in radically repurposing what began as the prose supplement to an esoteric art series into a portable traveler’s 
                        companion, Wordsworth never saw himself writing a mere guidebook. Straightaway in the 1835 edition he begrudges the 
                        “humble and tedious task” of providing directions for tourists, aspiring instead to influence “the 
                        <emph>Minds</emph> of Persons of taste, and a feeling for Landscape,” sensitive souls prepared to watch and 
                        receive with uncommon attention 
                        (<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.1835.html#para1">para. 1</ref>). 
                        Tellingly, the word “guide” never 
                        appeared in the work’s title until it became important to Hudson and Nicholson’s marketing of the fifth 
                        edition. <title level="m">Description</title>, Wordsworth’s chosen label for the second, third, and fourth 
                        editions, was in ways more accurate, though the <title level="m">Guide</title> never confines its task to merely 
                        “describing” the region.</p>
                    <p>Another feature distinguishing Wordsworth’s essay from its forerunners is the pioneering case it makes for preserving 
                        the ecological, aesthetic, and social health of the Lake District. Even while promoting the region’s charms, it 
                        conveys a fear that newcomers may love the region to death. As noted above, Wordsworth writes as a Lake District 
                        local, but he also writes <emph>to</emph> locals—especially to wealthy landowners who have recently arrived. The 
                        title page of the 1835 edition advertises this as a book “for the use of Tourists and Residents,” and all 
                        stand-alone versions included the bluntly subtitled section on “Changes, and Rules of Taste for Preventing their 
                        Bad Effects.” Whether descanting on the ideal color for homes, the traditional shape of vernacular chimneys, or 
                        the sensible placement of trees, Wordsworth often takes a view that transcends the limits of private property. 
                        He argues that, in a special moral sense, the countryside belongs to everyone, regardless of who might legally own 
                        a particular corner of it. Most famously, his pronouncement that the Lake District should be regarded as “a sort 
                        of national property, in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy” 
                        (<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.1835.html#para93">para. 93</ref>) offers an original 
                        vision for the idea of the national 
                        park.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On Wordsworth as founding figure for national parks, see Stephen Gill, 
                            <title level="m">Wordsworth and the Victorians</title> (Oxford: Clarendon, 1998), 260.</note> This passage would inspire the founders of Britain’s National Trust, 
                        early proponents of national parks in Britain and America, and the 1951 establishment of Lake District National 
                        Park, the largest designated region in England and now a UNESCO World Heritage site. As Peter Bicknell suggests, 
                        “whether we agree with [Wordsworth] or not, he has fundamentally changed the way we all look at the natural 
                        world.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Bicknell, <title level="m">Illustrated Wordsworth’s Guide to the

                    <p>In gradually reworking and repurposing his <title level="m">Guide</title>, Wordsworth came to consider it less  
                        an autonomous work than part of his larger literary and philosophical project. Where other topographical writers 
                        might refer to a painting, Wordsworth usually quotes poetry, not infrequently his own.<note place="foot" 
                            resp="editors">See Julia S. Carlson, <title level="a"><foreign xml:lang="fr">Prose Mesurée</foreign> in the

                                    Romantic Review</title> 20, no. 2 (April 2009): 227–36.</note> Throughout the 
                        <title level="m">Guide</title>, he imports verse not merely for vanity or ornamentation; rather, he grasps for the most 
                        evocative language at hand, whether in the form of a lyric, a passage from the <title level="m">Excursion</title>, 
                        or a few lines from such unpublished works as “Home at Grasmere” or <title level="m">The Prelude</title>. In so 
                        doing, Wordsworth insists that poetry is an authoritative mode of description. His quotations become both 
                        illustrations and occasions for heightened focus. Sometimes they also model emotional reactions, encouraging 
                        readers to translate the writer’s observations into the realms of personal sensation and reflection.</p>
                    <p>Within the larger history of travel writing, the <title level="m">Guide</title> also expands the trend of blending poetry with topographical 
                        prose. By Victorian times, this potent combination would not only make reading poetry essential to travelers’ 
                        landscape explorations but would also produce a thoroughly literary geography, converting the Lake District into 
                        the “Wordsworthshire” of literary tourists.<note place="foot" resp="editors">“Wordsworthshire” seems to have been 
                            coined by Harvard professor James Russell Lowell (see the unsigned biographical sketch he contributed 
                            to <title level="m">The Poetical Works of William Wordsworth</title> [7 vols., Boston: Little, Brown, and 
                            Company, 1854, xxxviii], material later reworked as <title level="a">Wordsworth</title> in 
                            <title level="m">Among My Books</title>, 2nd Series [Boston: James R. Osgood, 1876, 240]). However, the term 
                            is essentially synonymous with “Wordsworth Country” and other common designations of the Lake District’s 
                            literary landscape that developed across the nineteenth and into the early twentieth century. Compare 
                            “Scott-land,” “Burns Country,” and similar inventions of the Victorian travel and literary heritage 
                            industries.</note> After all, Wordsworth’s self-quotation performs anthology-making functions, making it 
                        difficult to disentangle the long-range impact of his <title level="m">Guide</title> from the reverberations of 
                        his poems. In the end, Wordsworth, his verses, and the terrain he celebrated became inseparable in the public 
                        imagination. The increasing popularity of Wordsworth’s poetry from the 1820s through the 1840s mirrored, and 
                        probably owed something to, the growing accessibility of the Lake District as tourist terrain. Meanwhile, this 
                        tourism, abetted by marketing savvy on the poet’s and his publishers’ parts, helped consolidate Wordsworth’s 
                        Victorian authorial persona.</p>
                    <p>Considering the wide-ranging impact the <title level="m">Guide</title> has had on literary and environmental 
                        thought over its first two-plus centuries, there’s ample cause for gratitude that Joseph Wilkinson turned up in 
                        the spring of 1809 with an offer that at last persuaded Wordsworth to overcome his anxieties about doing justice to 
                        “a theme so boundless and sublime as this beautiful region” 
                        (<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.letters.html#letter2">letter 2</ref>).<note place="foot"

                        earliest incarnation, the resulting essay still impresses with its earnest affection for its subject. There are moments 
                        in the <title level="m">Guide</title> when the literature of knowledge modulates into the literature of power: striking 
                        metaphors; accounts of the "magical" effects of reflection, light and mist; expeditions into the clouds; and even 
                        excursions back in time. Other passages dwell on the small and often overlooked—lichens, wildflowers, ferns, 
                        gravel. Such descriptions capture in prose the “poetry of nature” for which Wordsworth remains beloved. In short, the book 
                        promotes "imagination," defined by Wordsworth in his note to <title level="a">The Thorn</title> as “the faculty which 
                        produces impressive effects out of simple elements.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">The “poetry of nature” phrase 
                            originates in Coleridge’s account of the genesis of <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>: “During the first year that Mr. Wordsworth 
                            and I were neighbours, our conversations turned frequently on the two cardinal points of poetry, the power of 
                            exciting the sympathy of the reader by a faithful adherence to the truth of nature, and the power of giving the 
                            interest of novelty by the modifying colours of imagination. The sudden charm, which accidents of light and shade, 
                            which moonlight or sunset diffused over a known and familiar landscape, appeared to represent the practicability 
                            of combining both. These are the poetry of nature” (<title level="m">Biographia Literaria</title>, [London: Rest 
                            Penner, 1817], vol. 2, 1). For Wordsworth’s discussion of “imagination” in the note to <title level="a">The

                        inviting visitors to read the landscape as they have learned to read Wordsworth’s poems.</p>
                    <p>Of course, the history of the <title level="m">Guide</title>’s influence hardly ends with the editions published 
                        during his lifetime. Victorian guidebooks commonly referenced it, so that many of its principles, absorbed and 
                        ultimately taken for granted, came to affect readers indirectly. Lake District tourism and its associated 
                        literature continued to grow rapidly after the poet’s death, encouraged by improved transportation to the 
                        gateway towns, the emergence of photography, and the unflagging enthusiasm of many writers, walkers, tour 
                        promoters, artists, and conservationists, notable Wordsworthians among them. While Wordsworth would have been 
                        pleased by the expansion of his reputation and influence, he likely would have felt some discomfort about the 
                        commercialization of “Wordsworth Country.” Late in his life, he had famously protested the construction of the 
                        Kendal and Windermere Railway, fearing that mass tourism would degrade the Lake District’s “character of 
                        seclusion and retirement.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">See his letters to the <title level="j">Morning

                    <p>Yet, despite the irony of a man so skeptical of tourism writing 
                        a guidebook, Wordsworth had a lifelong passion for introducing others to the beauties of his native region and 
                        a growing awareness of how his works helped produce the demand for tourist infrastructure. While his second 
                        railway letter reminded the coming hordes that “there are temples of Nature, temples built by the Almighty, 
                        which have . . . claim to be left unviolated,” he never expected or desired to keep the Lakes to 
                        himself.<note place="foot" resp="editors"><title level="m">Kendal and Windermere Railway</title>, 19.</note> In 
                        candid moments he may even have appreciated the synchronicity of the railway and his appointment as Poet 
                        Laureate arriving together in the 1840s. He would now have to accept the crowds at Windermere along with his fan 
                        mail and the pilgrims finding their way to Rydal Mount—all natural consequences of an appreciative 
                        readership. <title level="m">The Guide</title> thus leaves us with a paradox, and it may be said to have come up 
                        short in some of its rhetorical aims. Still, signs of the impact of Wordsworth’s taste-shaping efforts, his 
                        conservation ethic, and his love of nature abound even now in the Lake District and beyond.</p>
