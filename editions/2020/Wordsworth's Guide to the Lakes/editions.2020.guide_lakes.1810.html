               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>As detailed in this edition’s <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.introduction.html#para8">introduction</a> (esp. paras. 8–18), the essay now known as William Wordsworth’s <em>Guide to the Lakes</em> initially appeared as the anonymous letterpress to <em>Select Views of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire</em>, a collection of forty-eight sketches of Lake District landscapes by the Reverend
                     Joseph Wilkinson. Marketed primarily to affluent collectors, printed on high-end folio
                     paper, and distributed by leading art publisher Rudolph Ackermann, <em>Select Views</em> was, as Wordsworth remarked in 1820, “an expensive work, and necessarily of limited
                     circulation.”
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                              (1)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>From Wordsworth’s preface to the “2nd edition” of the Guide, which he retitled 
                              “Topographical Description of the Country of the Lakes”
                              and appended to his River Duddon collection of 1820 (p. 214).</span></div>
                     </div> Though the poet would repeatedly rework his essay over the next quarter century, the
                     1810 text remained its heart. This is readily seen in our <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/imported/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.paralleltext.pdf">parallel-text comparison</a>, which tracks his extensive changes and additions over the four subsequent editions
                     of the <em>Guide</em> published under his name between 1820 and 1835.</p>
               </div> 
               <p class="noCount">In accepting the <em>Select Views</em> commission, Wordsworth had two distinct assignments. The first, offering a general
                  survey of the Lake District, was fulfilled by his 34-page 
                  “introduction”
                  (paras. 1–56 below). The second, describing vistas or landmarks featured in Wilkinson’s
                  sketches, proved considerably more vexing for reasons explained in our <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.introduction.html#para18">introduction</a> (paras. 18–23). Ultimately, the fragmentary “descriptions” Wordsworth submitted (
                  “Section I: Of the Best Time for Visiting the Lakes”
                  [para. 57 below] and the untitled 
                  “Section II”
                  [paras. 58–75]) only obliquely reference the Wilkinson drawings that occasioned the
                  series.</p> 
               <p class="noCount">The transcription that follows of this “first edition” of Wordsworth’s <em>Guide</em> retains all spelling, punctuation, and paragraphing of <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/guide_lakes/1810-letterpress-scans">the 1810 letterpress</a>, including obvious printer’s errors (e.g., “rood” for “road,” “tress” for “trees,”
                  “assent” for “ascent,” “as top” for “a stop”), variant spellings (especially of place
                  names), and occasional stylistic oddities. Unsurprisingly, typographical mistakes
                  were most frequent in Section II, which had to be rushed to press as a result of Wordsworth’s
                  dilatory submission of his final manuscript pages (see <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.introduction.html#para19">introduction</a>, paras. 19–23).</p> 
               <p class="noCount">Our lone editorial addition is paragraph numbers, which we include for convenience
                  in locating and citing specific passages. All page-break markers are hyperlinked to
                  the corresponding page of the 1810 letterpress and use Arabic enumeration rather than
                  the seemingly accidental blend of Roman and Arabic pagination in the original. A fuller
                  account of the commissioning, composition, and serialization of <em>Select Views</em> can be found in our general <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.introduction.html">introduction</a> to this edition and <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.serialpublication.html">Appendix 1</a>.

            <p class="noCount">The busy scenes in which you have been so long and so honourably engaged, have not
               been able to divert your mind from literature and the arts. You have cultivated a
               genuine taste for the sublime and beautiful, and for the tranquil pleasures of rural
               retirement, amid the turbulence of political life; which is apt in minds less happily
               disposed, to abstract the attention from objects of more humble but more soothing
               and more elegant pursuit.</p>
            <p class="noCount">With the varied scenes, which are delineated in the present work, you are well acquainted;
               and to your retentive memory and just discrimination, I can, therefore, with some
               confidence appeal for the accuracy of the representations. You, dear Sir, have frequently
               approved and encouraged the efforts of my pencil; and it was your suggestion, which
               excited the first idea of publishing a selection of my views.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The present Etchings exhibit a faithful resemblance of the original Sketches, and
               I hope that the Sketches themselves have caught not only the general features, but
               the animation and the spirit of the scenery of Cumberland, Westmoreland and Lancashire.
               I was for many years a resident in the most picturesque part of the North. Many of
               these views are therefore endeared to me by numerous recollections of past times;
               but I trust that the soft and the smiling, the wild and the rugged features with which
               they are <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/0-4-Dedication%202.jpg">[Dedication p. 2]</a> blended, will render them interesting to the general beholder, who may not have seen
               the original landscapes; and in whom they excite no tender and sensitive associations.</p>
            <p class="noCount">In executing the Sketches themselves, I have passed many delightful hours, some of
               which I have lived over again in preparing the present work for publication. I should
               disguise my real sentiments, if I did not acknowledge that I am anxious for the success
               of this expensive undertaking, but whatever may be its reception, I cannot with-hold
               my grateful acknowledgements to the numerous and respectable list of Subscribers by
               whom it has been supported, and more particularly to you, whose many acts of kindness
               and of friendship on this, and on other occasions, have made a deep and lasting impression
               on the mind of, dear Sir,</p>

               <h1><span class="head">INTRODUCTION.</span></h1>
            </header>
            <p>At Lucerne in Switzerland there existed some years ago, and perhaps does still exist,
               a model of a large portion of the Alpine country encompassing the lake of the four
               Cantons. The spectator ascended a little platform and saw Mountains, Lakes, Glaciers,
               Rivers, Woods, Waterfalls, and Vallies, with their Cottages and every other object
               which they contained, lying at his feet; all things being represented in their exact
               proportions and appropriate colours. It may be easily conceived that this exhibition
               afforded an exquisite delight to the imagination, which was tempted to wander from
               valley to valley, from mountain to mountain, at will through the deepest recesses
               of the Alps. But it supplied also a more solid and substantial pleasure; for the sublime
               and beautiful region, with all its hidden treasures and their relations and bearings
               to each other, was thereby comprehended and <em>understood</em> at once.</p>
            <p>Something of this kind (as far as can be performed by words, which must needs be most
               inadequately) will be attempted in the following introductory pages, with reference
               to the country which has furnished the subjects of the Drawings now offered to the
               public, adding to a verbal representation of its permanent features such appearances
               as are transitory from their dependence upon accidents of season and weather. This,
               if tolerably executed, will in some instances communicate to the traveller, who has
               already seen the objects, new information; and will assist him to give to his recollections
               a more orderly arrangement than his own opportunities of observing may have permitted
               him to do; while it will be still more useful to the future traveller by directing
               his attention at once to distinctions in things which, without such previous aid,
               a length of time only could enable him to discover. And, as must be obvious, this
               general introduction will combine with the Etchings certain notices of things which,
               though they may not lie within the province of the pencil, cannot but tend to render
               its productions more interesting; especially in a case like the present, where a work
               wishes to recommend itself by a twofold claim, viz. by furnishing pleasing Sketches,
               and at the same time accurate Portraits of those scenes from which they are taken.</p>
            <p>To begin then with the main demarkation of the Country, I know not how I can give
               the reader a more distinct image of this than by requesting him to place himself in
               imagination upon some given point; let it be the top of either of the <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/2.jpg">[p. 2]</a> mountains of Great Gavel or Scawfell; or rather let him suppose his station to be
               a cloud hanging midway between the two mountains, at not more than half a mile’s distance
               from the summit of each, and but a few yards above their highest elevation, he will
               then see stretched at his feet a number of Vallies, not fewer than nine, diverging
               from the point, on which he is supposed to stand, like spokes from the nave of a wheel.
               First he will note, lying to the south east, the Vale of Langdale which will conduct
               his eye to the long Lake of Winandermere stretching, as appears, nearly to the sea,
               or rather to the sands of the vast Bay of Morecamb, which here serves for the rim
               of this imaginary wheel, trace it in a direction from the south east towards the south,
               and he will next fix his eyes upon the Vale of Coniston running up likewise from the
               sea, but not (as all the other vallies do) to the station which I have considered
               as the nave of the wheel; and therefore it may not be inaptly represented as a broken
               spoke sticking in the rim. Looking forth again, with an inclination towards the west,
               immediately at our feet lies the Vale of Duddon, in which is no Lake but a copious
               river winding among fields, rocks, and mountains, and terminating its course in the
               Sands of Duddon. The fourth valley which we shall next observe, viz. that of Eskdale,
               is of the same general character as the last, yet beautifully discriminated from it
               by features which, in the more minute details attached to the several parts of this
               work, will hereafter be described. Next, almost due west, look down upon and into
               the deep Valley of Wastdale with its little chapel and half a dozen neat scattered
               dwellings, a plain of meadow and corn ground intersected with stone walls apparently
               innumerable, like a large piece of lawless patch-work, or an array of mathematical
               figures, such as in the ancient schools of geometry might have been sportively and
               fantastically traced out upon sand. Beyond this little fertile plain lies, within
               its bed of steep mountains, the long, narrow, stern, and desolate Lake of Wastdale;
               and beyond this a dusky tract of level ground conducts the eye to the Irish Sea. The
               several Vales of Ennerdale and Buttermere, with their Lakes, next present themselves;
               and lastly the Vale of Borrodale, of which that of Keswick is only a continuation,
               stretching due north, brings us to a point nearly opposite to the Vale of Winandermere
               with which we began. From this it will appear that the image of a wheel, which I have
               made use of, and which is thus far exact, is not much more than half complete; but
               the deficiency on the eastern side may be supplied by the vales of Wytheburn, Ulswater,
               Hawswater, and the Vale of Grasmere and Rydale; none of these however run up to the
               central point between Great Gavel and Scawfell. From this, hitherto our central point,
               take a flight of not more than three or four miles eastward to the ridge of Helvellyn
               and you will look down upon Wytheburn and St. John’s Vale, which are a branch of the
               Vale of Keswick, upon Ulswater stretching due east; and not far beyond to the south
               east, (though from this point not visible) lie the Vale and <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/3.jpg">[p. 3]</a> Lake of Hawswater; and lastly the winding Vale of Grasmere, Rydale, and Ambleside,
               brings you back to Winandermere, thus completing, though on the eastern side in an
               irregular manner, the representative figure of the wheel.</p>
            <p>Such, concisely given, is the general topographical view of the country of the Lakes
               in the North of England. But it must be observed that the visits of travellers are
               for the most part confined to the Vales of Coniston, Winandermere with the intermediate
               country between Ambleside and Keswick, the Vale of Keswick itself, Buttermere, and
               Ulswater, which are the most easy of access, and indeed from their several characters
               most likely to repay general curiosity; though each of the other more retired vales,
               as will appear when we enter into detail in the several numbers of this publication,
               has its own appropriate beauties—all exquisite in their kind.</p>
            <p>This Introduction will be confined as much as possible to general remarks. And first,
               returning to the illustrative figure which has been employed, it may be observed that
               from the circumference to the centre, that is from the sea or plain country, to the
               mountains of Great Gavel and Scawfell, there is in the several ridges that enclose
               these vales, and divide them from each other, I mean in the forms and surfaces, first
               of the swelling grounds, next of the hills and rocks, and lastly of the mountains,
               an ascent by almost regular gradation from elegance and richness to the highest point
               of grandeur. It follows therefore from this, first, that these rocks, hills, and mountains,
               must present themselves to the view in stages rising above each other, the mountains
               clustering together towards the central point; and, next, that an observer familiar
               with the several vales, must, from their various position in relation to the sun,
               have had before his eyes every possible embellishment of beauty, dignity, and splendour,
               which light and shadow can bestow upon objects so diversified. For example, in the
               Vale of Winandermere, if the spectator looks for gentle and lovely scenes, his eye
               is turned towards the south; if for the grand, towards the north; in the Vale of Keswick,
               which (as hath been said) lies almost due north of this, it is directly the reverse.
               Hence, when the sun is setting in summer far to the north west, it is seen by the
               spectator from the shores or breast of Winandermere resting among the summits of the
               loftiest mountains, some of which will perhaps be half or wholly hidden by clouds,
               or by the blaze of light which the orb diffuses around it; and the surface of the
               lake will reflect before the eye correspondent colours through every variety of beauty,
               and through all degrees of splendour. In the Vale of Keswick, at the same period,
               the sun sets over the humbler regions of the landscape, and showers down upon <em>them</em> the radiance which at once veils and glorifies, sending forth, meanwhile, broad streams
               of rosy, crimson, purple, or golden, light towards the grand mountains in the south
               and south east, which, thus illuminated, with all their projections and cavities,
               and with an intermixture of solemn shadows, are seen distinctly through <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/4_0.jpg">[p. 4]</a> a cool and clear atmosphere. Of course there is as marked a difference between the
               <em>noontide</em> appearance of these two opposite vales. The bedimming haze that overspreads the south,
               and the clear atmosphere and determined shadows of the clouds in the north, at the
               same time of the day, are each seen, in these several vales, with a contrast as striking.
               The reader perceiving in what degree the intermediate vales will partake of the same
               variety.</p>
            <p>I do not indeed know any tract of country in which, within so narrow a compass, may
               be found an equal variety in the influences of light and shadow upon the grand or
               gentle features of landscape; and it is owing to the combined circumstances to which
               I have directed the reader’s attention. From a point between the mountains of Great
               Gavel and Scawfell, a shepherd would not require more than an hour to descend into
               any one of eight of the principal vales by which he would be surrounded; and all the
               others lie (with the exception of Hawswater) but at a small distance. Yet, though
               thus clustered together, every valley has its distinct and separate character; in
               some instances as if they had been formed in studied contrast to each other, and in
               others with the united pleasing differences and resemblances of a sisterly rivalship.
               This concentration of interest gives to the country a decided superiority over the
               most attractive districts of Scotland and Wales, especially for the pedestrian traveller.
               In Scotland and Wales are found undoubtedly individual scenes which in their several
               kinds cannot be surpassed. But in Scotland particularly what desolate and unimpressive
               tracts of country almost perpetually intervene! so that the traveller, when he reaches
               a spot deservedly of great celebrity, is often at a loss to determine how much of
               his pleasure is owing to excellence inherent in the landscape itself, and how much
               to an instantaneous recovery from an oppression left upon his spirits by the barrenness
               and desolation through which he has passed.</p>
            <p>For the <em>forms</em> of these mountains I refer to the Etchings to which these pages are an Introduction,
               and from which it will appear that their outlines are endlessly diversified, sweeping
               easily or boldly in simple majesty, abrupt and precipitous, or soft and elegant. In
               magnitude and grandeur these mountains are individually inferior to the most celebrated
               of those in some other parts of this island; but in the combinations which they make,
               towering above each other, or lifting themselves in ridges like the waves of a tumultuous
               sea, and in the beauty and variety of their surfaces and their colours, they are surpassed
               by none.</p>
            <p>The general <em>surface</em> of the mountains is turf made rich and green by the moisture of the climate. Sometimes
               the turf, as in the neighbourhood of Newlands, in particular, is little broken, the
               whole covering being soft and downy pasturage. In other places rocks predominate;
               the soil is laid bare by torrents and burstings of water from the sides of the mountains
               in heavy rains; and occasionally their perpendicular sides are seamed by ravines formed
               also by rains and torrents, <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/5.jpg">[p. 5]</a> which, meeting in angular points, entrench and scar over the surface with numerous
               figures like the letters W and Y.</p>
            <p>The Mountains are composed of the stone by mineralogists termed schist, which, as
               you approach the plain country, gives way to lime-stone; but, schist being the substance
               of the mountains, the predominant <em>colour</em> of their <em>rocky</em> parts is bluish or of hoary grey—the general tint of the lichens with which the bare
               stone is encrusted. With this blue and grey colour is frequently intermixed a red
               tinge proceeding from the iron with which the stone is interveined and the soil in
               many places impregnated. The iron is the principle of decomposition in these rocks;
               and hence, when they become pulverized, the elementary particles crumbling down overspread
               in many places the steep and almost precipitous sides of the mountains with an intermixture
               of colours like the compound hues of a dove’s neck. When, in the heat of advancing
               summer, the freshness of the green tint of the herbage has somewhat faded, it is again
               revived by the appearance of the fern profusely spread every where; and upon this
               plant more than upon any thing else do the changes, which the seasons make in the
               colouring of the mountains depend. By the first week in October, the rich green which
               was preserved through the whole summer by the herbage and by this plant, has usually
               passed away; its brilliant and various colours of light yellow, orange, and brown,
               are then in harmony with the autumnal woods; bright yellow or lemon colour, at the
               base of the mountains, melting gradually through orange to a dark russet brown towards
               the summits, where the plant being more exposed to the weather, is in a more advanced
               state of decay. Neither heath nor furze are <em>generally</em> found upon the sides of these mountains, though in some places they are richly adorned
               by them. We may add, that the mountains are of height sufficient to have the surface
               towards the summits softened by distance, and to imbibe the finest aerial hues. In
               common also with other mountains, their apparent forms and colours are perpetually
               changed by the clouds and vapours which float round them; the effect indeed of mist
               and haze, in a country of this character, is like that of magic; I have seen six or
               seven ridges rising above each other, all created in a moment by the vapours upon
               the side of a mountain, which, in its ordinary appearance, shewed not a projecting
               point to furnish even a hint for such an operation.</p>
            <p>I will take this opportunity of observing that they, who have studied the appearances
               of nature, feel that the superiority, in point of visual interest, of mountainous
               over other countries—is more strikingly displayed in winter than in summer. This,
               as must be obvious is partly owing to the <em>forms</em>  of the mountains, which of course are not affected by the seasons; but also, in
               no small degree, to the greater variety which exists in their winter than their summer
               <em>colouring</em>. This variety is such and so harmoniously preserved, that it leaves little cause
               of <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/6_0.jpg">[p. 6]</a> regret when the splendour of autumn is passed away. The coppice woods, upon the sides
               of the mountains, retain russet leaves; the birch stands conspicuous with its silver
               stem and puce-coloured twigs; the hollies have come forth to view, with green leaves
               and scarlet berries, from among the deciduous trees whose summer foliage had concealed
               them; the ivy is now apparent upon the stems and boughs of the trees, and among the
               woody rocks. In place of the uniform summer green of the herbage and fern, many rich
               colours play into each other over the surface of the mountains; turf (whose tints
               are interchangeably tawny–green, olive, and brown), beds of withered fern, and grey
               rocks, being harmoniously blended together. The mosses and lichens are never so fresh
               and flourishing as in winter, if it be not a season of frost; and their minute beauties
               prodigally adorn the fore-ground. Wherever we turn, we find these productions of nature,
               to which winter is rather favourable than unkindly, scattered over the walls, banks
               of earth, rocks, and stones, and upon the trunks of trees, with the intermixture of
               several species of small fern, now green and fresh; and to the observing passenger
               their forms and colours are a source of inexhaustible admiration. Add to this the
               hoar frost and snow with all the varieties which they create, and which volumes would
               not be sufficient to describe. I will content myself with one instance of the colouring
               produced by snow, which may not be uninteresting to Painters. It is extracted from
               the memorandum book of a friend, and for its accuracy I can speak, as I myself was
               an eye-witness of the appearance. “I observed, says he, “the beautiful effect of the
               drifted snow upon the mountains, and the perfect <em>tone</em> of colour. From the top of the mountains downward a rich olive was produced by the
               powdery snow and the grass, which olive was warmed with a little brown, and in this
               way harmoniously combined, by insensible gradations, with the white. The drifting
               took away all the monotony of snow; and the whole vale of Grasmere, seen from the
               terrace walk in Easedale, was as varied, perhaps more so, than even in the pomp of
               autumn. In the distance was Loughrigg Fell, the basin wall of the lake; this, from
               the summit downward, was a rich orange-olive; then the lake a bright olive-green,
               nearly the same tint as the snow-powdered mountain tops and high slopes in Easedale;
               and lastly the church with its firs, forming the centre of the view. The firs looked
               magnificent, and carried the eye back to some firs in Brother’s Wood on the left side
               of the lake (we looking towards Loughrigg). Next to the church with its firs came
               nine distinguishable hills, six of them with woody sides turned towards us, all of
               them oak-copses with their bright red leaves and snow-powdered twigs; these hills
               all distinguishable indeed from the summit downward, but none seen all the way down,
               so as to give the strongest sense of number with unity; and these hills so variously
               situated to each other and to the view in general, so variously powdered, some only
               enough to give the herbage a rich brown tint, one intensely white and <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/7_0.jpg">[p. 7]</a> lighting up all the others, and yet so placed as in the most inobtrusive manner to
               harmonize by contrast with a perfect naked, snowless bleak summit in the far distance
               in the left—the variety of site, of colour, of woodiness, of the situation of the
               woods, &amp;c. &amp;c. made it not merely number with unity, but intricacy combined that activity
               of feeling, which intricacy awakens, with the complacency and repose of perfect unity.”</p>
            <p>Having spoken of the forms, surface, and colour of the mountains, let us descend into
               the <span class="smallcaps">Vallies</span>. Though these have been represented under the general image of the spokes of a wheel,
               they are for the most part winding; the windings of many being abrupt and intricate.
               And it may be observed that in one circumstance, the general shape of them all has
               been determined by that primitive conformation through which so many became receptacles
               of lakes. For they are not formed, as are most of the celebrated Welch Vallies, by
               an approximation of the sloping bases of the opposite mountains towards each other,
               leaving little more between than a channel for the passage of a hasty river; but the
               bottom of these vallies is, for the most part, a spacious and gently declining area
               apparently level as the floor of a temple, or the surface of a lake, and beautifully
               broken in many cases by rocks and hills which rise up like islands from the plain.
               As the vallies make many windings, these level areas open upon the traveller in succession,
               divided from each other sometimes by a mutual approximation of the hills leaving only
               a passage for a river; sometimes by correspondent windings without such approximation;
               and sometimes by a bold advance of one mountain towards that which is opposite to
               it. It may here be observed, with propriety, that the several rocks and hills, which
               I have described as rising up like islands from the level area of the vale, have regulated
               the choice of the inhabitants in the situation of their dwellings. Where none of these
               are found and the inclination of the ground is not sufficiently rapid easily to carry
               off the waters (as in the higher part of Langdale for instance), the houses are not
               sprinkled over the middle part of the vales but confined to their sides, being placed
               merely so far up the mountain as to protect them from the floods. But, where these
               rocks and hills have been scattered over the plain of the vale (as in Grasmere, Seathwaite,
               Eskdale, &amp;c.) the beauty which they give to the scene is much heightened by a single
               cottage or clustre of cottages which will be almost always found under them or upon
               their sides; dryness and shelter having tempted the Dalesmen to fix their habitations
               there.</p>
            <p>I shall now say a few words concerning the <span class="smallcaps">Lakes</span> of this country. The form of the lake is most perfect when, like Derwent-water and
               some of the smaller lakes, it least resembles that of a river. I mean, when being
               looked at from any given point where the whole may be seen at once, the width of it
               bears such proportion to the length that, however the outline may be diversified by
               far-shooting bays, it never assumes the shape of a river, and is contemplated with
               that placid and quiet feel- <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/8_0.jpg">[p. 8]</a> ing which belongs peculiarly to the lake as a body of still water under the influence
               of no current, reflecting therefore the clouds, the light, and all the imagery of
               the sky and surrounding hills, expressing and making visible the changes of the atmosphere,
               and motion of the lightest breeze, and subject to agitation only from the winds— </p>

            </blockquote>
            <p>It must be noticed as a favourable characteristic of the lakes of this country that
               though several of the largest, such as Winandermere, Ulswater, Hawswater, &amp;c. do,
               when the whole length of them is commanded from an elevated point, lose somewhat of
               the peculiar form of the lake and assume the resemblance of a magnificent river; yet,
               as their shape is winding (particularly that of Ulswater and Hawswater), when the
               view of the whole is obstructed by those barriers which determine the windings, and
               the spectator is confined to one reach, the appropriate feeling is revived; and one
               lake may thus in succession present the essential characteristic of many. Hence I
               am led to remark that, while the forms of the large lakes have this advantage, it
               is a circumstance still more favourable to the beauty of the country that the largest
               of them are small; and that the same valley generally furnishes a succession of lakes,
               instead of being filled by one. The vallies in North Wales, as hath been observed,
               are not formed for the reception of lakes; those of Switzerland, Scotland, and this
               part of the North England, are so formed; but in Switzerland and Scotland the proportion
               of diffused water is often too great, as at the lake of Geneva for instance, and most
               of the Scotch lakes. No doubt it sounds magnificent and flatters the imagination to
               hear at a distance of such expanses of water so many leagues in length and miles in
               width; and such ample room may be delightful to the fresh water sailor scudding with
               a lively breeze amid the rapidly shifting scenery. But who ever travelled along the
               banks of Loch Lomond variegated as the lower part is with islands, without wishing
               for a speedier termination of the long vista of blank water, for an interposition
               of green meadows, trees, and cottages, and a sparkling stream to run by his side?
               in fact, a notion of grandeur, as connected with magnitude, has seduced persons of
               taste into a general mistake upon this subject. It is much more desirable for the
               purposes of pleasure that lakes should be numerous, and small or middle sized than
               large, not only for communication by walks and rides, but for variety and recurrence
               of similar appearances. To illustrate this only by one instance:—how pleasing is it
               to have a ready and frequent opportunity of watching at the outlet of a lake, the
               stream pushing its way among the rocks in lively contrast with the stillness from
               which it has escaped; and how amusing to compare its noisy and turbulent motions with
               the <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/9_0.jpg">[p. 9]</a> gentle playfulness of the breezes, which may be starting up or wandering here and
               there over the faintly rippled surface of the broad water. I may add, as a general
               remark upon this subject, that in lakes of great width, the shores cannot be distinctly
               seen at the same time, and therefore contribute little to mutual illustration and
               ornament; and if, like the American and Asiatic lakes, the opposite shores are out
               of sight of each other, then unfortunately the traveller is reminded of a nobler object;
               he has the blankness of a sea prospect without the same grandeur and accompanying
               sense of power.</p>
            <p>So much for the form and size of lakes in general as illustrative of these in particular.—Their
               size and forms being thus in general terms described, I may add that, from the multitude
               of brooks and torrents which fall into them, and of internal springs by which they
               are fed, and which circulate through them like veins, they are truly living lakes, “<em>vivi lacus,</em>” and are thus discriminated from the stagnant and sullen pools frequent among mountains
               that have been formed by volcanos, and from the shallow meres which are found in flat
               and fenny countries. The water is also pure and chrystalline; so that, if it were
               not for the reflections of the incumbent mountains by which it is darkened, a delusion
               might be felt by a person resting quietly in a boat on the bosom of Winandermere or
               Derwent-water similar to that which Carver so beautifully describes when he was floating
               alone in the middle of the lake Erie or Ontario, and could almost have imagined that
               his boat was suspended in an element as pure as air, or rather that the air and water
               were one.</p>
            <p>As to the shores, it will be understood that those of the lakes in this country are
               endlessly diversified; in some places mountains, that admit of no cultivation, descend
               abruptly into the water; in others the shore is formed by gently sloping lawns and
               rich woods, with the interposition of flat and fertile meadows between the margin
               of the lake and the mountains; in many places they are beautifully edged with a rim
               of blue gravel; here and there are found, bordering the lake, groves (if I may so
               call them) of reeds and bulrushes, or water-lilies lifting up the orb of their large
               leaves to the breeze, if it be stirring, while the white flower is heaving upon the
               wave.</p>
            <p>The <span class="smallcaps">Islands</span> are neither so numerous, nor so beautiful, as might be expected from the account
               which I have given of the manner in which the level areas of the vales are so frequently
               diversified by rocks, hills, and hillocks, scattered over them; nor are they ornamented,
               as are sometimes the islands of the lakes in Scotland, by the remains of castles or
               other places of defence, or of monastic edifices. There is however a beautiful cluster
               of islands at Winandermere; a pair of pleasingly contrasted at Rydale; nor must the
               solitary green Island of Grasmere be forgotten. In the bosom of each of the lakes
               of Ennerdale and Devock-water is a single rock which owing to its neighbourhood to
               the sea, is <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/10_0.jpg">[p. 10]</a> </p>

               those bodies of still water which are called TARNS. These are found in some of the
               vallies, and are very numerous upon the mountains. A Tarn <em>in a vale</em> implies, for the most part, that the bed of the vale is not happily formed; that
               the water of the brooks can neither wholly escape, nor diffuse itself over a large
               area. Accordingly, in such situations, tarns are often surrounded by a tract of boggy
               ground which has an unsightly appearance; but this is not always the case, and in
               the cultivated parts of the country, when the shores of the tarn are determined, it
               differs only from the lake in being smaller and in belonging mostly to a smaller valley
               or circular recess. Of this miniature class of lakes Loughrigg Tarn near Grasmere
               is the most beautiful example. It has its margin of green firm meadows, of rocks and
               rocky woods, a few reeds here, a little company of water lilies there, with beds of
               gravel or stone beyond; a tiny stream issuing neither briskly nor sluggishly out of
               it; but its feeding rills, from the shortness of their course, so small as to be scarcely
               visible. Five or six cottages are reflected in its peaceful bosom; rocky and barren
               steeps rise up above the hanging enclosures; and the solemn pikes of Langdale overlook,
               from a distance, the low cultivated ridge of land that forms the northern boundary
               of this small, quiet, and fertile domain. The <em>mountain</em> tarns can only be recommended to the notice of the inquisitive traveller who has
               time to spare. They are difficult of access and naked; yet some of them are, in their
               permanent forms, very grand; and there are accidents of things which would make the
               meanest of them interesting. In the first place one of these pools is an acceptable
               sight to the mountain wanderer, not merely as an incident that diversifies the prospect,
               but as forming in his mind a spot or conspicuous point to which objects, otherwise
               disconnected or unsubordinated, may be referred. Some few have a varied outline, with
               bold heath-clad promontories; and, as they mostly lie at the foot of a steep precipice,
               the water appears black and sullen; and round the margin, masses of rock are scattered.
               The feeling of solitude is seldom more strongly and more solemnly impressed than by
               the side of one of these mountain pools; though desolate and forbidding, it seems
               a distinct place to repair to, yet where the visitants must be rare, and there can
               be no disturbance—Water fowl flock hither; and the lonely angler may oftentimes here
               be seen; but the imagination, not content with this, is tempted to attribute a voluntary
               power to every change which takes place in such a spot, whether it be the breeze that
               wanders over the surface of the water, or the splendid lights of evening that rest
               upon it in the midst of the awful precipices. <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/11_0.jpg">[p. 11]</a> </p>

            <p>Though this country is, on one side, bounded by the sea which combines beautifully,
               from some elevated points of view, with the inland scenery; yet no where are found
               the grand estuaries which are common in Scotland and Wales: the lakes are such in
               the strict and usual sense of the word, being all of fresh water; nor have the rivers
               themselves, from the shortness of their course, time to acquire that body of water
               necessary to confer upon them much majesty. In fact, while they continue in the mountain
               and lake country, they are rather large brooks than rivers. The water is perfectly
               pellucid, through which in many places are seen to a great depth their beds of rock
               or of blue gravel, which give to the water itself and exquisitely cerulean colour:
               this is particularly striking in the rivers of Derwent and Duddon which may confidently
               be compared, such and so various are their beauties, to any two rivers of equal length
               of course in any country. The number of the torrents and smaller brooks is infinite,
               with their water-falls and water-breaks; and they need not here be described. I will
               only observe that, as many, even of the smallest of these rills, have either found
               or made for themselves recesses in the sides of the mountains or in the vales, they
               have tempted the primitive inhabitants to settle near them for household accommodation
               and for shelter; and hence the retirement and seclusion by which these cottages are
               endeared to the eye of the man of sensibility.</p>
            <p>The woods consist chiefly of oak, ash, and birch, and here and there (though very
               rarely) a species of elm, with underwood of hazel, the white and black thorn and hollies;
               in the moist places alders and willows abound; and yews among the rocks. Formerly
               the whole country must have been covered with wood to a great height up the mountains;
               and native Scotch firs (as in the northern parts of Scotland to this day) must have
               grown in great profusion. But no one of these old inhabitants of the country remains,
               or perhaps has done for some hundreds of years; beautiful traces, however, of the
               universal sylvan appearance, which the country formerly had, are yet seen both in
               the native coppice woods which remain, and which have been protected by enclosures,
               and also in the forest trees and hollies which, though disappearing fast, are yet
               scattered over both the enclosed and uninclosed parts of the mountains. The same is
               expressed by the beauty and intricacy with which the fields and coppice-woods are
               often intermingled: the plough of the first settlers having followed naturally the
               veins of richer, dryer, or less stony soil; and thus it has shaped out an intermixture
               of wood and lawn the grace <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/12_0.jpg">[p. 12]</a> and wildness of which it would have been impossible for the hand of studied art to
               produce. Other trees have been introduced within these last fifty years, such as beeches,
               larches, elms, limes, &amp;c. and plantations of Scotch firs, seldom with advantage, and
               often with great injury to the appearance of the country: but the sycamore (which
               I believe was brought into this island from Germany not more than two hundred years
               ago) has long been the favourite of the cottagers; and, with the Scotch fir, has been
               chosen to screen their dwellings; and is sometimes found in the fields whither the
               winds or waters may have carried its seeds.</p>
            <p>The want which is most felt, however, is that of timber trees. There are few magnificent
               ones to be found near any of the lakes; and indeed, unless greater care be taken,
               there will in a short time scarcely be left an oak that would repay the cost of felling.
               The neighbourhood of Rydale, notwithstanding the havoc which has been made, is yet
               nobly distinguished; and we have reason to hope, will long continue so. In the woods
               of Lowther also are found store of the grandest trees, and all the majesty and wildness
               of the native forest.</p>
            <p>Among the smaller vegetable ornaments which nature has here provided, must be reckoned
               the juniper, bilberry, and the broom plant, with which the hills and woods abound,
               the Dutch myrtle in moist places, and the endless variety of brilliant flowers in
               the fields and meadows; which, if the agriculture of the country were more carefully
               attended to, would disappear. Nor can I omit again to notice the lichens and mosses,
               which, in profusion, beauty, and variety, exceed those of any other country I have
               seen.</p>
            <p>Thus far I have chiefly spoken of the features by which Nature has discriminated this
               country from others. I will now describe in general terms, in what manner it is indebted
               to the hand of man. What I have to notice on this subject will emanate most easily
               and perspicuously from a description of the ancient and present inhabitants, their
               occupations, their condition of life, the distribution of landed property among them,
               and the tenure by which it is holden.</p>
            <p>The reader will here suffer me to recall to his mind the description which I have
               given of the substance and form of these mountains, the shape of the vallies and their
               position with respect to each other. He will people the vallies with lakes and rivers,
               the sides and coves of the mountains with pools and torrents; and will bound half
               of the circle which we have contemplated by the sands of the sea, or by the sea itself.
               He will conceive that, from the point upon which he before stood he looks down upon
               this scene before the country had been penetrated by any inhabitants; to vary his
               sensations and to break in upon their stillness, he will form to himself an image
               of the tides visiting and revisiting the Friths, the main sea dashing against the
               bolder shore, the rivers pursuing their course to be lost in the mighty mass of waters.
               He may see or hear in fancy the winds sweeping over the lakes, <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/13_0.jpg">[p. 13]</a> or piping with a loud noise among the mountain peaks; and lastly may think of the
               primœval woods shedding and renewing their leaves with no human eye to notice, or
               human heart to regret or welcome the change. “When the first settlers entered this
               region, (says an animated writer) they found it overspread with wood; forest trees,
               the fir, the oak, the ash, and the birch, had skirted the fells, tufted the hills,
               and shaded the vallies through centuries of silent solitude; the birds and beasts
               of prey reigned over the meeker species; and the bellum inter omnia maintained the
               balance of nature in the empire of beasts.”</p>
            <p>Such was the state and appearance of this region when the aboriginal colonists of
               the Celtic tribes were first driven or drawn towards it, and became joint tenants
               with the wolf, the boar, the wild bull, the red deer and the leigh, a gigantic species
               of deer which has been long extinct; while the inaccessible crags were occupied by
               the falcon, the raven, and the eagle. The inner parts were too secluded and of too
               little value to participate much of the benefit of Roman manners; and though these
               conquerors encouraged the Britons to the improvement of their lands in the plain country
               of Furness and Cumberland, they seem to have had little connection with the mountains
               which were not subservient to the profit they drew from the mines.</p>
            <p>When the Romans retired from Great Britain, it is well known that these mountain fastnesses
               furnished a protection to some unsubdued Britons, long after the more accessible and
               more fertile districts had been seized by the Saxon or Danish invader. A few traces
               of Roman forts or camps, as at Ambleside and upon Dunmallet, (erected probably to
               secure a quiet transfer of the ore from the mines) and two or three circles of rude
               stones attributed to the Druids, are the only visible vestiges, that remain upon the
               surface of the country, of these ancient occupants; and as the Saxons and Danes, who
               succeeded to the possession of the villages and hamlets which had been established
               by the Britons, seem to have confined themselves to the open country,—we may descend
               at once to times long posterior to the conquest by the Normans when their feudal policy
               was regularly established. We may easily conceive that these narrow dales and mountain
               sides, choaked up as they would be with wood, lying out of the way of communication
               with other parts of the Island, and upon the edge of a hostile kingdom, would have
               little attraction for the high-born and powerful; especially as the more open parts
               of the country furnished positions for castles and houses of defence sufficient to
               repel any of those sudden attacks, which in the then rude state of military knowledge,
               could be made upon them. Accordingly the more retired regions (and observe it is to
               these I am now confining myself) must have been neglected or shunned even by the persons
               whose baronial or seignioral rights extended over them, and left doubtless partly
               as a place of refuge for outlaws and robbers, and partly granted out for the more
               settled habi- <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/14_0.jpg">[p. 14]</a> tation of a few vassals following the employment of shepherds or woodlanders. Hence
               these lakes and inner vallies are unadorned by any of the remains of ancient grandeur,
               castles or monastic edifices, which are only found upon the skirts of this country,
               as Furness Abbey, Calder Abbey, the Priory of Lanercost, Gleaston Castle, the original
               residence of the Flemings, and the numerous ancient Castles of the Cliffords and the
               Dacres. On the southern side of these mountains, (especially in that part known by
               the name of Furness Fells, which is more remote from the borders) the state of society
               would necessarily be more settled; though it was fashioned not a little, with the
               rest of this country, by its neighbourhood to a hostile kingdom. We will therefore
               give a sketch of the œconomy of the Abbots in the distribution of lands among their
               tenants, as similar plans were doubtless adopted by other Lords, and as the consequences
               have affected the face of the country materially to the present day, being in fact
               one of the principal causes which give it such a striking superiority, in beauty and
               interest over all other parts of the Island.</p>
            <p>“When the Abbots of Furness,” says an author before cited, “enfranchised their villains,
               and raised them to the dignity of customary tenants, the lands, which they had cultivated
               for their lord were divided into whole tenements; each of which, besides the customary
               annual rent, was charged with the obligation of having in readiness a man completely
               armed for the king’s service on the borders or elsewhere; each of these whole tenements
               was again subdivided into four equal parts; each villain had one; and the party tenant
               contributed his share to the support of the man at arms, and of other burthens. These
               divisions were not properly distinguished; the land remained mixed; each tenant had
               a share through all the arable and meadow land, and common of pasture over all the
               wastes. These sub-tenements were judged sufficient for the support of so many families;
               and no further division was permitted. These divisions and sub-divisions were convenient
               at the time for which they were calculated; the land, so parcelled out, was of necessity
               more attended to; and the industry greater, when more persons were to be supported
               by the produce of it. The frontier of the kingdom, within which Furness was considered,
               was in a constant state of attack and defence; more hands therefore were necessary
               to guard the coast, to repel an invasion from Scotland, or make reprisals on the hostile
               neighbour. The dividing the lands in such manner as has been shewn, increased the
               number of inhabitants, and kept them at home till called for; and, the land being
               mixed, and the several tenants united in equipping the plough, the absence of the
               fourth man was no prejudice to the cultivation of his land, which was committed to
               the care of three.</p>
            <p>While the villains of Low Furness were thus distributed over the land, and employed
               in agriculture; those of High Furness were charged with the care of flocks and herds,
               to protect them from the wolves which lurked in the thickets, <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/15_0.jpg">[p. 15]</a> and in winter to brouze them with the tender sprouts of hollies and ash. This custom
               was not till lately discontinued in High Furness; and holly trees were carefully preserved
               for that purpose, when all other wood was cleared off; large tracts of common being
               so covered with these trees as to have the appearance of a forest of hollies. At the
               Shepherd’s call the flocks surrounded the holly bush, and received the croppings at
               his hand which they greedily nibbled up, bleating for more. The Abbots of Furness
               enfranchised these pastoral vassals, and permitted them to enclose <span style="font-style:italic">quillets </span>to their houses for which they paid encroachment rent.”—<span class="smallcaps">West’s</span> <em>Antiquities of Furness</em>.</p>
            <p>However desirable for the purposes of defence a numerous population might be, it was
               not possible to make at once the same numerous allotments among the untilled vallies
               and upon the sides of the mountains as had been made in the cultivated plains. The
               enfranchised shepherd or woodlander, having chosen there his place of residence, builds
               it of sods or of the mountain stone, and with the permission of his lord, encloses,
               like Robinson Crusoe, a small croft or two immediately at his door for such animals
               chiefly as he wishes to protect. Others are happy to imitate his example, and avail
               themselves of the same privileges; and thus population creeps on towards the more
               secluded parts of the vallies. Chapels, daughters of some distant mother church, are
               first erected in the more open and fertile vales, as those of Bowness and Grasmere,
               offsets of Kendal; which again after a period, as the settled population increases,
               become mother churches to smaller edifices scattered at length almost in every dale
               throughout the country. The enclosures, formed by the tenantry, are for a long time
               confined to the home-steads; and the arable and meadow land of the vales is possessed
               in common field; the several portions being marked out by stones, bushes, or trees;
               which portions, where the custom has survived, to this day are called <em>Dales</em>, probably from the Belgic word <em>deylen</em>, (to distribute) but while the vale was thus lying open, enclosures seem to have
               taken place, upon the sides of the mountains; because the land there was not intermixed,
               and was of little comparative value; and therefore small opposition would be made
               to its being appropriated by those to whose habitations it was contiguous. Hence the
               singular appearance which the sides of many of these mountains exhibit, intersected
               as they are almost to their summit, with stone walls, of which the fences are always
               formed. When first erected, they must have little disfigured the face of the country;
               as part of the lines would every where be hidden by the quantity of native wood then
               remaining; and the lines would also be broken (as they still are) by the rocks which
               interrupt and vary their course. In the meadows, and in those parts of the lower grounds
               where the soil has not been sufficiently drained and could not afford a stable foundation,
               there, when the encreasing value of land and the inconvenience suffered from intermixed
               plots of ground in common field had induced each in- <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/16_0.jpg">[p. 16]</a> habitant to enclose his own, they were compelled to make the fences of alders, willows,
               and other trees. These where the native wood had disappeared, have frequently enriched
               the vallies with a sylvan appearance; while the intricate intermixture of property
               has given to the fences a graceful irregularity, which, where large properties are
               prevalent and large capitals employed in agriculture, is unknown. This sylvan appearance
               is still further heightened by the number of ash trees which have been planted in
               rows along the quick fences, and along the walls, for the purpose of brouzing cattle
               at the approach of winter. The branches are lopped off and strewed upon the pastures;
               and, when the cattle have stripped them of the leaves, they are used for repairing
               hedges or for fuel.</p>
            <p>We have thus seen a numerous body of dalesmen creeping into possession of their home-steads,
               their little crofts, their mountain enclosures; and finally, the whole vale is visibly
               divided; except perhaps here and there some marshy ground, which till fully drained,
               would not repay the trouble of enclosing. But these last partitions do not seem to
               have been general till long after the pacification of the Borders, by the union of
               the two crowns; when the cause, which had first determined the distribution of land
               into such small parcels, had not only ceased,—but likewise a general improvement had
               taken place in the country, with a correspondent rise in the value of its produce.
               From the time of the union of the two kingdoms, it is certain that this species of
               feudal population would rapidly diminish. That it was formerly much more numerous
               than it is at present, is evident from the multitude of tenements (I do not mean houses,
               but small divisions of land) which belonged formerly each to its several proprietor,
               and for which separate fines are paid to the manorial lord at this day. These are
               often in the proportion of four to one, of the present occupants. “Sir Launcelot Threlkeld
               who lived in the reign of Henry VII, was wont to say, he had three noble houses, one
               for pleasure, Crosby in Westmoreland, where he had a park full of deer; one for profit
               and warmth, wherein to reside in winter, namely, Yanwith nigh Penrith; and the third,
               Threlkeld (on the edge of the vale of Keswick) well stocked with tenants to go with
               him to the wars.” But, as I have said, from the union of the two kingdoms this numerous
               vassalage (their services not being wanted) would rapidly diminish; various tenements
               would be united in one possessor; and the aboriginal houses, probably little better
               than hovels, like the kraels of savages or the huts of the Highlanders of Scotland,
               would many of them fall into decay and wholly disappear, while the place of others
               was supplied by substantial and comfortable buildings, a majority of which remain
               to this day scattered over the vallies, and are in many the only dwellings found in
               them.</p>
            <p>From the time of the erection of these houses, till within the last forty years, the
               state of society, though no doubt slowly and gradually improving, underwent <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/17_0.jpg">[p. 17]</a> no material change. Corn was grown in these vales (through which no carriage road
               had been made) sufficient upon each estate to furnish bread for each family, and no
               more: notwithstanding the union of several tenements, the possessions of each inhabitant
               still being small, in the same field was seen an intermixture of different crops;
               and the plough was interrupted by little rocks, mostly overgrown with wood, or by
               spungy places which the Tillers of the soil had neither leisure nor capital to convert
               into firm land. The storms and moisture of the climate induced them to sprinkle their
               upland property with outhouses of native stone as places of shelter for their sheep,
               where in tempestuous weather food was distributed to them. Every family spun from
               its own flock the wool with which it was clothed; a weaver was here and there found
               among them; and the rest of their wants were supplied by the produce of the yarn,
               which they carded and spun in their own houses upon the large wheel, and carried it
               to market either under their arms, or more frequently on pack-horses, a small train
               taking their way weekly down the valley or over the mountains to the most commodious
               town. They had, as I have said, their rural chapel, and of course their Minister,
               in cloathing or in manner of life in no respect differing from themselves, except
               on the Sabbath-day; this was the sole distinguished individual among them; every thing
               else, person and possession, exhibited a perfect equality, a community of Shepherds,
               and Agriculturalists, proprietors for the most part of the lands which they occupied
               and cultivated.</p>
            <p>While the process above detailed was going on, the native Forests must have been every
               where receding: but trees were planted for the sustenance of the flocks in winter,
               such was the then rude state of agriculture; and, for the same cause, it was necessary
               that care should be taken of some part of the growth of the native forest. Accordingly
               in Queen Elizabeth’s time this was so strongly felt, that a petition was made to the
               Crown praying “that the Blomaries in high Furness might be abolished on account of
               the quantity of wood which was consumed in them for the use of the Mines, to the great
               detriment of the cattle.” But this same cause, about a hundred years after, produced
               effects directly contrary to those which had been deprecated. The re-establishment,
               at that period, of furnaces upon a large scale made it the interest of the people
               to convert the steepest and more stony of the enclosures, sprinkled over with the
               remains of the native forest, into close woods, which, when cattle and sheep were
               excluded, rapidly sowed and thickened themselves. I have already directed the Readers
               attention to the cause by which tufts of wood, pasturage, meadow and arable land with
               its various produce are intricately intermingled in the same field; and he will now
               see in like manner how enclosures entirely of wood, and those of cultivated ground,
               are blended all over the country under a law of similar wildness. <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/18_0.jpg">[p. 18]</a></p>
            <p>An historic detail has thus been given of the manner in which the hand of man has
               acted upon the surface of the inner regions of the mountainous country, as incorporated
               with and subservient to the powers and processes of nature. We will now take a view
               of the same agency acting within narrower bounds for the production of the few works
               of art and accommodations of life which in so simple a state of society, could be
               necessary. These are merely habitations of man and coverts for beasts, roads and bridges,
               and places of worship.</p>
            <p>And to begin with the <span class="smallcaps">Cottages</span>. They are scattered over the vallies, and under the hill sides, and on the rocks;
               and to this day in the more retired dales, without any intrusion of more assuming
               buildings, </p>

            <p> The dwelling houses, and contiguous out-houses are in many instances of the colour
               of the native rock out of which they have been built; but frequently the dwelling
               house has been distinguished from the barn and byre by rough-cast, and white wash,
               which, as the inhabitants are not hasty in renewing it, in a few years acquires, by
               the influence of the weather, a tint at once sober and variegated. As these houses
               have been from father to son inhabited by persons engaged in the same occupations,
               yet necessarily with changes in their circumstances, they have received additions
               and accommodations adapted to the needs of each successive occupant, who, being for
               the most part proprietor, was at liberty to follow his own fancy; so that these humble
               dwellings remind the contemplative spectator of a production of nature, and may (using
               a strong expression) rather be said to have grown than to have been erected;—to have
               risen by an instinct of their own out of the native rock; so little is there in them
               of formality; such is their wildness and beauty. Among the numerous recesses and projections
               in the walls and in the different stages of their roofs are seen the boldest and most
               harmonious effects of contrasted sunshine and shadow. It is a favourable circumstance
               that the strong winds which sweep down the vallies induced the inhabitants, at a time
               when the materials for building were easily procured, to furnish many of these dwellings
               with substantial porches; and such as have not this defence are seldom unprovided
               with a projection of two large slates over their threshholds. Nor will the singular
               beauty of the chimnies escape the eye of the attentive traveller. Sometimes a low
               chimney, almost upon a level with the roof, is overlaid with a slate, supported upon
               four slender pillars, to prevent the wind from driving the smoke down the chimney.
               Others are of a quadrangular shape rising one or two feet above the roof; which low
               square is surmounted by a tall cylinder giving to the cottage chimney the most <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/19_0.jpg">[p. 19]</a> beautiful shape in which it is ever seen. Nor will it be too fanciful or refined
               to remark, as a general principle, that there is a pleasing harmony between a tall
               chimney of this circular form and the living column of smoke through the still air
               ascending from it. These dwellings, as has been said, are built of rough unhewn stone;
               and they are roofed with slates which were rudely taken from the quarry, before the
               present art of splitting them was understood, and the slates are therefore rough and
               uneven in their surfaces. Both the coverings and sides of the houses have furnished
               places of rest for the seeds of lichens, mosses, fern, and flowers. Hence buildings,
               which in their very form call to mind the processes of nature, do thus, by this vegetable
               garb with which they are cloathed, appear to be received into the bosom of the living
               principle of things, as it acts and exists among the woods and fields; and, by their
               colour and their shape, affectingly direct the thoughts to that tranquil course of
               nature and simplicity along which the humble-minded inhabitants have through so many
               generations been led. Add the little garden with its shed for bee-hives, its small
               beds of pot-herbs, and its border and patches of flowers for Sunday posies, with sometimes
               a choice few too much prized to be plucked; an orchard of proportioned size; a cheese-press
               often supported by some tree near the door; a cluster of embowering sycamores for
               summer shade, with a tall Scotch fir through which the winds sing when other trees
               are leafless; the little rill or household spout murmuring in all seasons—combine
               these incidents and images together, and you have the representative idea of a mountain
               cottage in this country, so beautifully formed in itself and so richly adorned by
               the hand of nature.</p>
            <p>Till within the last forty years there was no communication between any of these vales
               by carriage roads; all bulky articles were transported on pack-horses. But, owing
               to the population not being concentrated in villages but scattered, the vallies themselves
               were intersected as now by innumerable lanes and pathways leading from house to house
               and from field to field. These lanes where they are fenced by stone walls are mostly
               bordered with ashes, hazels, wild roses, and beds of tall fern, at their base; while
               the walls themselves if old, are overspread with mosses, small ferns, wild strawberries,
               the geranium, and lichens; and, if the wall happens to rest against a bank of earth,
               it is sometimes almost wholly concealed by a rich facing of stone-fern. It is a great
               advantage to a traveller or resident, that these numerous lanes and paths, if he be
               a zealous admirer of nature, will introduce him, nay, will lead him on into all the
               recesses of the country, so that the hidden treasures of its landscapes will by an
               ever ready guide be laid open to his eyes.</p>
            <p>Likewise to the smallness of the several properties is owing the great number of bridges
               over the brooks and torrents, and the daring and graceful neglect of danger or accommodation
               with which so many of them are constructed, the rude- <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/20_0.jpg">[p. 20]</a> ness of the forms of some, and their endless variety. But, when I speak of this rudeness,
               I must at the same time add that many of these structures are in themselves models
               of elegance, as if they had been formed upon principles of the most thoughtful architecture.
               It is to be regretted that these monuments of the skill of our ancestors, and of that
               happiness of instinct by which consummate beauty was produced, are disappearing fast;
               but sufficient specimens remain to give a high gratification to the man of genuine
               taste. Such travellers as may not be accustomed to pay attention to these things will
               excuse me if I point out the proportion between the span and elevation of the arch,
               the lightness of the parapet, and the graceful manner in which its curve follows faithfully
               that of the arch.</p>
            <p>Upon this subject I have nothing further to notice, except the places of worship,
               which have mostly a little school-house adjoining. The lowliness of simple elegance
               of these churches and chapels, a well proportioned oblong with a porch, in some instances
               a steeple tower, and in others nothing more than a small belfry in which one or two
               bells hang visibly,—these are objects which, though pleasing in their forms, must
               necessarily, more than any others in rural scenery, derive their interest from the
               feelings of piety and reverence for the modest virtues and simple manners of humble
               life with which they may be contemplated. A man must be very insensible who would
               not be touched with pleasure at the sight of the Chapel of Buttermere, which by its
               diminutive size, so strikingly expresses how small must be the congregation there
               assembled, as it were like one family, and proclaims at the same time to the passenger,
               in connection with the surrounding mountains, the depth of that seclusion in which
               the people live which has rendered necessary the building of a separate place of worship
               for so few. A Patriot, calling to mind the image of the stately fabrics of Canterbury,
               York, or Westminster, will find a heartfelt satisfaction in presence of this lowly
               pile, as a monument of the wise institutions of our country, and as evidence of the
               all-pervading and paternal care of that venerable Establishment of which it is perhaps
               the humblest daughter.—The edifice is scarcely larger than many of the single stones
               or fragments of rock which are scattered near it.</p>
            <p>We have thus far confined our observations on this division of the subject to that
               part of these Dales which runs far up into the mountains. In addition to such objects
               as have been hitherto described, it may be mentioned that, as we descend towards the
               open part of the Vales, we meet with the remains of ancient Parks, and with old mansions
               of more stately architecture; and it may be observed that to these circumstances the
               country owes whatever ornament it retains of majestic and full-grown timber, as the
               remains of the park of the ancient family of the Ratcliffs at Derwent-water, Gowbray-park,
               and the venerable woods of Rydale. Through the more open part of the vales also are
               scattered houses of <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/21_0.jpg">[p. 21]</a> a middle rank between the pastoral cottage and the old hall-residences of the more
               wealthy <em>estatesman</em> with more spacious domains attached to them.</p>
            <p>Thus has been given a faithful description, the minuteness of which the Reader will
               pardon, of the face of this country as it was and had been through centuries till
               within the last forty years. Towards the head of these Dales was found a perfect Republic
               of Shepherds and Agriculturists, among whom the plough of each man was confined to
               the maintenance of his own family, or to the occasional accommodation of his neighbour.
               Two or three cows furnished each family with milk and cheese. The Chapel was the only
               edifice that presided over these dwellings, the supreme head of this pure Commonwealth;
               the members of which existed in the midst of a powerful empire, like an ideal society
               or an organized community whose constitution had been imposed and regulated by the
               mountains which protected it. Neither Knight nor Squire nor high-born Nobleman was
               here; but many of these humble sons of the hills had a consciousness that the land,
               which they walked over and tilled, had for more than five hundred years been possessed
               by men of their name and blood—and venerable was the transition when a curious traveller,
               descending from the heart of the mountains, had come to some ancient manorial residence
               in the more open part of the vales, which, with the rights attached to its proprietor,
               connected the almost visionary mountain Republic which he had been contemplating with
               the substantial frame of society as existing in the laws and constitution of a mighty
               empire.</p>
            <p>Such, as I have said, was the appearance of things till within these last forty years.
               A practice which by a strange abuse of terms has been denominated ornamental gardening,
               was at that time, becoming generally prevalent over England. In union with an admiration
               of this art, and in some instances in opposition to it, had been generated a relish
               for select parts of natural scenery; and Travellers, instead of confining their observations
               to Towns, Manufactures, or Mines, began (a thing till then unheard of) to wander over
               the Island in search of sequestered spots which they might have accidentally learnt
               were distinguished for the sublimity and beauty of the forms of nature there to be
               seen. Dr. Brown the celebrated author of the “Estimate of the Manners and Principles
               of the Times,” &amp;c. published a letter to a friend in which the attractions of the
               Vale of Keswick were delineated with a powerful pencil and the feeling of a genuine
               enthusiast. Gray, the Poet followed; and the report, which he gave, was circulated
               among his friends. He died soon after his forlorn and melancholy pilgrimage to the
               Vale of Keswick; and the record which he left behind him of what he had seen and felt
               in this journey excited that pensive interest with which the human mind is ever disposed
               to listen to the farewell words of a man of genius. The journal of Gray feelingly
               recorded the manner in which the gloom of ill health and low spirits had been irradiated
               by objects most beautiful and sublime which the Author’s <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/22_0.jpg">[p. 22]</a> powers of mind enabled him to describe with distinctness and unaffected simplicity.
               The Vale of Grasmere is thus happily discriminated at the close of his description.—“Not
               a single red tile, no gentleman’s flaring house or garden walls, break in upon the
               repose of this little unsuspected paradise; but all is peace, rusticity, and happy
               poverty, in its neatest and most becoming attire.”</p>
            <p>What is here so justly said of Grasmere applied almost equally to all its sister vales.
               It was well for the undisturbed pleasure of the Poet’s mind that he had no forebodings
               of what was so soon after to take place; and it might have been hoped that these words,
               at once the dictate of a sympathetic heart, a pure imagination, and a genuine taste,
               would almost of themselves have preserved the ancient franchises of this and other
               kindred mountain retirements from trespass or intrusion, or (shall I dare to say?)
               would have secured scenes so consecrated from profanation. The Lakes had now become
               celebrated; the mania of ornamental gardening and prospect hunting had spread wide;
               visitors flocked hither from all parts of the Island; the fancies of some of these
               were so strongly smitten that they became settlers; and numerous violations soon ensued.</p>
            <p>This beautiful country has, in a great variety of instances, suffered from the spirit
               of tasteless and capricious innovation. No one can now travel through the more frequented
               tracts, without finding at almost every turn the venerable and pure simplicity of
               nature vitiated by some act of inconsiderate and impertinent art; without being offended
               by an introduction of discordant objects, disturbing every where that peaceful harmony
               of form and colour which had been through a long lapse of ages most happily preserved.</p>
            <p>All gross transgressions of this kind in matters of taste originate in a feeling natural
               and honourable to the human mind, viz., the pleasure which we receive from distinct
               ideas and from the perception of order, regularity, and contrivance. Now unpractised
               minds receive these impressions only from objects between which there exists eternally
               a strong demarkation; hence the pleasure with which such minds are smitten by formality
               and harsh contrast. But I would beg of those who, under the control of this craving
               for distinct ideas, are hastily setting about the production of food by which it may
               be gratified, to temper their impatience, to look carefully about them, to observe
               and to watch; and they will find gradually growing within them a sense by which they
               will be enabled to perceive in a country so lavishly gifted by nature an ever-renewing
               variety of forms which will be marked out with a precision that will satisfy their
               desires. Moreover, a new habit of pleasure will be forming in the mind the opposite
               of this, viz., a habit arising out of the perception of the fine gradations by which
               in nature one thing passes away into another, and the boundaries that constitute individuality
               disappear in one instance only to be renewed in another under a more alluring form.
               My meaning will at once be obvious to those who remember the hill of Dunmallet at
               the foot of <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/23_0.jpg">[p. 23]</a> Ulswater divided into different portions, as it once was by avenues of fir trees
               with a green and almost perpendicular lane descending down the steep hill through
               each avenue; who can recall to mind the delight with which they might as children
               have looked at this quaint appearance; and are enabled to contrast that remembrance
               with the pleasure which the more practiced eye of mature age would create for itself
               from the image of the same hill overgrown with self-planted wood, each tree springing
               up in the situation best suited to its kind, and with that shape which the same situation
               constrained or suffered it to take. What endless melting and playing into each other
               of forms and colours does the one offer to a mind at once attentive and active; and
               how insipid and lifeless, compared with it, appear those parts of its former exhibition
               with which a child, a peasant perhaps, or a citizen unfamiliar with natural imagery,
               would have been most delighted! I cannot however omit observing that the disfigurement,
               which this country has undergone has not proceeded wholly from those common feelings
               of human nature which have been referred to as the primary sources of bad taste in
               rural scenery; another cause must be added, which has chiefly shewn itself in its
               effect upon buildings. I mean a constraint or warping of the natural mind arising
               out of a sense that, this country being an object of general admiration, every new
               house would be looked at and commented upon either for approbation or censure. Hence
               all the deformity and ungracefulness which ever pursue the steps of constraint or
               affectation. Men, who in Leicestershire or Northamptonshire would probably have built
               a modest dwelling like those of their sensible neighbours, have been turned out of
               their course; and acting a part, no wonder if, having had little experience, they
               act it ill. Moreover, the craving for prospect which is immoderate, particularly in
               new settlers, has rendered it impossible that buildings, whatever might have been
               their architecture, should in most instances be ornamental to the landscape; starting,
               as they do on the summits of naked hills in staring contrast to the snugness and privacy
               of the ancient houses.</p>
            <p>I do not condemn in any man a desire that his residence and possessions should draw
               upon them the approbation of the judicious; nor do I censure attempts to decorate
               them for that purpose. I rather applaud both the one and the other; and would shew
               in what manner the end may be best attained. The rule is simple; with respect to grounds,—work,
               where you can, in the spirit of nature with an invisible hand of art. Planting, and
               a removal of wood, may thus and thus only be carried on with good effect; and the
               like may be said of building, if antiquity which may be stiled the copartner and sister
               of nature, be not denied the respect to which she is entitled. I have already spoken
               of the beautiful forms of the ancient mansions of this country, and of the happy manner
               in which they harmonize with the forms of nature. Why cannot these be taken as a model
               and modern internal convenience be confined within their external grace and dignity?
               But, <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/24_0.jpg">[p. 24]</a> should expense to be avoided or difficulties to be overcome prevent a close adherence
               to this model, still it might be followed to a certain degree in the style of architecture
               and in the choice of situation, if the craving for prospect were mitigated by those
               considerations of comfort, shelter, and convenience, which used to be chiefly sought
               after. But should an aversion to old fashions unfortunately exist accompanied with
               a desire to transplant into the cold and stormy North, the elegancies of a villa formed
               upon a model taken from countries with a milder climate, I will adduce a passage from
               an English Poet, the divine Spenser, which will shew in what manner such a plan may
               be realized without injury to the native beauty of these scenes. </p>

            <p>I have been treating of the erection of houses or mansions suited to a grand and beautiful
               region; and I have laid it down as a position that they should be “not obvious, nor
               obtrusive, but retired;” and the reasons for this, though they have been little adverted
               to, are evident. Mountainous countries more frequently and forcibly than others, remind
               us of the power of the elements as it is exhibited in winds, snows, and torrents,
               and accordingly make the notion of exposure very unpleasing; while shelter and comfort
               are in proportion necessary and acceptable. Far-winding vallies, which are difficult
               of access, and our feelings of simplicity which are habitually connected with mountain
               retirements, prompt us to turn from ostentation as a thing there eminently unnatural
               and out of place. A mansion amid such scenes can never have sufficient dignity or
               interest to become principal in the landscape and render the mountains, lakes, or
               torrents, by which it may be surrounded, a subordinate part of the view; nor are the
               grand features of nature to be absorbed by the puny efforts of human art. It is, I
               grant, easy to conceive that an ancient castellated mansion hanging over a precipice
               or raised upon an island or the peninsula of a lake, like that of Kilchurn Castle
               near Loch <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/25_0.jpg">[p. 25]</a> Awe, may not want, whether deserted or inhabited, that majesty which shall enable
               it to preside for a moment in the spectator’s thoughts over the high mountains among
               which it is embosomed; but its titles are from antiquity—a power which is readily
               submitted to upon occasions as the viceregent of Nature; it is respected as having
               owed its existence to the necessity of things—as a monument of security in times of
               disturbance and danger long passed away—as a record of the pomp and violence of passion,
               and a symbol of the wisdom of law—it bears a countenance of authority which is not
               impaired by decay. These honours render it worthy of its situation; and to which of
               these honours can a modern edifice pretend? Obtruding itself in rivalry with the grandeur
               of Nature, it only displays the presumption and caprice of its individual founder,
               or the class to which he belongs. But, in a flat or merely undulating country, a Gentleman’s
               Mansion may with propriety become a principal feature in the landscape; and, itself
               being a work of art, works and traces of artificial ornament may without censure be
               extended around it, as they will be referred to the common centre, the house; the
               right of which to impress within certain limits a character of obvious ornament will
               not be denied, where there are no conspicuous or commanding forms of Nature to dispute
               it or set it aside. Now to a want of the perception of this difference, and to the
               causes before assigned, may chiefly be attributed the disfigurement which the Country
               of the Lakes has undergone from persons who may have built, demolished, and planted,
               with full confidence that every change and addition was or would become an improvement.</p>
            <p>The principle which ought to determine the position, apparent size, and architecture
               of a house, viz., that it should be so constructed, and (if large) so much of it hidden,
               as to admit of its being gently incorporated with the scenery of Nature—should also
               determine its colour. Sir Joshua Reynolds used to say “if you would fix upon the best
               colour for your house, turn up a stone, or pluck up a handful of grass by the roots,
               and see what is the colour of the soil where the house is to stand, and let that be
               your choice.” Of course the precept, given in conversation, could not have been meant
               to be taken literally. For example in Low Furness, where the soil from its strong
               impregnation with iron is universally of a deep red, if this rule were strictly followed,
               the house also must be of a glaring red; in other places it must be of a sullen black;
               which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance. The rule however, as a general
               guide, is good; and in agricultural districts where large tracts of soil are laid
               bare by the plough, particularly if (the face of the country being undulating) they
               are held up to view, this rule, though not to be implicitly adhered to, should never
               be lost sight of, that is, the colour of the house ought, if possible, to have a cast
               or shade of the colour of the soil. The principle is that the house must harmonize
               with the surrounding landscape; accordingly, in mountainous countries, with still
               more confi- <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/26_0.jpg">[p. 26]</a> dence may it be said, “look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the
               soil is visible, and they will furnish a safe general direction.” Nevertheless, it
               will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the
               landscape, and may be of such a tone of colour that the rule may not even here admit
               of being implicitly followed. For instance, the chief defect in the colouring of the
               Country of the Lakes (which is most strongly felt in the summer season) is an over-prevalence
               of a bluish tint, which the green of the herbage, the fern, and the woods, does not
               sufficiently counteract. This blue tint proceeds from the diffused water, and still
               more from the rocks which the reader will remember are generally of this colour. If
               a house therefore should stand where this defect prevails, I have no hesitation in
               saying that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that could
               be chosen. A tint ought to be introduced approaching nearer to those which, in the
               technical language of painters, are called <em>warm</em>: this, if happily selected, would not disturb, but would animate the landscape. How
               often do we see this exemplified upon a small scale by the native cottages, in cases
               where the glare of white wash has been subdued by time and enriched by weather-stains.
               No harshness is then seen; but one of these cottages thus coloured, will often form
               a central point to a landscape by which the whole shall be connected, and the influence
               of pleasure diffused over all the objects of which the picture is composed. Where
               however the cold blue tint of the rocks is animated by hues of the iron tinge, the
               colour cannot be too closely imitated; and it will be produced of itself by the stones
               hewn from the adjoining quarry, and by the mortar which may be tempered with the most
               gravelly part of the soil. But, should the mason object to this, as they will do,
               and insist upon the mortar being tempered by blue gravel from the bed of the river,
               and say that the house must be rough-cast, otherwise it cannot be kept dry, then the
               builder of taste will set about contriving such means as may enable him to come the
               nearest to the effect aimed at.</p>
            <p>The supposed necessity of rough-cast to keep out rain in houses not built of hewn
               stone or brick, has tended greatly to injure English landscape, and the neighbourhood
               of these Lakes especially, by furnishing such an apt occasion for whitening buildings.
               I will therefore say a few words upon this subject; because many persons, not deficient
               in taste, are admirers of this colour for rural residences. The reasons are manifold;
               first, as is obvious, the air of cleanliness and neatness which is thus given not
               only to an individual house, but, where the practice is general, to the whole face
               of the country; which moral associations are so powerful that, in the minds of many,
               they take place of every other relating to such objects. But what has been already
               said upon the subject of cottages must have convinced men of feeling and imagination,
               that a human habitation of the humblest class may be rendered more deeply interesting
               to the affections, and far more pleasing to the <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/27_0.jpg">[p. 27]</a> eye, by other influences than by a sprightly tone of colour spread over its outside.
               I do not however mean to deny that a small white building, embowered in trees, may
               in some situations be a delightful and animating object—in no way injurious to the
               landscape; but this only where it sparkles from the midst of a thick shade, and in
               rare and solitary instances; especially if the country be in itself rich and pleasing
               and full of grand forms. On the sides of bleak and desolate moors, one is indeed thankful
               for the sight of white Cottages and white houses plentifully scattered, where without
               these perhaps every thing would be chearless: this is said however with hesitation,
               and in the sleep of some of the higher faculties of the mind. But I have certainly
               seen such buildings glittering at sunrise and in wandering lights with no common pleasure.
               The continental Traveller also will remember that the Convents hanging from the rocks
               of the Rhine, the Rhone, the Danube, or among the Appenines or the Mountains of Spain,
               are not looked at with less complacency when, as is often the case, they happen to
               be of a brilliant white. But this is perhaps owing, in no small degree, to the contrast
               of that lively colour with the feeling of gloom associated with monastic life, and
               to the general want of rural residences of smiling and attractive appearance in those
               countries.</p>
            <p>The objections to white as a colour in large spots or masses in landscape, especially
               in a mountainous country, are insurmountable. In nature it is scarcely ever found
               but in small objects, such as flowers; or in those which are transitory, as the clouds,
               foam of rivers, and snow. Mr. Gilpin, who notices this, has also recorded the just
               remark of Mr. Locke of N—— that white destroys the <em>gradations</em> of distance, and therefore an object of pure white can scarcely ever be managed with
               good effect in landscape painting. Five or six white houses, scattered over a valley,
               by their obtrusiveness dot the surface and divide it into triangles or other mathematical
               figures which haunt the eye and disturb that repose which might otherwise be perfect.
               I have seen a single white house materially impair the majesty of a mountain, cutting
               away by a harsh separation the whole of the base below the point on which the house
               stood. Thus was the apparent size of the mountain reduced not by the interposition
               of another object in a manner to call forth the imagination, which will give more
               than the eye loses; but what had been abstracted in this case was left visible; and
               the mountain appeared to take its beginning or to rise from the line of the house
               instead of its own natural base. But, if I may express my own individual feeling,
               it is after sunset at the coming on of twilight that white objects are most to be
               complained of. The solemnity and quietness of nature at that time is always marred
               and often destroyed by them. When the ground is covered with snow, they are inoffensive;
               and in moonshine they are always pleasing—it is a tone of light with which they accord;
               and the dimness of the scene is enlivened by an object at once conspicuous and chearful.
               I will con- <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/28_0.jpg">[p. 28]</a> clude this subject with noticing that the cold slaty colour, which many persons who
               have heard the white condemned have adopted in its stead, must be disapproved of for
               the reason already given. The flaring yellow runs into the opposite extreme, and is
               still more censurable. Upon the whole, the safest colour for general use is something
               between a cream and a dust colour commonly called stone-colour—there are among the
               Lakes examples of this which need not be pointed out.</p>
            <p>The principle which we have taken for our guide, viz., that the house should be so
               formed and of such apparent size and colour as to admit of its being gently incorporated
               with the scenery of nature, should also be applied to the management of the grounds
               and plantations, and is here more urgently needed; for it is from abuses in this department,
               far more even than from the introduction of <em>exotics</em> in architecture, (if the phrase may be used) that this country has suffered. Larch
               and fir plantations have been spread every where, not merely with a view to profit,
               but in many instances for the sake of ornament. To those who plant for profit, and
               are thrusting every other tree out of the way to make room for their favourite the
               Larch, I would utter first a regret that they should have selected these lovely vales
               for their vegetable manufactory, when there is so much barren and irreclaimable land
               in other parts of the Island which might have been had for this purpose at a far cheaper
               rate. And I will also beg leave to represent to them that they ought not to be carried
               away by flattering promises from the speedy growth of this tree; because, in rich
               soils and sheltered situations, the wood, though it thrives fast, is full of sap,
               and of little value, and is likewise very subject to ravage from the attacks of insects
               and from blight. Accordingly in Scotland, where planting is much better understood,
               and carried on upon an incomparably larger scale than among us, good soil and sheltered
               situations are appropriated to the oak, the ash, and other native deciduous trees;
               and the larch is now generally confined to barren and exposed ground. There the plant,
               which is a hardy one, is of slower growth; much less liable to the injuries which
               I have mentioned; and the timber is of better quality. But there are many whose circumstances
               permit them, and whose taste leads them, to plant with little regard to profit; and
               others less wealthy who have such a lively feeling of the native beauty of these scenes,
               that they are laudably not unwilling to make some sacrifices to heighten it. Both
               these classes of persons I would entreat to enquire of themselves wherein that beauty
               which they admire consists. They would then see that, after the feeling has been gratified
               which prompts us to gather round our dwelling a few flowers and shrubs which, from
               the circumstance of their not being native, may, by their very looks, remind us that
               they owe their existence to our hands and their prosperity to our care, they will
               see that, after this natural desire has been provided for, <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/29_0.jpg">[p. 29]</a> the course of all beyond has been predetermined by the spirit of the place. Before
               I proceed with this subject, I will prepare my way with a remark of general application
               by reminding those, who are not satisfied with the restraint thus laid upon them,
               that they are liable to a charge of inconsistency when they are so eager to change
               the face of that country, the native attractions of which by the art of erecting their
               habitations in it they have emphatically and conspicuously acknowledged. And surely
               there is not in this country a single spot that would not have, if well managed, sufficient
               dignity to support itself unaided by the productions of other climates or by elaborate
               decorations which might be becoming elsewhere.</p>
            <p>But to return; having adverted to the considerations which justify the introduction
               of a few exotic plants, provided they be confined almost to the doors of the house,
               we may add, that a transition should be contrived without abruptness from these foreigners
               to the rest of the shrubs, which ought to be of the kinds scattered by nature through
               the woods—holly, broom, wild rose, elder, dogberry, white and black thorn, &amp;c., either
               these only, or such as are carefully selected in consequence of their uniting in form,
               and harmonizing in colour with them, especially, with respect to colour, when the
               tints are most diversified, as in autumn and spring. The various sorts of fruit and
               blossom-bearing trees usually found in orchards, to which may be added those of the
               woods; the wilding, black cherry tree, and wild cluster cherry (here called heck-berry)
               may be happily admitted as an intermediate link between the shrubs and the forest
               trees; which last ought almost entirely to be such as are natives of the country,
               oak, ash, birch, mountain ash, &amp;c. &amp;c. Of the birch, one of the most beautiful of
               the native trees, it may be noticed, that, in dry and rocky situations, it outstrips
               even the larch which many persons are tempted to plant merely on account of the speed
               of its growth. Sycamore, and the Scotch fir (which, when it has room to spread out
               its arms, is a noble tree) may be placed with advantage near the house; for, from
               their massiveness, they unite well with buildings, and in some situations with rocks
               also; having in their forms and apparent substances, the effect of something intermediate
               betwixt the immovableness and solidity of stone and the sprays and foliage of the
               lighter trees. If these general rules be just, what shall we say to whole acres of
               artificial shrubbery and exotic trees among rocks and dashing torrents with their
               own wild wood in sight—where we have the whole contents of the nursery-man’s catalogue
               jumbled together—colour at war with colour, and form with form—among the most peaceful
               subjects of nature’s kingdom every where discord, distraction, and bewilderment! But
               this deformity, bad as it is, is not so obtrusive as the small patches and large tracts
               of larch plantations which are over-running the hill-sides. To justify our condemnation
               of these, let us again recur to nature. The process by which she forms woods and forests,
               is as follows. Seeds are scattered <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/30_0.jpg">[p. 30]</a> indiscriminately by winds, brought by waters, and dropped by birds. They perish or
               produce, according as the soil upon which they fall is suited to them; and under the
               same dependence the seedling or sucker, if not cropped by animals, thrives, and the
               tree grows, sometimes single, taking its own shape without constraint, but for the
               most part being compelled to conform itself to some law imposed upon it by its neighbours.
               From low and sheltered places vegetation travels upwards to the more exposed; and
               the young plants are protected, and to a certain degree fashioned, by those which
               have preceded them. The continuous mass of foliage which would thus be produced is
               broken by rocks or by glades or open places where the brouzing of animals has prevented
               the growth of wood. As vegetation ascends, the winds begin also to bear their part
               in moulding the forms of the trees; but, thus mutually protected, trees, though not
               of the hardiest kind, are enabled to climb high up the mountains. Gradually however,
               by the nature of the ground and by increasing exposure, as top is put to their ascent;
               the hardy trees only are left; these also, by little and little, give way; and a wild
               and irregular boundary is established, which, while it is graceful in its outline,
               is never contemplated without some feeling more or less distinct of the powers of
               nature by which it has been imposed.</p>
            <p>Contrast the liberty and law under which this is carried on, as a joint work of nature
               and time, with the disheartening necessities, restrictions, and disadvantages, under
               which the artificial planter must proceed, even he whom long observation and fine
               feeling have best qualified to tread in the path of nature. In the first place his
               trees, however well chosen and adapted to their several situations, must generally
               all start at the same time; and this circumstance would of itself prevent that fine
               connection of parts, that sympathy and organization, if I may so express myself, which
               pervades the whole of a natural wood, and which appears to the eye in its single trees,
               its masses of foliage, and their various colours when they are held up to view on
               the side of a mountain; or, when spread over a valley, they are looked down upon from
               an eminence. It is then impossible under any circumstances for the artificial planter
               to rival the beauty of nature. But a moment’s thought will shew that, if ten thousand
               of this spiky tree, the larch, are stuck in at once upon the side of a hill, they
               can grow up into nothing but deformity; that, while they are suffered to stand, an
               absolute and insurmountable obstacle will prevent the realization of any of those
               appearances which we have described as the chief cause of the beauty of a natural
               wood.</p>
            <p>It must be acknowledged that the larch, till it has outgrown the size of a shrub,
               has, when looked at singly, some elegance in its form and appearance, especially in
               spring when decorated by the pink tassels of its blossoms; but as a tree, it is less
               than any other pleasing; its branches (for <em>boughs</em> it has none) have no variety in the youth of the tree, and little dignity even when
               it attains its full growth;  <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/31_0.jpg">[p. 31]</a> <em>leaves</em> it cannot be said to have; consequently neither affords shade, nor shelter. In spring
               it becomes green long before the native trees; and its green is so peculiar and vivid,
               that, finding nothing to harmonize with it, it makes a speck and deformity in the
               landscape. In summer when all other trees are in their pride, it is of a dingy lifeless
               hue, and in winter appears absolutely dead. In this respect it is lamentably distinguished
               from every other tree of the forest. If an attempt be made to mingle thickets, or
               a certain proportion of other forest trees, with the larch,—its horizontal branches
               intolerantly cut them down as with a scythe or force them to spindle up to keep pace
               with it. The spike, in which it terminates, renders it impossible, when it is planted
               in numbers, that the several trees should ever blend together so as to form a mass
               or masses of wood. Add thousands to tens of thousands, and the appearance is still
               the same—a collection of separate individual trees which obstinately present themselves
               as such; and, from whatever point they are looked at, if but seen, may be counted
               upon the fingers. Sunshine or shadow has little power to adorn the surface of such
               a wood; and the trees not carrying up their heads, the wind produces among them no
               majestic undulations. It is indeed, true that, in countries where the larch is a native,
               and where without interruption it may sweep from valley to valley and from hill to
               hill, a sublime image may be produced by such a forest in the same manner as by one
               composed of any other single tree to the spreading of which no limits can be assigned.
               For sublimity will never be wanting, where the sense of innumerable multitude is lost
               in, and alternates with, that of intense unity; and to the ready perception of this
               effect similarity and almost identity of individual form and monotony of colour contribute.
               But this feeling is confined to the native immeasurable forest; no artificial plantation
               can give it.</p>
            <p>The foregoing observations will, I hope, (as nothing has been condemned or recommended
               without a substantial reason) have some influence upon those who plant for ornament
               mainly. To those, who plant for profit, I have already spoken. Let me then entreat
               that the native deciduous trees may be left in complete possession of the lower ground;
               and that plantations of larch, if introduced at all, may be confined to the higher
               and more barren tracts. Interposition of rocks would there break the dreary uniformity
               of which we have been complaining; and the winds would take hold of the trees, and
               imprint upon their shapes a wildness congenial to their situation.</p>
            <p>Having determined what kinds of trees must be wholly rejected, or at least very sparingly
               used by those who are unwilling to disfigure the country; and having shewn what kinds
               ought to be chosen; I should have given, if I had not already overstepped my limits,
               a few practical rules for the <em>manner</em> in which trees ought to be disposed in planting. But to this subject I should attach
               little importance, if I could succeed in banishing such trees as introduce deformity,
               and could prevail <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/32_0.jpg">[p. 32]</a> upon the Proprietor to confine himself either to those which form the native woods,
               or to such as accord with them. This is indeed the main point; for, much as these
               scenes have been injured by what has been taken from them—buildings, trees and woods,
               either through negligence, necessity, avarice, or caprice—it is not these removals,
               but the harsh <em>additions</em> that have been made, which are the worst grievance—a standing and unavoidable annoyance.
               Often have I felt this distinction with mingled satisfaction and regret; for if no
               positive deformity or discordance be substituted or superinduced, such is the benignity
               of nature that, take away from her beauty after beauty and ornament after ornament,
               her appearance cannot be lastingly marred;—the scars, if any be left, will gradually
               disappear before a healing spirit; and what remains will still be soothing and pleasing.—“Many
               hearts;” says a living Poet speaking of a noble wood which had been felled in an interesting
               situation; </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">

            <p>There are few ancient woods left in this part of England upon which such indiscriminate
               ravage could now be committed. But out of the numerous copses fine woods might in
               time be raised, probably without any sacrifice of profit, by leaving at the periodical
               fellings a due proportion of the healthiest trees to grow up into timber.—This plan
               has fortunately, in many instances, been adopted; and they, who have set the example,
               are entitled to the thanks of all persons of taste. As to the management of planting
               with reasonable attention to ornament, let the images of nature be your guide, and
               the whole secret lurks in a few words; thickets or underwoods—single trees—trees clustered
               or in groups—groves—unbroken woods, but with varied masses of foliage—glades—invisible
               or winding boundaries—in rocky districts a seemly proportion of rock left wholly bare,
               and other parts half hidden—disagreeable objects concealed, and formal lines broken—trees
               climbing up to the horizon, and in some places ascending from its sharp edge in which
               they are rooted, with the whole body of the tree appearing to stand in the clear sky—in
               other parts woods surmounted by rocks utterly bare and naked, which add to the sense
               of height as if vegetation could not thither be carried, and impress a feeling of
               duration, power of resistance, and security from change.</p>
            <p>I have been induced to speak thus at length with a wish to preserve the native beauty
               of this delightful district, because still farther changes in its appearance must
               inevitably follow, from the change of inhabitants and owners which is rapidly <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/33_0.jpg">[p. 33]</a> taking place.—About the same time that strangers began to be attracted to the country,
               and to feel a wish to settle in it, the difficulty, which would have stood in the
               way of their procuring situations, was lessened by an unfortunate alteration in the
               circumstances of the native Peasantry, proceeding from a cause which then began to
               operate, and is now felt in every house. The family of each man, whether estatesman
               or farmer, formerly had a twofold support; first, the produce of his lands and flocks;
               and secondly the profit which was drawn from the employment of the women and children,
               as manufacturers; spinning their own wool in their own houses (which was done chiefly
               in the winter season) and carrying it to market for sale. Hence, however numerous
               the children, the income of the family kept pace with its increase. But, by the invention
               and universal application of machinery, this second resource has been almost wholly
               cut off; the gains being so far reduced, as not to be sought after but by a few aged
               persons disabled from other employment. Doubtless the invention of machinery has not
               been to these people a pure loss; for the profits arising from home-manufactures operated
               as a strong temptation to choose that mode of labour in neglect of husbandry. They
               also participate in the general benefit which the Island has derived from the increased
               value of the produce of land, brought about by the establishment of manufactories,
               and in the consequent quickening of agricultural industry. But this is far from making
               them amends; and now, that home-manufactures are nearly done away, though the women
               and children might at many seasons of the year employ themselves with advantage in
               the fields beyond what they are accustomed to do, yet still all possible exertion
               in this way cannot be rationally expected from persons whose agricultural knowledge
               is so confined, and above all where there must necessarily be so small a capital.
               The consequence, then, is—that, farmers being no longer able to maintain themselves
               upon small farms, several are united into one, and the buildings go to decay or are
               destroyed; and that the lands of the estatesmen being mortgaged and the owners constrained
               to part with them, they fall into the hands of wealthy purchasers, who in like manner
               unite and consolidate; and if they wish to become residents, erect new mansions out
               of the ruins of the ancient cottages whose little enclosures, with all the wild graces
               which grew out of them and around them, disappear. The feudal tenure of these estates
               has indeed done something towards checking this influx of new settlers; but so strong
               is the inclination that these galling restraints are endured; and it is probable that
               in a few years the country of the Lakes will fall almost entirely into the possession
               of Gentry, either strangers or natives. It is then much to be wished, that a better
               taste should prevail among these new proprietors; and, as they cannot be expected
               to leave things to themselves, that skill and knowledge should prevent unnecessary
               deviations from that path of simplicity and beauty in which, without design and unconsciously,
               their humble predecessors have moved. In this wish the author will be <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/34_0.jpg">[p. 34]</a> joined by persons of pure taste throughout the whole Island, who by their visits,
               often repeated, to the Lakes to the North of England, testify that they deem the district
               a sort of national property, in which every man has a right and interest who has an
               eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy.</p>
            <p>The Writer may now express a hope that the end, which was proposed in the commencement
               of this Introduction, has not been wholly unattained; and that there is no impropriety
               in connecting these latter remarks with the Etchings now offered to the public. For
               it is certain that, if the evil complained of should continue to spread, these Vales,
               notwithstanding their lakes, rivers, torrents, and surrounding rocks and mountains,
               will lose their chief recommendation for the eye of the painter and the man of imagination
               and feeling. And, upon the present occasion, the Artist is bound to acknowledge that,
               if the fruit of his labours have any value, it is owing entirely to the models which
               he has had before him, in a country which retained till lately an appearance unimpaired
               of <span class="smallcaps">Man</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Nature</span> animated, as it were, by one spirit for the production of beauty, grace, and grandeur.</p>

            </header>
            <p><span class="smallcaps">In</span> the Introduction to this Work a survey has been given of the face of the country,
               in which our English Lakes are situated which will not perhaps prove unserviceable
               even to Natives and Residents, however well acquainted with its appearance; as it
               will probably direct their attention to some objects which they have overlooked, and
               will exhibit others under relations of which they have been unconscious. I will now
               address myself more particularly to the Stranger and the Traveller; and, without attempting
               to give a formal Tour through the country, and without binding myself servilely to
               accompany the Etchings, I will attach to the Work such directions, descriptions, and
               remarks, as I hope will confer an additional interest upon the Views, and will also
               be of use to a person preparing for a first visit to these scenes, and during his
               progress through them.—To begin then with the time which he ought to choose;—Mr. West
               recommends the interval from the beginning of June to the end of August; and the two
               latter months, being a season of vacation and leisure, are those which are generally
               selected; but they are by no means the best; for the disadvantages belonging to them
               are many and great. The principal are, the monotonous green of the Mountains and of
               the Woods, and the embrowned colour of the grass in the Vallies. This however is variegated
               and enlivened after hay-making begins, which is much later than in the southern parts
               of the Island. An objection which will be more strongly felt, is rainy weather, which
               often sets in at this period with a vigour, and continues with a perseverance, that
               may remind the disappointed and dejected Traveller of the wet season between the Tropics;
               or of those deluges of rain which fall among the Abyssinian Mountains for the annual
               supply of the Nile. Hence, as a very large majority of strangers visit the Lakes at
               this season, the country labours under the ill repute of being scarcely ever free
               from rain.—The months of September and October, (particularly October) are generally
               attended with much finer weather; and the scenery is then, beyond comparison, more
               diversified, more splendid and beautiful; but, on the other hand, short days prevent
               long excursions, and sharp and chill gales are unfavorable to parties of pleasure
               out of doors. Nevertheless the beauty of this country in Autumn so far surpasses that
               of Midsummer, that to the sincere admirer of Nature, who is in good health and spirits
               and at liberty to make a choice, the six weeks following the first of September may
               be recommended in preference to July and August.—For there is no inconvenience arising
               from the Season which to such a person would not be amply recompensed by the <em>Autumnal</em> appearance of any of the more retired Vallies, into which discordant plantations
               and unsuitable buildings have not yet found entrance.—In such spots at this season,
               there is an admirable and affecting compass and proportion of natural harmony in form
               and colour, through the whole scale of objects; in the tender green of the after-grass
               upon the meadows interspersed with islands of grey or mossy rocks crowned by shrubs
               and trees; in the irregular inclosures of standing corn or stubble-fields in like
               manner broken; in the mountain-sides glowing with fern of divers colours; in the calm
               blue Lakes or River-pools; and in the foliage of the trees through all the tints of
               Autumn, from the pale and brilliant yellow of the birch and ash to the deep greens
               of the unfaded oak and the alder, and of the ivy upon the rocks, the trees, and the
               cottages. Yet as most travellers are either stinted or stint themselves for time,
               I would recommend the space between the middle or last week in May and the middle
               or last week of June as affording the best combination of long days, fine weather,
               and variety of impressions. Few of the native trees are indeed then in full leaf,
               but for whatever may be wanting in depth of shade, far more than an equivalent will
               be found in the diversity of foliage, in the blossoms of the fruit- and berry-bearing
               Trees which abound in the woods, and in the golden flowers of the broom and other
               shrubs, with which many of the copses are variegated. In those woods, also, and on
               those mountain-sides which have a northern aspect, and in the deep dells, many of
               the earlier spring-flowers still linger; while the open and sunny places are stocked
               with the flowers of approaching summer. And, besides, is not an exquisite pleasure
               still untasted by him who has not heard the <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/36_0.jpg">[p. 36]</a> choir of Linnets and Thrushes chaunting their love-songs in the copses, woods, and
               hedge-rows, of a mountainous country; safe from the birds of prey, which build in
               the inaccessible crags, and are at all hours seen or heard wheeling about in the air?
               The number of those formidable Creatures is the cause why in the narrow vallies there
               are no sky-larks; as the Destroyer would be enabled to dart upon them from the near
               and surrounding crags, before they could descend to their ground nests, for protection.
               Neither are Nightingales here to be heard; but almost all the other tribes of our
               English warblers are numerous; and their notes, when listened to by the side of broad
               still waters, or when heard in unison with the murmuring of mountain brooks, have
               much more power over the heart, and the imagination than in other places.—There is
               also an imaginative influence in the voice of the Cuckoo, when that voice has taken
               possession of a deep mountain Valley, which is very different from any thing which
               can be excited by the same sound in a flat country. Nor must I omit a circumstance
               which here renders the close of Spring especially interesting; I mean the practice
               of bringing down the Ewes from the Mountains, to yean in the Vallies and enclosed
               grounds.—The springing herbage being thus cropped, that first tender and emerald green
               of the season, which would otherwise last little more than a fortnight, is prolonged
               in the pastures and meadows for many weeks; while they are farther enlivened by the
               multitude of lambs bleating and skipping about; which, as they gather strength, are
               turned out upon the open mountains, and with their slender limbs, their snow white
               colour, and their wild and light motions, beautifully accord or contrast with the
               lawns and rocks, upon and among which they must now begin to seek their food. But,
               what is of most consequence, the Traveller at this season would be almost sure of
               having fine weather.—The opinion which I have given concerning the comparative advantages
               of the different times for visiting these Lakes, is founded upon a long acquaintance
               with the Country, and an intimate knowledge of its appearance at all seasons. But,
               I am aware that few of those, who may be satisfied with the reasons, by which this
               opinion is supported, will be able to profit from what has been said; as the time
               and manner of an excursion of this kind are mostly regulated by circumstances which
               prevent an entire freedom of choice. It will therefore be more pleasant to me to observe
               that, though the months of July and August are liable to the objections which have
               been mentioned, yet it not unfrequently happens that the weather, at this time, is
               not more wet or stormy than they, who are really capable of enjoying the sublime forms
               of Nature in their height of sublimity, would desire. For no Traveller, provided he
               is in good health and with any command of time, would have a just privilege to visit
               such scenes, if he could grudge the price of a little confinement among them or interruption
               in his journey from the sight or sound of a storm coming-on or clearing-away; and
               he would congratulate himself upon the bold bursts of sunshine, the descending vapours,
               and wandering lights and shadows, the invigorated torrents and water-falls, with which
               broken weather, in a mountainous region, is accompanied.—At such a time the monotony
               of midsummer colouring, and the want of variety caused by this, and by the glaring
               atmosphere of long, cloudless and hot days, is wholly removed.</p>

            </header>
            <p>It is obvious that the point, from which a Stranger should begin this Tour, and the
               order in which it will be convenient to him to see the different Vales will depend
               upon this circumstance; viz: from what quarter of the Island he comes. If from Scotland,
               or by the way of Stainmoor, it will suit him to start from Penrith, taking the scenery
               of Lowther in his way to Hawes-water. He will next visit Ullswater, &amp;c. reversing
               the order which I shall point out as being in itself the best. Mr. West has judiciously
               directed those to whom it is convenient to proceed from Lancaster over the sands to
               take Furness Abbey in their way, if so inclined; and then to advance by the Lake of
               Coniston. This is unquestionably the most favourable approach. The beautiful Lake
               of Coniston will thus be traced upwards from its outlet, the only way in which it
               can be seen, for the first time, without an entire yielding up of its most delightful
               appearances. And further, the Stranger, from the moment he sets his foot upon the
               Sands, seems to leave the turmoil and the traffic of the world behind him; and crossing
               the majestic Plain from which the Sea has retired, he beholds, rising apparently from
               its base, that cluster of Mountains, among the recesses of which he is going to wander,
               and into which, by the Vale of Coniston, he is gradually and peacefully introduced.
               The Lake and Vale of Coniston, approached in this manner, improve in appearance with
               every step. And I may here make this general remark, which, indeed the Reader may
               have deduced from the representation of the Country, given in the Introduction, that,
               wherever it is possible, these Lakes and Vallies should be approached from the foot;
               otherwise most things will come upon the Spectator to great disadvantage. This general
               rule applies, though not with equal force to all the Lakes, with the single exception
               of Lowes-water, which, lying in a direction opposite to the rest, has its most favourable
               aspects determined accordingly.</p>
            <p>At the head of Coniston close to the water side is a small and comfortable Inn, which
               I would advise the Traveller, who is not part of a large company, and who does not
               look for a parade of accommodation, to make his head-quarters for two days. The first
               of these days, if the weather permit, may be agreeably passed in an excursion to the
               Vale of Duddon, or Donnerdale, as part of it is called, and which name may with propriety
               be given to the whole. It lies over the high hill which bounds the Vale of Coniston
               on the West. This Valley is very rarely visited; but I recommend it with confidence
               to the notice of the Traveller of taste and feeling. It will be best approached by
               a road, ascending from near the church of Coniston, which leads to that part of Donnerdale
               called Seathwaite. The road is so long and steep that the Traveller will be obliged
               to lead his horse a considerable part of it. The ascent and descent cannot I think
               be less than five miles; but, nothing can be found more beautiful than the scene,
               into which he will be received at the bottom of the hill on the other side. This little
               circular Valley is a collateral compartment of the long winding Vale, through which
               flows the stream of Duddon; and its Brook finds its way to the River. Advancing, you
               will come to the lowly Chapel of Seathwaite, and a field or two beyond, is a Farm-house,
               where, though there be no sign-board, or outward mark of an Inn, the Traveller who
               can content himself with homely diet may be accommodated.—Having satisfied himself
               with strolling about Seathwaite, he will proceed down Donnerdale to Ulpha Kirk; and
               from this Church-yard he will have as grand a combination of mountain lines and forms
               as perhaps this country furnishes. The whole scene is inspirited by the sound and
               sight of the River rolling immediately below the steep ground upon the top of which
               the Church stands. From Ulpha Kirk proceed down the Vale towards Broughton. The same
               character of mingled wildness and cultivation is still preserved. Rocky grounds, which
               must for ever forbid the entrance of the plough, here and there, interrupt the cultivation;
               and in part or wholly fill up the bottom or sides of the Vale.—This beautiful Vale
               does not gradually disappear in a flat Plain, but terminates abruptly in a prospect
               of the Sands of Duddon, and of the Irish Sea. These are seen in conjunction with its
               River, and deep recesses of wood. On this account, and for the sake of descending
               upon Seathwaite so advantageously, I have <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/38_0.jpg">[p. 38]</a> recommended in opposition to the general rule, that it should be approached from
               the upper part, rather than from its outlet. From Broughton return to Coniston by
               the nearest road. The morning of the next day may be employed in sailing upon, and
               looking about the higher part of the Lake, and in strolling upon its Banks; and the
               other half in an excursion to the Valley of Yewdale (a branch of the Vale of Coniston)
               and round the sequestered Valley of Tilberthwaite, which may be considered as a remoter
               apartment of the Valley of Yewdale. This excursion may be about five miles, and may
               be taken either on foot or horse-back; but not in a carriage. From the Valley of Yewdale
               having mounted to that of Tilberthwaite, with the Brook upon the right hand, pursue
               the road till it leads to the furthest of two Cottages; there, ask the way through
               the fields to an house called Holm-ground. If, on horse-back, alight there; and from
               a rocky and woody hill, behind the house you will look down upon this wild, beautiful,
               and singularly secluded Valley. From Holm-ground return to the Inn at Coniston. Next
               day proceed to Hawkshead; and thence by the side of Estwaite looking back a little
               while after the road has left the Lake side upon a fine view (which will be found
               among these Etchings) of the Lake of Estwaite. Thence, through the two Villages of
               Sawrey, you come to the Ferry-house upon Windermere where are good accommodations
               for the night.</p>
            <p>The Tourist has now reached Windermere, and has been introduced in his road to some
               sequestered spots not exemplified in these Etchings, but, which, if he wishes to have
               a complete knowledge of the various features of this Country, he will be glad to have
               visited. Every thing that is of consequence has been taken in its best order, except
               that the first burst of the Vale of Windermere, though very interesting from this
               approach, is much inferior to that which would have come upon him had he descended
               by the road from Kendal. Before the Traveller, whom I have thus far accompanied, enters
               the Peninsula, at the extremity of which the Ferry House stands, it will be adviseable
               to ascend to a Pleasure-house belonging to J.C. Curwen, Esq. which he will see upon
               the side of the rocks on his left hand.—There is a gate, and a person, attending at
               a little Lodge, or Cot adjoining, who will conduct him. From this point he will look
               down upon the cluster of Islands in the central part of the Lake, upon Bowness, Rayrigg,
               and the Mountains of Troutbeck; and will have a prospect of the lower division of
               this expanse of water to its extremity. The upper part is hidden. The Pleasure house
               is happily situated, and is well in its kind, but, without intending any harsh reflections
               on the contriver, from whom it was purchased by its present Proprietor, it may be
               said that he, who remembers the spot on which this building stands, and the immediate
               surrounding grounds as they were less than thirty years ago, will sigh for the coming
               of that day when Art, through every rank of society, shall be taught to have more
               reverence for Nature. This scene is, in its natural constitution, far too beautiful
               to require any exotic or obtrusive embellishments, either of planting or architecture.
               With Winandermere a large majority of Visitants begin this Tour. The ordinary course
               is from Kendal, by the nearest road to Bowness; but I would recommend it to all persons,
               whatever may be their mode of conveyance, or however large their party, when they
               shall have reached the Turnpike-house, about a mile beyond Kendal, not to take, as
               is commonly done, the road which leads directly to Bowness; but that through Stavely;
               inasmuch as the break of prospect from Orrest-head, where the road brings you to the
               first sight of Windermere, in itself one of the finest things in the Tour, is much
               grander than as it appears from the other road. This for two reasons; first, that
               you are between two and three miles nearer the sublime mountains and large expanse
               of water at the head of the Lake; and secondly that the new houses and plantations,
               and the number of trim and artificial objects with which the neighbourhood of Bowness
               is crouded, are so far removed from this point, as not to be individually offensive,
               as they melt into the general mass of the Landscape. At the bottom of the hill, you
               find a Guide-post; and, turning, abruptly to the left, will immediately come in sight
               of the same general prospect which has been seen above, from a point, which, as it
               is comparatively low, necessarily changes the character of the scene. Thence on, through
               the close woods of Rayrigg, to the bustling Inn of Bowness.</p>
            <p>I will not call upon the Reader to waste his time upon descriptions of things, which
               every one makes a point of seeing, and of such as lie open to the notice of the most
               inattentive Traveller. This, with respect to a country now so well known, would be
               useless in itself; and would be especially improper in a publication of this kind,
               the main purport of which is, to exhibit scenes which lie apart from the beaten course
               of observation.—Accordingly I shall chiefly expatiate upon those retired spots, which
               have furnished subjects for the majority of these Etchings, or upon others of the
               same character; and when I treat of the more frequent scenes, I shall attempt little
               more than to point out <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/39_0.jpg">[p. 39]</a> qualities by which they are characterized, which may easily escape the notice of
               the cursory Spectator. The appearance of the neighbourhood of Bowness, within the
               last five and thirty years, has undergone many changes, and most of these for the
               worse, for want of due attention to those principles of taste, and those rules for
               planting and building in a country of this kind, which have been discussed at large
               in the Introduction. The Islands of Windermere are beautifully shaped and intermingled.
               Upon the largest are a few fine old trees; but a great part of this delightful spot,
               when it first fell into the Improver’s hand, was struck over with trees that are here
               out of place; and, had the present public-spirited Proprietor sufficient leisure amidst
               his important avocations to examine the principles which have been enforced in these
               pages, he would probably be induced to weed these foreigners out by little and little,
               and introduce more appropriate trees in their stead; such as would be pleasing to
               look at in their youth, and in maturity and old age might succeed to those venerable
               natives which the axe has spared. The embankment also, which has been raised round
               this Island for the sake of preserving the land, could only, it should seem, have
               been necessary in a few exposed points; and the artificial appearance which this has
               given to the whole spot is much to be regretted; not to speak of the infinite varieties
               of minute beauty which it must have destroyed. Could not the margin of this noble
               Island be given back to Nature? Winds and Waves work with a careless and graceful
               hand; and any thing which they take away would be amply compensated by the additional
               spirit, dignity and loveliness which these agents and the other powers of Nature would
               soon communicate to what was left behind.</p>
            <p>Windermere ought to be seen both from its shores and from its surface. None of the
               other Lakes unfold so many fresh beauties to him who sails upon them. This is owing
               to its greater size, to its Islands, and to a circumstance in which this Lake differs
               from all the rest, viz. that of having two Vales at its head, with their accompanying
               mountains of nearly equal dignity. Nor can the whole grandeur of these two terminations
               be seen at the same time from any one point, except from the bosom of the Lake. The
               Islands may be explored at any time of the day; but one bright unruffled evening at
               least, must, if possible, be set apart for the splendour, the stillness and solemnity
               of a three hours voyage upon the higher division of the Lake, not omitting, towards
               the end of the excursion, to quit the expanse of water, and peep into the close and
               calm River at the head; which, in its quiet character, at such a time, appears rather
               like an overflow of the peaceful Lake itself than to have any more immediate connection
               with the rough mountains from which it has descended, or the turbulent Torrents of
               which it is composed. Many persons content themselves with what they see of Windermere
               in their progress in a boat from Bowness to the head of the Lake, walking thence to
               Ambleside; but this is doing things by halves. The whole road from Bowness is rich
               in diversity of pleasing or grand scenery; there is scarcely a field on the road side
               which, if it were entered, would not give to the Landscape some additional charm.
               Low-wood Inn, a mile from the head of Windermere is a pleasant halting-place; and
               the fields above it, and the lane which leads to the Troutbeck, present beautiful
               views towards each extremity of the Lake. From this place, and still more conveniently
               from Ambleside, rides on horse-back or in carriages may be taken in almost every direction,
               and the interesting walks are inexhaustible.</p>

            </header>
            <p>This Town or Market-village was formerly perhaps more rich in picturesque beauty,
               arising from a combination of rustic architecture and natural scenery than any small
               Town or Village in Great Britain. Many of the ancient buildings with their porches,
               projections, round chimnies and galleries have been displaced to make way for the
               docked, featureless, and memberless edifices of modern architecture; which look as
               if fresh brought upon wheels from the Foundry, where they had been cast. Yet this
               Town, if carefully noticed, will still be found to retain such store of picturesque
               materials as will secure the praise of what it once was from any suspicion of partiality.
               The Brook, which divides the Town ought to be explored along its channel; if the state
               of the stream will permit. Below the Bridge is a Mill, and also an old Summer-house,
               with other old buildings, ivied Trunks of Trees, and mossy Stones, which have furnished
               subjects for many a picture; and above the Bridge, though there are no Buildings,
               every step is interesting till the curious Traveller is stopped by the huge breastwork
               of Stock-gill Force. Within a quarter of a mile of Ambleside is a scene called the
               Nook, which deserves to be explored. It is to be found in Scandle Gill, the channel
               of the first Brook that comes down Scandle Fell to the North of Ambleside. I need
               not describe the scene; its prin- <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/40_0.jpg">[p. 40]</a> cipal feature is a Bridge thrown over the Torrent. From this Bridge I wish it were
               in my power to recommend it to the Traveller to proceed northwards, along the slope
               of the hill-side, till he reaches the Park of Rydale; but this would be a trespass;
               for there is no path, and high and envious stone walls interpose. We must therefore
               give up the best approach to some of the most glorious scenes in the world; this may
               be yet said, though not without painful regret for the havoc which has been made among
               them. Some hundreds of oaks are gone, </p>

            <p> a majestic Forest covering a mountain side! into the recesses of which penetrated
               like a vision, Landscapes of rivers, broad waters, vallies, rocks and mountains:—The
               Lake of Rydale on the North-west, with its Islands and rocky steeps, circular and
               deeply embosomed; and to the South the long Valley of Ambleside and the gleaming Lake
               of Windermere. The noblest of these trees have been sacrificed; but the side of the
               hill, though thinned, is not wholly laid bare; and the Herons and Rooks that hover
               round this choice retreat have yet a remnant of their ancient roosting-place. The
               unfrequented spots, of which I have been speaking may be visited, with permission
               from the Mansion, after the Water-fall has been seen.</p>
            <p>Of places at a distance from Ambleside, but commodiously visited from that Village,
               Coniston may be first mentioned; though this Lake as I said before, will thus be approached
               to great disadvantage.—Next comes Great Langdale, a Vale which should on no account
               be missed by him who has a true enjoyment of grand separate Forms composing a sublime
               Unity, austere but reconciled and rendered attractive to the affections by the deep
               serenity that is spread over every thing. There is no good carriage road through this
               Vale; nor ought that to be regretted; for it would impair its solemnity; but the road
               is tolerable for about the distance of three miles from Ambleside, namely along the
               Vale of Brathay, and above the western banks of Loughrigg Tarn, and still further,
               to the entrance of Langdale itself; but the small and peaceful Valley of Loughrigg
               is seen to much greater advantage from the eastern side. When therefore you have quitted
               the River Brathay enquire at the first house for the foot road, which will conduct
               you round the lower extremity of the Tarn, and so on to its head, where, at a little
               distance from the Tarn the path again leads to the publick road and about a mile further
               conducts you to Langdale Chapel.—A little way beyond this sequestered and simple place
               of worship is a narrow passage on the right leading into a slate-quarry which has
               been finely excavated. Pursuing this road a few hundred yards further, you come in
               view of the noblest reach of this Vale, which I shall not attempt to describe. Under
               the Precipice adjoining to the Pikes lies invisibly Stickle Tarn, and thence descends
               a conspicuous Torrent down the breast of the Mountain. Near this Torrent is Dungeon
               Gill Force, which cannot be found without a Guide, who may be taken up at one of the
               Cottages at the foot of the Mountain. </p>

            <p> At the head of Langdale is a passage over to the Borrowdale; but this ought on no
               account to be taken by a person who has not seen the main features of the country
               from their best approaches.—If the Traveller has been zealous enough to advance as
               far as Dungeon-gill Force, let him enquire for Blea Tarn; he may return by that circuit
               to Ambleside. Blea Tarn is not an object of any beauty in itself, but it is situated
               in a small, deep circular Valley of peculiar character; for it contains only one Dwelling-house
               and two or three cultivated fields. Passing down this Valley fail not to look back
               now and then, and you will see Langdale Pikes, from behind the rocky steeps that form
               its north-eastern boundary, lifting themselves, as if on tip-toe, to pry into it.
               Quitting the Valley you will descend into little Langdale, and thence may proceed
               by Colwith Force and Bridge. Leaving Skelwith-Bridge on your left ascend with the
               road to Skelwith; and from a field on the northern side of that small cluster of houses,
               you will look down upon a grand view of the River Brathay, Elter-water and the mountains
               of Langdale, &amp;c. Thence proceed occasionally looking, down the Brathay on the side
               of the River opposite to that by which you had ascended in your way to Louthrigg Tarn.
               The whole of this excursion may be as much as 18 miles, and would require a <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/41_0.jpg">[p. 41]</a> long morning to be devoted to the accomplishment. I will now mention only one more
               ride or walk from Ambleside. Go to the Bridge over the Rothay (of which a view is
               given in the Etchings), between Ambleside and Clappersgate. When you have crossed
               the Bridge, turn to a Gate on the right hand, and proceed with the road up the Valley
               of Ambleside, till you come opposite to the Village of Rydale; do not cross over to
               Rydale, but keep close to the Mountain on your left hand, with the River at a little
               distance on your right, till you come in view of Rydale Lake. Advance with the Lake
               on your right till you quit the Vale of Rydale, and come in view of Grasmere. Follow
               the road, which will conduct you round along the lower extremity of the Lake of Grasmere,
               till you reach the Church; thence into the main road back to Ambleside, looking behind
               you frequently.</p>
            <p>The two hours before sun-set are the most favourable time of the day for seeing the
               lower division of Wytheburne Lake, but it is advisable to choose the earlier part
               of this time, in order that the Traveller may be enabled to descend into the Vale
               of Keswick while the sun-beams are upon it. That this first impression of that Vale
               should be received under the most favourable circumstances, is very desirable; and
               therefore I do not recommend, as I should otherwise have done, that the Traveller,
               who has been guided by my directions thus far, should lengthen his journey to Keswick
               still further, and follow the stream that issues out of Wytheburn Lake till it enters
               St. John’s Vale, which he may do if he be on foot, keeping to the side of it almost
               all the way; and, if on horseback, he may return to it by a small circuit, after having
               crossed Shoulthwaite Moss. I should have directed the Traveller in this case to proceed
               a mile and a half down St. John’s Vale, and then to cross Naddle Fell, by St. John’s
               Chapel, which would bring him into the road between Ambleside and Keswick, something
               better than two miles short of the latter place. This may easily be done, taking the
               lower division of Wytheburn earlier in the afternoon than the time which I have recommended
               as the best.</p>
            <p>We have now reached Keswick. I shall not attempt a general description of this celebrated
               Vale, because this has already been admirably performed by Dr. Brown, and by the Poet
               Gray; and the place is at this time very generally known. As the Views in this work
               have been taken almost exclusively from retired spots in the <em>Ghylls</em>, or Gills, and smaller Vallies that branch off from the trunk of the Vale, it will
               be more appropriate to this publication, and will better suit its narrow limits, to
               say a few words upon them. And to begin with one of the smallest, Applethwaite (for
               Views of which see <span class="smallcaps">Nos</span>. 22, 23, and 24). This is a hamlet of six or seven houses, hidden in a small recess
               at the foot of Skiddaw, and adorned by a little Brook, which, having descended from
               a great height in a silver line down the steep blue side of the Mountain, trickles
               past the doors of the Cottages. This concealed spot is very interesting as you approach
               from the bottom, with your face towards the green and blue mass of Skiddaw; and is
               not less pleasing when, having advanced by a gentle slope for some space, you turn
               your head and look out from this chink or fissure, which is sprinkled with little
               orchards and trees, and behold the whole splendour of the upper and middle part of
               the Vale of Keswick, with its Lakes and Mountains spread before your eyes. A small
               Spinning-mill has lately been erected here, and some of the old Cottages, with their
               picturesque appendages, are fallen into decay. This is to be regretted; for, these
               blemishes excepted, the scene is a rare and almost singular combination of minute
               and sequestered beauty, with splendid and extensive prospects. On the opposite side
               of the Vale of Keswick lie the Valley of Newlands, and the Village of Braithwaite,
               with its stream descending from a cove of the Mountain. From both these spots I have
               given Views, from which an idea of their features may be collected. Braithwaite lies
               at the foot of Whenlater, in the road to Lorton and Cockermouth; and through Newlands
               passes the nearest road to Buttermere. Returning to the eastern side of the Vale of
               Keswick, we find the narrow and retired Valley of Watenlath, enclosed on each side
               and at the head by craggy Mountains. In the Mountains at the head, the stream rises,
               which forms the Cascade of Lodore. This, after flowing a short way through a pastoral
               tract, falls into a small Lake or Tarn, which lies midway in the long Valley of Watenlath.
               At the point where the stream issues out of the Tarn, is a beautiful Bridge of one
               arch, and close beside the Bridge is a little Hamlet, a cluster of grey Cottages.
               There are no other dwellings in the Valley; and a more secluded spot than this Hamlet
               cannot well be conceived; yet ascend a very little up the hill above it, and you have
               a most magnificent prospect of the Vale of Keswick, as far as Skiddaw; and, pursuing
               the Valley of Watenlath to its head, if you look back, the view of the little Valley
               itself, with its Lake, Bridge, and Cottages, is combined with that of the majestic
               Vale beyond, so that each seems to be a part of the other. But the most considerable
               of the Dales which communicate with the Vale of Keswick by the Rivers which flow through
               them, are Borrowdale and St. John’s. Of St. John’s we have already spoken; and Borrowdale
               is in fact the head of the Vale of Keswick. It would be an <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/42_0.jpg">[p. 42]</a> endless task to attempt, by verbal descriptions, to guide the traveller among the
               infinite variety of beautiful or interesting objects which are found in the different
               reaches of the broad Valley itself, nor less so to attempt to lead him through its
               little recesses, its nooks, and tributary glens. I must content myself with saying,
               that this Valley surpasses all the others in variety. Rocks and Woods are intermingled
               on the hill-sides with profuse wildness; and on the plain below (for the area of the
               Valley, through all its windings is generally a level plain, out of which the Mountains
               rise as from their base,) the single Cottages and clusters of Houses are numerous;
               not glaringly spread before the eye, but unobtrusive as the rocks themselves, and
               mostly coloured like them. There is scarcely a Cottage that has not its own tuft of
               trees. The Yew-tree has been a favourite with the former Inhabitants of Borrowdale;
               for many fine old Yew-trees yet remain near the Cottages, probably first planted for
               an ornament to their gardens, and now preserved as a shelter, and for the sake of
               their venerable appearance. But the noblest Yew-trees to be found here, are a cluster
               of three, with a fourth a little detached, which do not stand in connection with any
               houses; they are in that part of Borrowdale which is called Seathwaite, immediately
               under the entrance into the Lead-mines. Nothing of the kind can be conceived more
               solemn and impressive than the small gloomy grove formed by these trees.</p>
            <p>The lower part of the Vale of Keswick is occupied by the Lake of Bassenthwaite; and
               he who coasts its western shore, will be well and variously recompensed; and in particular
               by the appearance of Skiddaw, rising immediately from the opposite side of the Lake.
               Following this road, we cross the lower extremity of Embleton Vale. Embleton may be
               mentioned as the last of the Vallies collateral to the main Vale of Keswick. It unfolds
               on the west, near the foot of Bassenthwaite Lake, a scene of humble and gentle character;
               but deriving animated beauty from the Lake, and striking majesty from the Mountain
               of Skiddaw, which is on this side broken and rugged, and of an aspect which is forcibly
               contrasted with that with which it looks upon Derwent Lake. The view of the whole
               vista of the Vale of Keswick from Armathwaite and Ouze Bridge is magnificent; and
               the scenes upon the River Derwent, as far as the grand ruins of Cockermouth Castle,
               are soft and varied, and well worthy of the notice of the Pedestrian, who has leisure
               to go in search of them.</p>
            <p>From the Vale of Keswick, of which there is no need to say any thing more, the Tourist
               usually proceeds to Buttermere, to which there are three roads; the one through part
               of Borrowdale, which brings him down into the Vale of Buttermere, at its head; but
               Borrowdale I suppose to have been already explored, a strong reason against choosing
               this approach. Yet in justice to this road I must add, that the descent into Gatesgarth,
               immediately under Honister Crag, causes one of the sublimest impressions which this
               country can produce. The second road leads through Newlands. The descent into Buttermere
               by this way is solitary and grand; but the Vale of Newlands itself I suppose also
               to have been visited in the Tour round the Lake of Keswick (which no person of taste
               ought to omit), or in other rambles. It follows, then, that the third is the road
               which I would recommend, namely, the carriage road, which leads over Whinlater, through
               part of the Vale of Lorton, to the outlet of Crummock-water. Here was formerly an
               inn, kept at a house called Scale Hill, an accommodation which I believe no longer
               exists. It would, however, be ill-judged not to turn aside to Scale Hill; the carriage
               or horses might be sent forward by the high-road, and ordered to wait till the Traveller
               rejoined them by the footpath, which leads through the woods along the side of Crummock.
               This path presents noble scenes, looking up the Lake towards Buttermere. If the Traveller
               be desirous of visiting Lowes-water, instead of proceeding directly along this path,
               he must cross the Bridge over the Cocker, near Scale Hill, to which he must return
               after a walk or ride of three or four miles. I am not sure that the circuit of this
               Lake can be made on horseback; but every path and field in the neighbourhood would
               well repay the active exertions of the Pedestrian. Nor will the most hasty Visitant
               fail to notice with pleasure, that community of attractive and substantial houses
               which are dispersed over the fertile inclosures at the foot of those rugged Mountains,
               and form a most impressive contrast with the humble and rude dwellings which are usually
               found at the head of these far-winding Dales. It must be mentioned also, that there
               is scarcely any thing finer than the view from a boat in the centre of Crummock-water.
               The scene is deep, and solemn, and lonely; and in no other spot is the majesty of
               the Mountains so irresistibly felt as an omnipresence, or so passively submitted to
               as a spirit incumbent upon the imagination. Near the head of Crummock-water, on the
               right, is Scale Force, a Waterfal worthy of being visited, both for its own sake,
               and for the sublime View across the Lake, looking back in your ascent towards the
               Chasm. The Fall is perpendicular from an immense height, a slender stream faintly
               illuminating a gloomy fissure. This spot is never seen to a more advantage than when
               it happens, that, while you are looking up <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/43_1.jpg">[p. 43]</a> through the Chasm towards the summit of the lofty Waterfal, large fleecy clouds,
               of dazzling brightness, suddenly ascend into view, and disappear silently upon the
               wind. The Village of Buttermere lies a mile and a half higher up the Vale, and of
               the intermediate country I have nothing to say. It would be advisable, if time permit,
               that you should go as far up the Vale as Honister Crag; and if in horseback, or on
               foot, you may return to Keswick by Newlands.</p>
            <p>The rest of the scenes in this part of the country of which I have given views, namely,
               those of Ennerdale and Westdale, cannot, without a good deal of trouble, be approached
               in a carriage. For Foot-travellers, and for those who are not afraid of leading their
               horses through difficult ways, there is a road from Buttermere directly over the mountains
               to Ennerdale; there is also another road from the head of Buttermere to the head of
               Westdale, without going into Borrowdale; but both Ennerdale and Westdale are <em>best</em> seen by making a considerable circuit; namely, by retracing our steps to Scale Hill,
               and thence by Lowes-water and Lamplugh to Ennerdale. The first burst of Ennerdale
               from an eminence is very noble, and the mind is more alive to the impression, because
               we have quitted for a while the heart of the mountains, and been led through a tamer
               country. Ennerdale is bold and savage in its general aspect, though not destitute,
               towards the higher part of the Lake, of fertile and beautiful spots. From Ennerdale-Bridge
               to Calder-Bridge, the road leads over Cold Fell. The distance is six miles, a desolate
               tract, with the exception of the last half mile, through a narrow and well-wooded
               Valley, in which is a small, but beautiful fragment of Calder Abbey. The village lying
               close to Calder-Bridge has good inns, and the bed of the River about the Bridge is
               rocky and spirited. We are here in a plain country near to the sea, and therefore
               better prepared to enjoy the mountain sublimities of Westdale, which soon begin to
               shew themselves, and grow upon us at every step, till we reach the margin of the Lake.
               This Water (for the Lakes are generally called <em>Waters</em> by the country people) is not so much as four miles in length, and becomes very narrow
               for the space of half a mile towards its outlet. On one side it is bordered by a continued
               straight line of high and almost perpendicular steeps, rising immediately from the
               Lake, without any bays or indentings. This is a very striking feature; for these steeps,
               or <em>screes</em> (as places of this kind are named), are not more distinguished by their height and
               extent, than by the beautiful colours with which the pulverized rock, for ever crumbling
               down their sides, overspreads them. The surface has the apparent softness of the dove’s
               neck, and (as was before mentioned, in reference to spots of this kind,) resembles
               a dove’s neck strongly in its hues, and in the manner in which they are intermingled.
               On the other side, Wast-water is bordered by knotty and projecting rocky mountains,
               which, retiring in one place, admit the interposition of a few green fields between
               them and the Lake, with a solitary farmhouse. From the termination of the Screes rises
               Scaw Fell, deemed higher than Skiddaw, or Helvellyn, or any of the Mountains. The
               summit, as seen from Westdale, is bold and abrupt, and if you should quit the Valley
               and ascend towards it, it appears, from the Cove beneath, like the shattered walls
               or towers of an enormous edifice. Upon the summit of one of those towers is a fragment
               of rock that looks like an eagle, or a large owl, on that commanding eminence, stationary
               through all seasons. The Views which I have given are from the shore about the middle
               of Wast-water, from a point where the Vale appears to be terminated by three large
               conical Mountains, Yewbarrow on the left, Great Gavel in the centre, and Lingmoor
               on the right. About two miles further is the Division of West-dale Head, with its
               lowly Chapel. This place formerly consisted of twenty tenements. It is now reduced
               to six. This Valley has been described in the Introduction, as seen from the summit
               of Great Gavel; but the Traveller will be pleased with a nearer view of these pastoral
               dwellings, which in the inside are as comfortable as their outside is beautiful and
               picturesque. A hospitable people live here, and do not repine at the distance and
               the barriers which separate them from the noisy world. Give them more sunshine and
               a richer soil, and they would have little to complain of. The Stranger will observe
               here and elsewhere large heaps of stones, like Sepulchral Barrows, which have been
               collected from the fields and thrown together by the labours of many generations.
               From the summits either of Great Gavel, or Scaw Fell, there are sublime prospects.
               Great Gavel may be proud of the Vallies which it looks down into, and Scaw Fell of
               the dark multitudinous Mountains, rising ridge above ridge, which it commands on the
               one side, and of the extent of sea and sand spreading in a level plain on the other.
               The ascent of Scaw Fell is easy, that of Great Gavel laborious. I cannot deny myself
               the pleasure of adding, that on the highest point of Great Gavel is a small triangular
               receptacle of water in a rock. It is not a spring; yet the shepherds say that it is
               never dry: certainly when I was there, during a season of drought, it was well supplied
               with water. Here the Traveller may slake his thirst plenteously with a pure and celestial
               beverage; for it appears that this cup or bason has no other <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/44_0.jpg">[p. 44]</a> feeder than the dews of heaven, the showers, the vapours, the hoar frost, and the
               spotless snow. From Wastdale return to Keswick by Stye-Head and Borrowdale. Take a
               look backwards upon Wastdale, from the last point where it is visible. The long strait
               vista of the Vale, and the sea beyond, apparent between the Mountains, form a grand
               whole. A few steps further bring you to Stye-Head Tarn (for which see No. 43). By
               the side of the Tarn, an eagle (I believe of the ospray species) was killed last spring.
               Though large, it was very light, and seemed exhausted by hunger. The stream which
               flows into this Tarn comes from another, called Sprinkling Tarn, famous among anglers
               for the finest trouts in the country. In rainy seasons there is a magnificent waterfal
               formed by the stream which issues from Stye-Head Tarn. You have it on your left as
               you descend into Seathwaite division of Rovendale. About a mile further down upon
               the left is that cluster of yew-tress recommended to notice; thence through a succession
               of magnificent scenes to Keswick.</p>
            <p>It remains that we should speak of Ullswater. There are two roads by which this Lake
               may be visited from Keswick. That which is adapted for Travellers on horseback, or
               on foot, crosses the lower part of St. John’s Vale, and brings you down through the
               Valley and scattered Village of Matterdale into Gowbarrow Park, unfolding at once
               a magnificent view of the two higher reaches of the Lake. Airey Force thunders down
               the <em>Ghyll</em>, or Gill, on the left, at a small distance from the road; but you are separated from
               it by the Park-wall. In a carriage, Ullswater is best approached from Penrith. A mile
               and a half brings you to the winding Vale of Emont, and the prospects increase in
               interest till you reach Patterdale; but the first four miles along Ullswater by this
               road are comparatively tame, and in order to see the lower part of the Lake to advantage,
               it is absolutely necessary to go round by Poolly-Bridge, and to ride at least three
               miles along the Westmoreland side of the Water, towards Martindale. The Views from
               this quarter, especially if you ascend from the road into the fields, are magnificent;
               yet I only mention this that the transient Traveller may know what exists; for it
               will be very inconvenient for him to go in search of them. The person who takes this
               course of three or four miles, which I am now recommending, <em>on foot</em>, should take care to have a boat in readiness at the end of his walk, to carry him
               right across to the Cumberland side, along which he may pursue his way upwards to
               Patterdale.</p>
            <p>Having conducted the Traveller hither, I shall treat no further of the body of this
               celebrated Vale; but, for the same reasons which governed me when I was speaking of
               Keswick, I shall confine myself to the Glens and Vallies which branch off from it.</p>
            <p>At Dalemain, about three miles from Penrith, a Stream is crossed, called Dacre, which,
               rising in the moorish country about Penruddock, flows down a soft sequestered Valley,
               passing by the ancient mansions of Hutton John and Dacre Castle. The former is pleasantly
               situated, though of a character somewhat gloomy and monastic; and from some of the
               fields near Dalemain, Dacre Castle, backed by the jagged summit of Saddleback, and
               with the Valley and Stream in front of it, forms a grand picture. There is no other
               stream that conducts us to any glen or valley worthy of being mentioned, till you
               reach the one which leads you up to Airey Force, and then into Matterdale, before
               spoken of. Matterdale, though a wild and interesting spot, has no peculiar features
               that would make it worth the Stranger’s while to go in search of them; but in Gowbarrow
               Park the lover of Nature might wish to linger for hours. Here is a powerful Brook,
               which dashes among rocks through a deep glen, hung on every side with a rich and happy
               intermixture of native wood; here are beds of luxuriant fern, aged hawthorns, and
               hollies decked with honeysuckles; and fallow-deer glancing and bounding over the lawns
               and through the thickets. These are the attractions of the retired views, or constitute
               a fore-ground to ever-varying pictures of the majestic Lake, forced to take a winding
               course by bold promontories, and environed by mountains of sublime form, towering
               above each other. Having passed under a plantation of larches, we reach, at the outlet
               of Gowbarrow Park, a third Stream, which flows through a little recess called Glencoin,
               in which lurks a single house, yet visible from the road. Let the Artist and leisurely
               Traveller turn aside to it for the buildings, and the objects around them are both
               romantic and exquisitely picturesque. Having passed under the steeps of Styebarrow
               Crag, and the remains of its native woods, you cross, at Glenridding-Bridge, a fourth
               Stream, which, if followed up, would lead to Red Tarn and the recesses of Helvellyn.
               The opening on the side of Ullswater Vale, down which the Stream flows, is adorned
               with fertile fields, cottages, and natural groves, which agreeably coalesce with the
               transverse views of the Lake; and the Stream, if followed up after the enclosures
               are left behind, will lead along bold water-breaks and waterfals to a silent Tarn
               in the recesses of Helvellyn. This desolate spot was formerly haunted by eagles, that
               built in the precipice which forms its western barrier. These birds used to wheel
               and hover round the head of the solitary angler. It also now derives a melancholy
               interest from the <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/45_0.jpg">[p. 45]</a> fate of a young man, a stranger, who perished here a few years ago, by falling down
               the rocks in his attempt to cross over to Grasmere. His remains were discovered by
               means of a faithful dog, which had lingered here for the space of three months, self
               supported, and probably retaining to the last an attachment to the skeleton of its
               dead master. But to return to the road which we have left in the main Vale of Ullswater.—At
               the head of the Lake (being now in Patterdale) we cross a fifth Stream, Grisdale Beck;
               this conducts through a woody steep, where may be seen some unusually large ancient
               hollies, up to the level area of the Valley of Grisdale; hence there is a path for
               Foot-travellers, and along which a horse may be led, but not without difficulty, to
               Grasmere. I know not any where a more sublime combination of mountain forms than those
               which appear in front, as we ascend along the bed of this Valley; and the impression
               increases with every step till the path grows steep; and as we climb almost immediately
               under the projecting masses of Helvellyn, the mind is overcome with a sensation, which
               in some would amount to personal fear, and cannot but be awful even to those who are
               most familiar with the images of duration, and power, and other kindred influences,
               by which mountainous countries controul or exalt the imaginations of men. It is not
               uninteresting to know, that in the last house but one of this Valley, separated, as
               it might seem, from all the ambition and troubles of the world, from its wars and
               commotions, was born the youth, who, in Spain, took prisoner the Colonel of the Imperial
               Guard of Buonaparte. This favourite of the tyrant fled from the assault of our British
               mountaineer with his two attendants, who escaped; but he himself was not so fortunate.
               Having retraced the banks of this stream to Patterdale, and pursued our way up the
               main Dale, the next considerable stream which we cross, would, if ascended in the
               same manner, conduct us into Deepdale, the character of which Valley may be conjectured
               by its name. It is terminated by a cove, a craggy and gloomy abyss, with precipitous
               sides; a faithful receptacle of the snows, which are carried into it, by the west
               wind, from the summit of Fairfield. Lastly, having gone along the western side of
               Brothers-water and passed Hartsop Hall, we are brought soon after to a stream which
               issues from a cove richly decorated with native wood. This spot is, I believe, never
               explored by Travellers; but whether from these sylvan and rocky recesses you look
               back on the gleaming surface of Brothers-water, or forward to the precipitous sides
               and lofty ridges of the mountains, you will be equally pleased with the beauty, the
               grandeur, and the wildness of the scenery.</p>
            <p>We have thus noticed no less than seven Glens, or Vallies, which branch off from the
               western side of the long Vale which we have been ascending. The opposite side has
               only two streams of any importance, one of which flows by the Village of Hartsop,
               near the foot of Brothers-water, and the other, coming down Martindale, enters Ullswater
               at Sandwyke, opposite to Gowbarrow Park. Of Martindale I shall say a few words, but
               I must first return to our head-quarters at the Village of Patterdale. No persons,
               but such as come to this place merely to pass through it, should fail to walk a mile
               and a half down the side of the Lake opposite to that on which the high-road lies;
               they should proceed beyond the point where the inclosures terminate. I have already
               had too frequent reason to lament the changes which have been made in the face of
               this country; and scarcely any where has a more grievous loss been sustained than
               upon the Farm of Blowick, the only enclosed land which on this side borders the higher
               part of the Lake. The axe has indiscriminately levelled a rich wood of birches and
               oaks, which, two or three years ago, varied this favoured spot into a thousand pictures.
               It has yet its land-locked bays and promontories; but now those beautiful woods are
               gone, which clothed its lawns and <em>perfected</em> its seclusion. Who, then, will not regret that those scenes, which might formerly
               have been compared to an inexhaustible volume, are now spread before the eye in a
               single sheet, magnificent indeed, but seemingly perused in a moment? From Blowick,
               a narrow tract, by which a horse may be led, but with difficulty, conducts along the
               cragged side of Place Fell, richly adorned with juniper, and sprinkled over with birches,
               to the Village of Sandwyke; a few straggling houses, which, with the small estates
               attached to them, occupy an opening opposite to Lyulph’s Tower and Gowbarrow Park.
               This stream flows down Martindale, a Valley deficient in richness, but interesting
               from its seclusion. In Vales of this character the general want of wood gives a peculiar
               interest to the scattered cottages, embowered in sycamores; and few of the Mountain
               Chapels are more striking than this of Martindale, standing as it does in the centre
               of the Valley, with one dark yew-tree, and enclosed by “a bare ring of mossy wall.”
               The name of Boardale, a bare, deep, and houseless Valley, which communicates with
               Martindale, shews that the wild swine were once numerous in that nook; and Martindale
               Forest is yet one of the few spots in England ranged over by red deer. These are the
               descendants of the aboriginal herds. In Martindale, the road loses sight of the Lake,
               and leads over a steep hill, <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/46_0.jpg">[p. 46]</a> bringing you again into view of Ullswater. Its lowest reach, four miles in length,
               is before you; and the View is terminated by the long ridge of Cross Fell at a distance.
               Immediately under the eye is a deep-indented bay, with a plot of fertile land by the
               side of it, traversed by a small brook, and rendered cheerful by two or three substantial
               houses of a more ornamental and shewy appearance than is usual in these wild spots.
               Poolly-Bridge, at the foot of the Lake, to which we have again returned, has a good
               inn; and from this place Hawes-water, which has furnished me with the subject of an
               Etching, may be conveniently visited. Of Hawes-water I shall only say, that it is
               a lesser Ullswater, with this advantage, that it remains undefiled by the intrusion
               of bad taste.</p>
            <p>Lowther Castle is about four miles from Poolly-Bridge, and if during this Tour the
               Stranger has complained, as he will have reason to do, of a want of majestic trees,
               he may be abundantly recompensed for his loss in the far-spreading woods which surround
               that mansion.</p>
            <p>I must now express my hope, that the Reader of the foregoing pages will not blame
               me for having led him through unfrequented paths so much out of the common road. In
               this I have acted in conformity to the spirit of the Etchings, which are chiefly taken
               from sequestered scenes; and these must become every day more attractive in the eyes
               of the man of taste, unless juster notions and more appropriate feelings should find
               their way into the minds of those who, either from vanity, want of judgment, or some
               other cause, are rapidly taking away the native beauties of such parts of this Country
               as are most frequented, or most easy of access; and who are disguising the Vales,
               and the Borders of the Lakes, by an accumulation of unsightly buildings and discordant
               objects.</p>
