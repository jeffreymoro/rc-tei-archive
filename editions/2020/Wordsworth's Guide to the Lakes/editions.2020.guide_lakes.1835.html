               <p class="noCount"><em>A Guide through the District of the Lakes in the North of England</em> (1835) is the best-known version of Wordsworth’s guidebook, the last edition substantially
                  revised by the author, and the one most often reprinted. This electronic edition offers
                  an enriched reading experience of Wordsworth’s definitive text. Its extensive annotations
                  include not only textual notes and content aids but also dozens of illustrations—far
                  more than would be possible in a standard print edition. All live links are indicated
                  by <span class="color(365F91)">blue text</span>. Clicking on a link brings up a box containing an editorial note and, where available,
                  a thumbnail image. An additional click on the thumbnail brings up an enlarged version
                  at higher resolution. Numbered notes are Wordsworth’s own, not the editors’. Readers
                  curious about locations (some two hundred of them) mentioned in the text may also
                  wish to consult this edition’s “<a class="link_ref" href="/editions/guide_lakes/places-map">Mapping the Lakes</a>” appendix, which makes visualizing places and their relationships to each other easier.
               </p> 
               <p class="noCount">This edition does not recreate the typography or pagination of the 1835 edition, but
                  it retains its spelling, punctuation, and so forth, correcting only obvious printer’s
                  errors silently. As the itinerary tables included at the end of the 1835 edition were
                  prepared by Wordsworth’s publishers rather than by the poet, we have chosen not to
                  transcribe them. We have, however, included scanned page images from the 1835 text
                  for reference.

            </header><a id="para1">
               <!--anchor--></a><p>In preparing this Manual, it was the Author's principal wish to furnish a Guide or
               Companion for the <em>Minds</em> of Persons of taste, and feeling for Landscape, who might be inclined to explore
               the District of the Lakes with that degree of attention to which its beauty may fairly
               lay claim. For the more sure attainment, however, of this primary object, he will
               begin by undertaking the humble and tedious task of supplying the Tourist with directions
               how to approach the several scenes in their best, or most convenient, order. But first,
               <a class="colorbox-node" href="n002.html">supposing the approach to be made from the south</a>, and through Yorkshire, there are certain interesting spots which may be confidently
               recommended to his notice, if time can be spared before entering upon the Lake District;
               and the route may be changed in returning.
            </p>
            <p>There are three approaches to the Lakes through Yorkshire; the least adviseable is
               the <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e447">[Page]</span> <a class="colorbox-node" href="n003.html">great north road</a> by Catterick and Greta Bridge, and onwards to Penrith. <a class="colorbox-node" href="n004.html">The Traveller, however, taking this route, might halt at Greta Bridge</a>, and be well recompenced if he can afford to give an hour or two to the banks of
               the Greta, and of the <a class="colorbox-node" href="n005.html">Tees, at Rokeby</a>. <a class="colorbox-node" href="n006.html">Barnard Castle</a> also, about two miles up the Tees, is a striking object, and the main North Road
               might be rejoined at Bowes. Every one has heard of the <a class="colorbox-node" href="n007.html">great fall of the Tees</a> above <a class="colorbox-node" href="n008.html">Middleham</a>, interesting for its grandeur, as the avenue of rocks that leads to it, is to the
               geologist. But this place lies so far out of the way as scarcely to be within the
               compass of our notice. It might, however, be visited by a Traveller on foot, or on
               horseback, who could rejoin the main road upon Stanemoor.
            </p>
            <p>The second road leads through a more interesting tract of country, beginning at Ripon,
               from which place see <a class="colorbox-node" href="n009.html">Fountain's Abbey, and thence by Hackfall, and Masham, to Jervaux Abbey</a>, and up the vale of Wensley; turning aside before Askrigg is reached, to see <a class="colorbox-node" href="n010.html">Aysgarth-force</a>, upon the Ure; and again, near Hawes, to <a class="colorbox-node" href="n011.html">Hardraw Scar</a>, of which, with its waterfall, Turner has a fine drawing. Thence over the fells to
               Sedbergh, and Kendal.
            </p>
            <p>The third approach from Yorkshire is through Leeds. Four miles beyond that town are
               the ruins of <a class="colorbox-node" href="n012.html">Kirkstall Abbey</a>, should that road to Skipton be chosen; but the other by Otley may be made much more
               interesting by turning off at Addington to Bolton Bridge, for the <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e484">[Page]</span> sake of visiting the Abbey and grounds. It would be well, however, for a party previously
               to secure beds, if wanted, at the inn, as there is but one, and it is much resorted
               to in summer.
            </p>
            <p>The Traveller on foot, or horseback, would do well to follow the banks of the Wharf
               upwards, to Burnsall, and thence cross over the hills to <a class="colorbox-node" href="n013.html">Gordale</a>—a noble scene, beautifully described in <a class="colorbox-node" href="n015.html">Gray's Tour</a>, and with which no one can be disappointed. Thence to Malham, where there is a respectable
               village inn, and so on, by <a class="colorbox-node" href="n014.html">Malham Cove</a>, to Settle.
            </p>
            <p>Travellers in carriages must go from Bolton Bridge to Skipton, where they rejoin the
               main road; and should they be inclined to visit Gordale, a tolerable road turns off
               beyond Skipton. Beyond Settle, under <a class="colorbox-node" href="n016.html">Giggleswick Scar, the road passes an ebbing and flowing well</a>, worthy the notice of the Naturalist. Four miles to the right of Ingleton, is <a class="colorbox-node" href="n017.html">Weathercote Cave</a>, a fine object, but whoever diverges for this, must return to Ingleton. Near <a class="colorbox-node" href="n018.html">Kirkby Lonsdale observe the view from the bridge over the Lune</a>, and descend to the channel of the river, and by no means omit looking at the <a class="colorbox-node" href="n019.html">Vale of Lune from the Church-yard</a>.
            </p>
            <p>The journey towards the lake country through Lancashire, is, with the exception of
               the Vale of the Ribble, at Preston, uninteresting; till you come near Lancaster, and
               obtain a view of the fells and mountains of Lancashire and Westmorland; with <a class="colorbox-node" href="n020.html">Lancaster Castle</a>, and the <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e516">[Page]</span> Tower of the Church seeming to make part of the Castle, in the foreground.
            </p>
            <p>They who wish to see the celebrated ruins of <a class="colorbox-node" href="n021.html">Furness Abbey</a>, and are not afraid of crossing <a class="colorbox-node" href="n022.html">the Sands</a>, may go from Lancaster to Ulverston; from which place take the direct road to Dalton;
               but by all means return through <a class="colorbox-node" href="n023.html">Urswick, for the sake of the view from the top of the hill</a>, before descending into the grounds of <a class="colorbox-node" href="n024.html">Conishead Priory</a>. From this quarter the Lakes would be advantageously approached by Coniston; thence
               to Hawkshead, and by the Ferry over Windermere, to Bowness: a much better introduction
               than by going direct from Coniston to Ambleside, which ought not to be done, as that
               would greatly take off from the effect of Windermere.
            </p>
            <p>Let us now go back to Lancaster. The direct road thence to Kendal is 22 miles, but
               by making a circuit of eight miles, the Vale of the Lune to Kirkby Lonsdale will be
               included. The whole tract is pleasing; there is one view mentioned by Gray and Mason
               especially so. In <a class="colorbox-node" href="n025.html">West's Guide</a> it is thus pointed out:— “About a quarter of a mile beyond the third mile-stone,
               where the road makes a turn to the right, there is a gate on the left which leads
               into a field where the station meant, will be found.” Thus far for those who approach
               the Lakes from the South.
            </p>
            <p>Travellers from the North would do well to go from Carlisle by Wigton, and proceed
               along the Lake of Bassenthwaite to Keswick; or, if<span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e540">[Page]</span> convenience should take them first to Penrith, it would still be better to cross
               the country to Keswick, and begin with that vale, rather than with Ulswater. It is
               worth while to mention, in this place, that the banks of the river Eden, about Corby,
               are well worthy of notice, both on account of their natural beauty, and the <a class="colorbox-node" href="n026.html">viaducts which have recently been carried over the bed of the river</a>, and over a neighbouring ravine. In the Church of Wetherby, close by, is <a class="colorbox-node" href="n027.html">a fine piece of monumental sculpture by Nollekins</a>. The scenes of Nunnery, upon the Eden, or rather that part of them which is upon
               Croglin, a mountain stream there falling into the Eden, are, in their way, unrivalled.
               But the nearest road thither, from Corby, is so bad, that no one can be advised to
               take it in a carriage. Nunnery may be reached from Corby by making a circuit and crossing
               the Eden at Armathwaite bridge. A portion of this road, however, is bad enough.

               <p>As much the greatest number of Lake Tourists begin by passing from Kendal to Bowness,
                  upon Windermere, our notices shall commence with that Lake. Bowness is situated upon
                  its eastern side, and at equal distance from each extremity of the Lake of <br/><br/><span class="center">WINDERMERE.</span><br/> The lower part of this Lake is rarely visited, but has many interesting points of
                  view, especially at <a class="colorbox-node" href="n028.html">Storr's Hall</a> and at Fell-foot, where <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e560">[Page]</span> the Coniston Mountains peer nobly over the western barrier, which elsewhere, along
                  the whole Lake, is comparatively tame. To one also who has ascended the hill from
                  Grathwaite on the western side, the Promontory called Rawlinson's Nab, Storr's Hall,
                  and the Troutbeck Mountains, about sunset, make a splendid landscape. The view from
                  the Pleasure-house of the Station near the Ferry has <a class="colorbox-node" href="n029.html">suffered much from Larch plantations</a>; this mischief, however, is gradually disappearing, and the Larches, under the management
                  of the proprietor, Mr. Curwen, are giving way to the native wood. Windermere ought
                  to be seen both from its shores and from its surface. None of the other Lakes unfold
                  so many fresh beauties to him who sails upon them. This is owing to its greater size,
                  to the islands, and to its having <em>two</em> vales at the head, with their accompanying mountains of nearly equal dignity. Nor
                  can the grandeur of these two terminations be seen at once from any point, except
                  from the bosom of the Lake. The Islands may be explored at any time of the day; but
                  one bright unruffled evening, must, if possible, be set apart for the splendour, the
                  stillness, and solemnity of a three hour’s voyage upon the higher division of the
                  Lake, not omitting, towards the end of the excursion, to quit the expanse of water,
                  and peep into the close and calm River at the head; which, in its quiet character,
                  at such a time, appears rather like an overflow of the peaceful Lake <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e569">[Page]</span> itself, than to have any more immediate connection with the rough mountains whence
                  it has descended, or the turbulent torrents by which it is supplied. Many persons
                  content themselves with what they see of Windermere during their progress in a boat
                  from Bowness to the head of the Lake, walking thence to Ambleside. But the whole road
                  from Bowness is rich in diversity of pleasing or grand scenery; there is scarcely
                  a field on the road side, which, if entered, would not give to the landscape some
                  additional charm. Low-wood Inn, a mile from the head of Windermere, is a most pleasant
                  halting-place; no inn in the whole district is so agreeably situated for water views
                  and excursions; and the fields above it, and the lane that leads to Troutbeck, present
                  beautiful views towards each extremity of the Lake. From this place, and from <br/><br/><span class="center">AMBLESIDE,</span><br/> Rides may be taken in numerous directions, and the interesting walks are inexhaustible;

            <p>From this little Vale return towards Ambleside by Great Langdale, stopping, if there
               be time, to see <a class="colorbox-node" href="n035.html">Dungeon-ghyll waterfall.</a></p>
            <p>The Lake of <br/><br/><span class="center">CONISTON</span><br/> May be conveniently visited from Ambleside, but is seen to most advantage by entering
               the country over <a class="colorbox-node" href="n036.html">the Sands</a> from Lancaster. The Stranger, from the moment he sets his foot on those Sands, seems
               to leave the turmoil and traffic of the world behind him; and, crossing the majestic
               plain whence the sea has retired, he beholds, rising apparently from its base, the
               cluster of mountains among which he is going to wander, and towards whose recesses,
               by the Vale of Coniston, he is gradually and peacefully led. From the Inn at the head
               of Coniston Lake, a leisurely Traveller might have much pleasure in looking into Yewdale
               and Tilberthwaite, returning to his Inn from the head of Yewdale by a mountain track
               which has the farm of Tarn Hows, a little on the right: by this road is seen much
               <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e661">[Page]</span>the best view of Coniston Lake from the south. At the head of Coniston Water there
               is an agreeable Inn, from which an enterprising Tourist might go to the Vale of the
               Duddon, over Walna Scar, down to Seathwaite, Newfield, and to the rocks where the
               river issues from a narrow pass into the broad Vale. The stream is very interesting
               for the space of a mile above this point, and below, by Ulpha Kirk, till it enters
               the Sands, where it is overlooked by the solitary Mountain <a class="colorbox-node" href="n037.html">Black Comb</a>, the summit of which, as that experienced surveyor, <a class="colorbox-node" href="n038.html">Colonel Mudge</a>, declared, commands a more extensive view than any point in Britain. Ireland he saw
               more than once, but not when the sun was above the horizon.

            <p>The Tourist may either return to the Inn at Coniston by Broughton, or, by turning
               to the left before he comes to that town, or, which would be much better, he may cross
               from <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e707">[Page]</span> <br/><br/><span class="center">ULPHA KIRK</span><br/> Over Birker moor, to Birker-force, at the head of the finest ravine in the country;
               and thence up the Vale of the Esk, by Hardknot and Wrynose, back to Ambleside. Near
               the road, in ascending from Eskdale, are conspicuous remains of a <a class="colorbox-node" href="n040.html">Roman fortress</a>. Details of the Duddon and Donnerdale are given in the Author's series of <a class="colorbox-node" href="n041.html">Sonnets upon the Duddon and in the accompanying Notes</a>. In addition to its two Vales at its head, Windermere communicates with two lateral
               Vallies; that of Troutbeck, distinguished by the mountains at its head—by picturesque
               remains of cottage architecture; and, towards the lower part, by bold foregrounds
               formed by the steep and winding banks of the river. This Vale, as before mentioned,
               may be most conveniently seen from Low Wood. The other lateral Valley, that of Hawkshead,
               is visited to most advantage, and most conveniently, from Bowness; crossing the Lake
               by the Ferry—then pass the two villages of Sawrey, and on quitting the latter, you
               have a fine view of the Lake of Esthwaite, and the cone of one of the Langdale Pikes
               in the distance.
            </p>
            <p>Before you leave Ambleside give three minutes to looking at a passage of the brook
               which runs through the town; it is to be seen from a garden on the right bank of the
               stream, a few steps above the bridge—the garden at<span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e724">[Page]</span> present is rented by Mrs. Airey.—<a class="colorbox-node" href="n042.html">Stockgill-force</a>, upon the same stream, will have been mentioned to you as one of the sights of the
               neighbourhood. And by a Tourist halting a few days in Ambleside, the <em>Nook</em> also might be visited; a spot where there is a bridge over Scandale-beck, which makes
               a pretty subject for the pencil. Lastly, for residents of a week or so at Ambleside,
               there are delightful rambles over every part of Loughrigg Fell and among the enclosures
               on its sides; particularly about Loughrigg Tarn, and on its eastern side about <a class="colorbox-node" href="n043.html">Fox How</a> and the properties adjoining to the northwards.<br/><br/><span class="center">ROAD FROM AMBLESIDE TO KESWICK.</span></p>
            <p>The <a class="colorbox-node" href="n044.html">Waterfalls of Rydal</a> are pointed out to every one. But it ought to be observed here, that Rydal-mere is
               no where seen to advantage from the <em>main road</em>. Fine views of it may be had from Rydal Park; but these grounds, as well as those
               of <a class="colorbox-node" href="n045.html">Rydal Mount</a> and Ivy Cottage, from which also it is viewed to advantage, are private. A foot road
               passing behind Rydal Mount and under Nab Scar to Grasmere, is very favourable to views
               of the Lake and the Vale, looking back towards Ambleside. The horse road also, along
               the western side of the Lake, under Loughrigg fell, as before mentioned, does justice
               to the beauties of this small mere, of which the Traveller who keeps the high road
               is not at all aware.<span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e752">[Page]</span> <br/><br/><span class="center">GRASMERE.</span></p>
            <p>There are two small Inns in the Vale of Grasmere, one near the Church, from which
               it may be conveniently explored in every direction, and a mountain walk taken up Easedale
               to <a class="colorbox-node" href="n046.html">Easedale Tarn</a>, one of the finest tarns in the country, thence to Stickle Tarn, and to the top of
               Langdale Pikes. See also the Vale of Grasmere from Butterlip How. A boat is kept by
               the innkeeper, and this circular Vale, in the solemnity of a fine evening, will make,
               from the bosom of the Lake, an impression that will be scarcely ever effaced.
            </p>
            <p>The direct road from Grasmere to Keswick does not (as has been observed of Rydal Mere)
               shew to advantage <a class="colorbox-node" href="n047.html">Thirlmere</a>, or Wythburn Lake, with its surrounding mountains. By a Traveller proceeding at leisure,
               a deviation ought to be made from the main road, when he has advanced a little beyond
               the sixth mile-stone short of Keswick, from which point there is a noble view of the
               Vale of Legberthwaite, with Blencathra (commonly called Saddle-back) in front. Having
               previously enquired, at the Inn near Wythburn Chapel, the best way from this mile-stone
               to the bridge that divides the Lake, he must cross it, and proceed with the Lake on
               the right, to the hamlet a little beyond its termination, and rejoin the main road
               upon Shoulthwaite Moss, about four miles from Keswick; or, if on foot, the Tourist
               may <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e770">[Page]</span> follow the stream that issues from Thirlmere down the romantic Vale of St. John's,
               and so (enquiring the way at some cottage) to Keswick, by a circuit of little more
               than a mile. A more interesting tract of country is scarcely any where to be seen,
               than the road between Ambleside and Keswick, with the deviations that have been pointed
               out. Helvellyn may be conveniently ascended from the Inn at Wythburn. <br/><br/><span class="center"><a class="colorbox-node" href="n048.html">THE VALE OF KESWICK</a>.</span></p>
            <p>This Vale stretches, without winding, nearly North and South, from the head of Derwent
               Water to the foot of Bassenthwaite Lake. It communicates with Borrowdale on the South;
               with the river Greta, and Thirlmere, on the East, with which the Traveller has become
               acquainted on his way from Ambleside; and with the Vale of Newlands on the West—which
               last Vale he may pass through, in going to, or returning from, Buttermere. The best
               views of Keswick Lake are from Crow Park; Frier's Crag; the Stable-field, close by;
               the Vicarage, and from various points in taking the circuit of the Lake. More distant
               views, and perhaps full as interesting, are from the side of Latrigg, from Ormathwaite,
               and Applethwaite; and thence along the road at the foot of Skiddaw towards Bassenthwaite,
               for about a quarter of a mile. There are fine bird's eye views from the Castle-hill;
               from <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e781">[Page]</span> Ashness, on the road to Watenlath, and by following the Watenlath stream downwards
               to the <a class="colorbox-node" href="n049.html">Cataract of Lodore</a>. This Lake also, if the weather be fine, ought to be circumnavigated. There are good
               views along the western side of Bassenthwaite Lake, and from Armathwaite at its foot;
               but the eastern side from the high road has little to recommend it. The Traveller
               from Carlisle, approaching by way of Ireby, has, from the old road on the top of Bassenthwaite-hawse,
               much the most striking view of the Plain and Lake of Bassenthwaite, flanked by Skiddaw,
               and terminated by Wallowcrag on the south-east of Derwent Lake; the same point commands
               an extensive view of Solway Frith and the Scotch Mountains. They who take the circuit
               of Derwent Lake, may at the same time include BORROWDALE, going as far as Bowder-stone,
               or Rosthwaite. Borrowdale is also conveniently seen on the way to Wastdale over Styhead;
               or, to Buttermere, by Seatoller and Honister Crag; or, going over the Stake, through
               Langdale, to Ambleside. Buttermere may be visited by a shorter way through Newlands,
               but though the descent upon the Vale of Buttermere, by this approach, is very striking,
               as it also is to one entering by the head of the Vale, under Honister Crag, yet, after
               all, the best entrance from Keswick is from the lower part of the Vale, having gone
               over Whinlater to Scale Hill, where there is a roomy Inn, with very good accommodation.
               The Mountains of the Vale of <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e786">[Page]</span> <br/><br/><span class="center">BUTTERMERE AND CRUMMOCK</span><br/> Are nowhere so impressive as from the bosom of Crummock Water. Scale-force, near
               it, is a fine chasm, with a lofty, though but slender, fall of water.
            </p>
            <p>From Scale Hill a pleasant walk may be taken to an eminence in <a class="colorbox-node" href="n050.html">Mr. Marshall's woods</a>, and another by crossing the bridge at the foot of the hill, upon which the Inn stands,
               and turning to the right, after the opposite hill has been ascended a little way,
               then follow the road for half a mile or so that leads towards Lorton, looking back
               upon Crummock Water, &amp;, between the openings of the fences. Turn back and make your
               way to <br/><br/><span class="center">LOWESWATER.</span></p>
            <p>But this small Lake is only approached to advantage from the other end; therefore
               any Traveller going by this road to Wasdale, must look back upon it. This road to
               Wastdale, after passing the village of Lamplugh Cross, presents suddenly a fine view
               of the Lake of Ennerdale, with its Mountains; and, six or seven miles beyond, leads
               down upon <a class="colorbox-node" href="n051.html">Calder Abbey</a>. Little of this ruin is left, but that little is well worthy of notice. At Calder
               Bridge are two comfortable Inns, and, a few miles beyond, accommodations may be had
               at the Strands, at the foot of Wastdale. Into <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e809">[Page]</span> <br/><br/><span class="center">WASTDALE</span><br/> Are three horse-roads, viz. over the Stye from Borrowdale; a short cut from Eskdale
               by Burnmore Tarn, which road descends upon the head of the Lake; and the principal
               entrance from the open country by the Strands at its foot. This last is much the best
               approach. Wastdale is well worth the notice of the Traveller who is not afraid of
               fatigue; no part of the country is more distinguished by sublimity. Wastwater may
               also be visited from Ambleside; by going up Langdale, over Hardknot and Wrynose —down
               Eskdale and by Irton Hall to the Strands; but this road can only be taken on foot,
               or on horseback, or in a cart.
            </p>
            <p>We will conclude with <br/><br/><span class="center"><a class="colorbox-node" href="n052.html">ULLSWATER</a>,</span><br/> As being, perhaps, upon the whole, the happiest combination of beauty and grandeur,
               which any of the Lakes affords. It lies not more than ten miles from Ambleside, and
               the <a class="colorbox-node" href="n053.html">Pass of Kirkstone</a> and the descent from it are very impressive; but, notwithstanding, this Vale, like
               the others, loses much of its effect by being entered from the head: so that it is
               better to go from Keswick through Matterdale, and descend upon Gowbarrow Park; you
               are thus brought at once upon a magnifi<span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e831">[Page]</span>cent view of the two higher reaches of the Lake. <a class="colorbox-node" href="n054.html">Ara-force</a> thunders down the Ghyll on the left, at a small distance from the road. If Ullswater
               be approached from Penrith, a mile and a half brings you to the winding vale of Eamont,
               and the prospects increase in interest till you reach Patterdale; but the first four
               miles along Ullswater by this road are comparatively tame; and in order to see the
               lower part of the Lake to advantage, it is necessary to go round by Pooley Bridge,
               and to ride at least three miles along the Westmorland side of the water, towards
               Martindale. The views, especially if you ascend from the road into the fields, are
               magnificent; yet this is only mentioned that the transient Visitant may know what
               exists; for it would be inconvenient to go in search of them. They who take this course
               of three or four miles <em>on foot</em>, should have a boat in readiness at the end of the walk, to carry them across to
               the Cumberland side of the Lake, near Old Church, thence to pursue the road upwards
               to Patterdale. The Church-yard <a class="colorbox-node" href="n055.html">Yew-tree still survives at Old Church</a>, but there are no remains of a Place of Worship, a New Chapel having been erected
               in a more central situation, which Chapel was consecrated by the then Bishop of Carlisle,
               when on his way to crown Queen Elizabeth, he being the only Prelate who would undertake
               the office. It may be here mentioned that Bassenthwaite Chapel yet stands in a bay
               as sequestered as the Site of Old Church; <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e843">[Page]</span> such situations having been chosen in disturbed times to elude marauders.
            </p>
            <p>The Trunk, or Body of the Vale of Ullswater need not be further noticed, as its beauties
               show themselves: but the curious Traveller may wish to know something of its tributary
               Streams. 
            </p>
            <p>At Dalemain, about three miles from Penrith, a Stream is crossed called the Dacre,
               or Dacor, which name it bore as early as the time of the <a class="colorbox-node" href="n057.html">Venerable Bede</a>. This stream does not enter the Lake, but joins the Eamont a mile below. It rises
               in the moorish Country about Penruddock, flows down a soft sequestered Valley, passing
               by the ancient mansions of <a class="colorbox-node" href="n058.html">Hutton John</a> and <a class="colorbox-node" href="n059.html">Dacre Castle</a>. The former is pleasantly situated, though of a character somewhat gloomy and monastic,
               and from some of the fields near Dalemain, Dacre Castle, backed by the jagged summit
               of Saddleback, with the Valley and Stream in front, forms a grand picture. There is
               no other stream that conducts to any glen or valley worthy of being mentioned, till
               we reach that which leads up to Ara-force, and thence into Matterdale, before spoken
               of. Matterdale, though a wild and interesting spot, has no peculiar features that
               would make it worth the Stranger's while to go in search of them; but, in <a class="colorbox-node" href="n060.html">Gowbarrow Park</a>, the lover of Nature might linger for hours. Here is a powerful Brook, which dashes
               among rocks through a deep glen, hung on every side with a rich and happy <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e861">[Page]</span> intermixture of native wood; here are beds of luxuriant fern, aged hawthorns, and
               hollies decked with honeysuckles; and fallow-deer glancing and bounding over the lawns
               and through the thickets. These are the attractions of the retired views, or constitute
               a foreground for ever-varying pictures of the majestic Lake, forced to take a winding
               course by bold promontories, and environed by mountains of sublime form, towering
               above each other. At the outlet of Gowbarrow Park, we reach a third stream, which
               flows through a little recess called Glencoin, where lurks a single house, yet visible
               from the road. Let the Artist or leisurely Traveller turn aside to it, for the buildings
               and objects around them are romantic and picturesque. Having passed under the steeps
               of Styebarrow Crag, and the remains of its native woods, at Glenridding Bridge, a
               fourth Stream is crossed.
            </p>
            <p>The opening on the side of Ullswater Vale, down which this Stream flows, is adorned
               with fertile fields, cottages, and natural groves, that agreeably unite with the transverse
               views of the Lake; and the Stream, if followed up after the enclosures are left behind,
               will lead along bold water-breaks and waterfalls to a silent Tarn in the recesses
               of Helvellyn. This desolate spot was formerly haunted by eagles, that built in the
               precipice which forms its western barrier. These birds used to wheel and hover round
               the head of the solitary angler. It also derives a melancholy interest <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e865">[Page]</span> from the <a class="colorbox-node" href="n061.html">fate of a young man, a stranger</a>, who perished some years ago, by falling down the rocks in his attempt to cross over
               to Grasmere. His remains were discovered by means of a faithful dog that had lingered
               here for the space of three months, self-supported, and probably retaining to the
               last an attachment to the skeleton of its master. But to return to the road in the
               main Vale of Ullswater.—At the head of the Lake (being now in Patterdale) we cross
               a fifth Stream, Grisdale Beck: this would conduct through a woody steep, where may
               be seen some unusually large ancient hollies, up to the level area of the Valley of
               Grisdale; hence there is a path for foot-travellers, and along which a horse may be
               led, to Grasmere. A sublime combination of mountain forms appears in front while ascending
               the bed of this valley, and the impression increases till the path leads almost immediately
               under the projecting masses of Helvellyn. Having retraced the banks of the Stream
               to Patterdale, and pursued the road up the main Dale, the next considerable stream
               would, if ascended in the same manner, conduct to Deep-dale, the character of which
               Valley may be conjectured from its name. It is terminated by a cove, a craggy and
               gloomy abyss, with precipitous sides; a faithful receptacle of the snows that are
               driven into it, by the west wind, from the summit of Fairfield. Lastly, having gone
               along the western side of Brotherswater and passed Hartsop Hall, a Stream soon after
               is<span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e871">[Page]</span>sues from a cove richly decorated with native wood. This spot is, I believe, never
               explored by Travellers; but, from these sylvan and rocky recesses, whoever looks back
               on the gleaming surface of Brotherswater, or forward to the precipitous sides and
               lofty ridges of Dove Crag, &amp;, will be equally pleased with the beauty, the grandeur,
               and the wildness of the scenery.
            </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Seven Glens or Vallies have been noticed, which branch off from the Cumberland side
                  of the Vale. The opposite side has only two Streams of any importance, one of which
                  would lead up from the point where it crosses the Kirkstone-road, near the foot of
                  Brotherswater, to the decaying hamlet of Hartsop, remarkable for its cottage architecture,
                  and thence to Hayswater, much frequented by anglers. The other, coming down Martindale,
                  enters Ullswater at Sandwyke, opposite to Gowbarrow Park. No persons but such as come
                  to Patterdale, merely to pass through it, should fail to walk as far as Blowick, the
                  only enclosed land which on this side borders the higher part of the Lake. The axe
                  has here indiscriminately levelled a rich wood of birches and oaks, that divided this
                  favoured spot into a hundred pictures. It has yet its land-locked bays, and rocky
                  promontories; but those beautiful woods are gone, which <em>perfected</em> its seclusion; and scenes, that might formerly have been compared to an inexhaustible
                  volume, are now spread before the eye in a sin<span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e880">[Page]</span>gle sheet—magnificent indeed, but seemingly perused in a moment! From Blowick a narrow
                  track conducts along the craggy side of Place-fell, richly adorned with juniper, and
                  sprinkled over with birches, to the village of Sandwyke, a few straggling houses,
                  that with the small estates attached to them, occupy an opening opposite to Lyulph's
                  Tower and Gowbarrow Park. In Martindale,

                  </div> the road loses sight of the Lake, and leads over a steep hill, bringing you again
                  into view of Ullswater. Its lowest reach, four miles in length, is before you; and
                  the view terminated by the long ridge of Cross Fell in the distance. Immediately under
                  the eye is a deep-indented bay, with a plot of fertile land, traversed by a small
                  brook, and rendered cheerful by two or three substantial houses of a more ornamented
                  and showy appearance than is usual in those wild spots.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>From Pooley Bridge, at the foot of the Lake, Haweswater may be conveniently visited.
               Haweswater is a lesser Ullswater, with this advantage, that it remains undefiled by
               the intrusion of bad taste. 
            </p>
            <p><a class="colorbox-node" href="n062.html">Lowther Castle</a> is about four miles from Pooley Bridge, and, if during this Tour the Stranger has
               complained, as he will have had reason to do, of a want of majestic trees, he may
               be abundantly recompensed for his loss in the far-spreading woods which surround <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e892">[Page]</span> that mansion. Visitants, for the most part, see little of the beauty of these magnificent
               grounds, being content with the view from the Terrace; but the whole course of the
               Lowther, from Askham to the bridge under <a class="colorbox-node" href="n063.html">Brougham Hall</a>, presents almost at every step some new feature of river, woodland, and rocky landscape.
               A portion of this tract has, from its beauty, acquired the name of the Elysian Fields;
               —but the course of the stream can only be followed by the pedestrian.

            <p>NOTE.—<em>Vide</em> p. xii.—About 200 yards beyond the last house of the Keswick side of Rydal village
               the road is cut through a low wooded rock, called Thrang Crag. The top of it, which
               is only a few steps on the south side, affords the best view of the Vale which is
               to be had by a Traveller who confines himself to the public road. <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e903">[Page]</span></p>

               <p><a class="colorbox-node" href="n064.html">At Lucerne, in Switzerland, is shewn a Model of the Alpine country</a> which encompasses the Lake of the four Cantons. The Spectator ascends a little platform,
                  and sees mountains, lakes, glaciers, rivers, woods, waterfalls, and vallies, with
                  their cottages, and every other object contained in them, lying at his feet; all things
                  being represented in their appropriate colours. It may be easily conceived that this
                  exhibition affords an exquisite delight to the imagination, tempting it to wander
                  at will from valley to valley, from mountain to mountain, through the deepest recesses
                  of the Alps. But it supplies also a more substantial pleasure: for the sublime and
                  beautiful region, with all its hidden treasures, and their bearings and relations
                  to each other, is thereby comprehended and understood at once. <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e921">[Page]</span></p>
               <p>Something of this kind, without touching upon minute details and individualities which
                  would only confuse and embarrass, will here be attempted, in respect to the Lakes
                  in the north of England, and the vales and mountains enclosing and surrounding them.
                  The delineation, if tolerably executed, will, in some instances, communicate to the
                  traveller, who has already seen the objects, new information; and will assist in giving
                  to his recollections a more orderly arrangement than his own opportunities of observing
                  may have permitted him to make; while it will be still more useful to the future traveller,
                  by directing his attention at once to distinctions in things which, without such previous
                  aid, a length of time only could enable him to discover. It is hoped, also, that this
                  Essay may become generally serviceable, by leading to habits of more exact and considerate
                  observation than, as far as the writer knows, have hitherto been applied to local
                  scenery.

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>To begin, then, with the main outlines of the country;—I know not how to give the
                     reader a distinct image of these more readily, than by requesting him to place himself
                     with me, in imagination, upon some given point; let it be the top of either of the
                     mountains, <a class="colorbox-node" href="n065.html">Great Gavel, or Scawfell</a>; or, rather, let us suppose our station to be a cloud hanging midway between those
                     two mountains, at not more than half a mile's distance from the summit of each, and
                     not many yards above <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e929">[Page]</span> their highest elevation; we shall then see stretched at our feet a number of vallies,
                     not fewer than eight, diverging from the point, on which we are supposed to stand, <a class="colorbox-node" href="n066.html">like spokes from the nave of a wheel</a>. First, we note, lying to the south-east, the vale of Langdale,
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">

                              for a valley.</span></div>
                     </div>, which will conduct the eye to the long lake of <a class="colorbox-node" href="n067.html">Winandermere</a>, stretched nearly to the sea; or rather to the sands of the vast bay of Morcamb,
                     serving here for the rim of this imaginary wheel;—let us trace it in a direction from
                     the south-east towards the south, and we shall next fix our eyes upon the vale of
                     Coniston, running up likewise from the sea, but not (as all the other vallies do)
                     to the nave of the wheel, and therefore it may be not inaptly represented as a broken
                     spoke sticking in the rim. Looking forth again, with an inclination towards the west,
                     we see immediately at our feet the vale of Duddon, in which is no lake, but a copious
                     stream winding among fields, rocks, and mountains, and terminating its course in the
                     sands of Duddon. The fourth vale, next to be observed, viz. that of the Esk, is of
                     the same general character as the last, yet beautifully discriminated from it by peculiar
                     features. Its stream passes under the woody steep upon which stands Muncaster Castle,
                     the ancient seat of the Penningtons, <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e944">[Page]</span> and after forming a short and narrow [ae]stuary enters the sea below the small town
                     of Ravenglass. Next, almost due west, look down into, and along the deep valley of
                     Wastdale, with its little chapel and half a dozen neat dwellings scattered upon a
                     plain of meadow and corn-ground intersected with stone walls apparently innumerable,
                     like a large piece of lawless patch-work, or an array of mathematical figures, such
                     as in the ancient schools of geometry might have been sportively and fantastically
                     traced out upon sand. Beyond this little fertile plain lies, within a bed of steep
                     mountains, the long, narrow, stern, and desolate lake of Wastdale; and, beyond this,
                     a dusky tract of level ground conducts the eye to the Irish Sea. The stream that issues
                     from Wast-water is named the Irt, and falls into the estuary of the river Esk. Next
                     comes in view Ennerdale, with its lake of bold and somewhat savage shores. Its stream,
                     the Ehen or Enna, flowing through a soft and fertile country, passes the town of Egremont,
                     and the ruins of the castle,—then, seeming, like the other rivers, to break through
                     the barrier of sand thrown up by the winds on this tempestuous coast, enters the Irish
                     Sea. The vale of Buttermere, with the lake and village of that name, and Crummock-water,
                     beyond, next present themselves. We will follow the main stream, the Coker, through
                     the fertile and beautiful vale of Lorton, till it is lost in the Derwent, below the
                     noble ruins of Cocker<span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e947">[Page]</span>mouth Castle. Lastly, Borrowdale, of which the vale of Keswick is only a continuation,
                     stretching due north, brings us to a point nearly opposite to the vale of Winandermere
                     with which we began. From this it will appear, that the image of a wheel, thus far
                     exact, is little more than one half complete; but the deficiency on the eastern side
                     may be supplied by the vales of Wytheburn, Ulswater, Hawswater, and the vale of Grasmere
                     and Rydal; none of these, however, run up to the central point between Great Gavel
                     and Scawfell. From this, hitherto our central point, take a flight of not more than
                     four or five miles eastward to the ridge of Helvellyn, and you will look down upon
                     Wytheburn and St. John's Vale, which are a branch of the vale of Keswick; upon Ulswater,
                     stretching due east:—and not far beyond to the south-east (though from this point
                     not visible) lie the vale and lake of Hawswater; and lastly, the vale of Grasmere,
                     Rydal, and Ambleside, brings you back to Winandermere, thus completing, though on
                     the eastern side in a somewhat irregular manner, the representative figure of the
                     wheel.
                  </p>
               </div>
               <p>Such, concisely given, is the general topographical view of the country of the Lakes
                  in the north of England; and it may be observed, that, from the circumference to the
                  centre, that is, from the sea or plain country to the mountain stations specified,
                  there is—in the several ridges that enclose these vales, and divide them from each
                  other, I mean in the <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e951">[Page]</span> forms and surfaces, first of the swelling grounds, next of the hills and rocks, and
                  lastly of the mountains—an ascent of almost regular gradation, from elegance and richness,
                  to their highest point of grandeur and sublimity. It follows therefore from this,
                  first, that these rocks, hills, and mountains, must present themselves to view in
                  stages rising above each other, the mountains clustering together towards the central
                  point; and next, that an observer familiar with the several vales, must, from their
                  various position in relation to the sun, have had before his eyes every possible embellishment
                  of beauty, dignity, and splendour, which light and shadow can bestow upon objects
                  so diversified. For example, in the vale of Winandermere, if the spectator looks for
                  gentle and lovely scenes, his eye is turned towards the south; if for the grand, towards
                  the north: in the vale of Keswick, which (as hath been said) lies almost due north
                  of this, it is directly the reverse. Hence, when the sun is setting in summer far
                  to the north-west, it is seen, by the spectator from the shores or breast of Winandermere,
                  resting among the summits of the loftiest mountains, some of which will perhaps be
                  half or wholly hidden by clouds, or by the blaze of light which the orb diffuses around
                  it; and the surface of the lake will reflect before the eye correspondent colours
                  through every variety of beauty, and through all degrees of splendour. In the vale
                  of Keswick, at the same period, the sun sets <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e953">[Page]</span> over the humbler regions of the landscape, and showers down upon <em>them</em> the radiance which at once veils and glorifies,—sending forth, meanwhile, broad streams
                  of rosy, crimson, purple, or golden light, towards the grand mountains in the south
                  and south-east, which, thus illuminated, with all their projections and cavities,
                  and with an intermixture of solemn shadows, are seen distinctly through a cool and
                  clear atmosphere. Of course, there is as marked a difference between the <em>noontide</em> appearance of these two opposite vales. The bedimming haze that overspreads the south,
                  and the clear atmosphere and determined shadows of the clouds in the north, at the
                  same time of the day, are each seen in these several vales, with a contrast as striking.
                  The reader will easily conceive in what degree the intermediate vales partake of a
                  kindred variety.
               </p>
               <p>I do not indeed know any tract of country in which, within so narrow a compass, may
                  be found an equal variety in the influences of light and shadow upon the sublime or
                  beautiful features of landscape; and it is owing to the combined circumstances to
                  which the reader's attention has been directed. From a point between Great Gavel and
                  Scawfell, a shepherd would not require more than an hour to descend into any one of
                  eight of the principal vales by which he would be surrounded; and all the others lie
                  (with the exception of Hawswater) at but a small distance. Yet, though clustered together,
                  every valley has its distinct <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e963">[Page]</span> and separate character: in some instances, as if they had been formed in studied
                  contrast to each other, and in others with the united pleasing differences and resemblances
                  of a sisterly rivalship. This concentration of interest gives to the country a decided
                  superiority over the most attractive districts of Scotland and Wales, especially for
                  the pedestrian traveller. In Scotland and Wales are found, undoubtedly, individual
                  scenes, which, in their several kinds, cannot be excelled. But, in Scotland, particularly,
                  what long tracts of desolate country intervene! so that the traveller, when he reaches
                  a spot deservedly of great celebrity, would find it difficult to determine how much
                  of his pleasure is owing to excellence inherent in the landscape itself; and how much
                  to an instantaneous recovery from an oppression left upon his spirits by the barrenness
                  and desolation through which he has passed.
               </p>
               <p>But to proceed with our survey;—and, first, of the MOUNTAINS. Their <em>forms</em> are endlessly diversified, sweeping easily or boldly in simple majesty, abrupt and
                  precipitous, or soft and elegant. In magnitude and grandeur they are individually
                  inferior to the most celebrated of those in some other parts of this island; but,
                  in the combinations which they make, towering above each other, or lifting themselves
                  in ridges like the waves of a tumultuous sea, and in the beauty and variety of their
                  surfaces and colours, they are surpassed by none.
               </p>
               <p>The general <em>surface</em> of the mountains is <a class="colorbox-node" href="n068.html">turf, <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e977">[Page]</span> rendered rich and green by the moisture of the climate. Sometimes the turf, as in
                     the neighbourhood of Newlands, is little broken</a>, the whole covering being soft and downy pasturage. In other places rocks predominate;
                  the soil is laid bare by torrents and burstings of water from the sides of the mountains
                  in heavy rains; and not unfrequently their perpendicular sides are seamed by ravines
                  (formed also by rains and torrents) which, meeting in angular points, entrench and
                  scar the surface with numerous figures like the letters W. and Y.
               </p>
               <p>In the ridge that divides Eskdale from Wasdale, granite is found; but the MOUNTAINS
                  are for the most part composed of the stone by mineralogists termed schist, which,
                  as you approach the plain country, gives place to limestone and free-stone; but schist
                  being the substance of the mountains, the predominant <em>color</em> of their <em>rocky</em> parts is bluish, or hoary grey—the general tint of the lichens with which the bare
                  stone is encrusted. With this blue or grey colour is frequently intermixed a red tinge,
                  proceeding from the iron that interveins the stone, and impregnates the soil. The
                  iron is the principle of decomposition in these rocks; and hence, when they become
                  pulverized, the elementary particles crumbling down, overspread in many places the
                  steep and almost precipitous sides of the mountains with an intermixture of colours,
                  <a class="colorbox-node" href="n069.html">like the compound hues of a dove's neck</a>. When in the heat of advancing summer, the fresh green <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e991">[Page]</span> tint of the herbage has somewhat faded, it is again revived by the appearance of
                  the fern profusely spread over the same ground: and, upon this plant, more than upon
                  any thing else, do the changes which the seasons make in the <a class="colorbox-node" href="n070.html">colouring of the mountains depend. About the first week in October</a>, the rich green, which prevailed through the whole summer, is usually passed away.
                  The brilliant and various colours of the fern are then in harmony with the autumnal
                  woods; bright yellow or lemon colour, at the base of the mountains, melting gradually,
                  through orange, to a dark russet brown towards the summits, where the plant, being
                  more exposed to the weather, is in a more advanced state of decay. Neither heath nor
                  furze are <em>generally</em> found upon the <em>sides</em> of these mountains, though in many places they are adorned by those plants, so beautiful
                  when in flower. We may add, that the mountains are of height sufficient to have the
                  surface towards the summit softened by distance, and to imbibe the finest aerial hues.
                  In common also with other mountains, their apparent forms and colours are perpetually
                  changed by the clouds and vapours which float round them: the effect indeed of mist
                  or haze, in a country of this character, is like that of magic. I have seen six or
                  seven ridges rising above each other, all created in a moment by the vapours upon
                  the side of a mountain, which, in its ordinary appearance, shewed not a projecting
                  point to furnish even a hint for such an operation. <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1003">[Page]</span></p>
               <p>I will take this opportunity of observing, that they who have studied the appearances
                  of nature feel that the superiority, in point of visual interest, of mountainous over
                  other countries— is more strikingly displayed in winter than in summer. This, as must
                  be obvious, is partly owing to the <em>forms</em> of the mountains, which, of course, are not affected by the seasons; but also, in
                  no small degree, to the greater variety that exists in their <a class="colorbox-node" href="n071.html">winter than their summer <em>colouring</em></a>. This variety is such, and so harmoniously preserved, that it leaves little cause
                  of regret when the splendour of autumn is passed away. The oak-coppices, upon the
                  sides of the mountains, retain russet leaves; the birch stands conspicuous with its
                  silver stem and puce-coloured twigs; the hollies, with green leaves and scarlet berries,
                  have come forth to view from among the deciduous trees, whose summer foliage had concealed
                  them: the ivy is now plentifully apparent upon the stems and boughs of the trees,
                  and upon the steep rocks. In place of the deep summer-green of the herbage and fern,
                  many rich colours play into each other over the surface of the mountains; turf (the
                  tints of which are interchangeably tawny-green, olive, and brown,) beds of withered
                  fern, and grey rocks, being harmoniously blended together. The mosses and lichens
                  are never so fresh and flourishing as in winter, if it be not a season of frost; and
                  their minute beauties prodigally adorn the foreground. Wherever we turn, we find these
                  <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1014">[Page]</span> productions of nature, to which winter is rather favourable than unkindly, scattered
                  over the walls, banks of earth, rocks, and stones, and upon the trunks of trees, with
                  the intermixture of several species of small fern, now green and fresh; and, to the
                  observing passenger, their forms and colours are a source of inexhaustable admiration.
                  Add to this the hoar-frost and snow, with all the varieties they create, and which
                  volumes would not be sufficient to describe. I will content myself with one instance
                  of the colouring produced by snow, which may not be uninteresting to painters. It
                  is <a class="colorbox-node" href="n072.html">extracted from the memorandum-book of a friend</a>; and for its accuracy I can speak, having been an eye-witness of the appearance.
                  "I observed," says he, "the beautiful effect of the drifted snow upon the mountains,
                  and the perfect <em>tone</em> of colour. From the top of the mountains downwards a rich olive was produced by the
                  powdery snow and the grass, which olive was warmed with a little brown, and in this
                  way harmoniously combined, by insensible gradations, with the white. The drifting
                  took away the monotony of snow; and the whole vale of Grasmere, seen from the terrace
                  walk in Easedale, was as varied, perhaps more so, than even in the pomp of autumn.
                  In the distance was Loughrigg-Fell, the basin-wall of the lake: this, from the summit
                  downward, was a rich orange-olive; then the lake of a bright olive-green, nearly the
                  same tint as the snow-powdered mountain <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1023">[Page]</span> tops and high slopes in Easedale; and lastly, the church, with its firs, forming
                  the centre of the view. Next to the church came nine distinguishable hills, six of
                  them with woody sides turned towards us, all of them oak-copses with their bright
                  red leaves and snow-powdered twigs; these hills—so variously situated in relation
                  to each other, and to the view in general, so variously powdered, some only enough
                  to give the herbage a rich brown tint, one intensely white and lighting up all the
                  others —were yet so placed, as in the most inobtrusive manner to harmonise by contrast
                  with a perfect naked, snowless bleak summit in the far distance."
               </p>
               <p>Having spoken of the forms, surface, and colour of the mountains, let us descend into
                  the VALES. Though these have been represented under the general image of the spokes
                  of a wheel, they are, for the most part, winding; the windings of many being abrupt
                  and intricate. And, it may be observed, that, in one circumstance, the general shape
                  of them all has been determined by that primitive conformation through which so many
                  became receptacles of lakes. For they are not formed, as are most of the celebrated
                  Welsh vallies, by an approximation of the sloping bases of the opposite mountains
                  towards each other, leaving little more between than a channel for the passage of
                  a hasty river; but the bottom of these vallies is mostly a spacious and gently declining
                  area, apparently level as the floor <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1028">[Page]</span> of a temple, or the surface of a lake, and broken in many cases, by rocks and hills,
                  which rise up like islands from the plain. In such of the vallies as make many windings,
                  these level areas open upon the traveller in succession, divided from each other sometimes
                  by a mutual approximation of the hills, leaving only passage for a river, sometimes
                  by correspondent windings, without such approximation; and sometimes by a bold advance,
                  of one mountain towards that which is opposite it. It may here be observed with propriety
                  that the several rocks and hills, which have been described as rising up like islands
                  from the level area of the vale, have regulated the choice of the inhabitants in the
                  situation of their dwellings. Where none of these are found, and the inclination of
                  the ground is not sufficiently rapid easily to carry off the waters, (as in the higher
                  part of Langdale, for instance,) the houses are not sprinkled over the middle of the
                  vales, but confined to their sides, being placed merely so far up the mountain as
                  to be protected from the floods. But where these rocks and hills have been scattered
                  over the plain of the vale, (as in Grasmere, Donnerdale, Eskdale, &amp;.) the beauty which
                  they give to the scene is much heightened by a single cottage, or cluster of cottages,
                  that will be almost always found under them, or upon their sides; dryness and shelter
                  having tempted the Dalesmen to fix their habitations there. <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1030">[Page]</span></p>
               <p>I shall now speak of the LAKES of this country. The form of the lake is most perfect
                  when, like Derwent-water, and some of the smaller lakes, it least resembles that of
                  a river; —I mean, when being looked at from any given point where the whole may be
                  seen at once, the width of it bears such proportion to the length, that, however the
                  outline may be diversified by far-receding bays, it never assumes the shape of a river,
                  and is contemplated with that placid and quiet feeling which belongs peculiarly to
                  the lake—as a body of still water under the influence of no current; reflecting therefore
                  the clouds, the light, and all the imagery of the sky and surrounding hills; expressing
                  also and making visible the changes of the atmosphere, and motions of the lightest
                  breeze, and subject to agitation only from the winds—
               </p>

               <p>It must be noticed, as a favourable characteristic of the lakes of this country, that,
                  though several of the largest, such as Winandermere, Ulswater, Haweswater, do, when
                  the whole length of them is commanded from an elevated point, lose somewhat of the
                  peculiar form of the lake, and assume the resemblance of a magnificent river; yet,
                  as their shape is winding, <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1051">[Page]</span> (particularly that of Ulswater and Hawswater) when the view of the whole is obstructed
                  by those barriers which determine the windings, and the spectator is confined to one
                  reach, the appropriate feeling is revived; and one lake may thus in succession present
                  to the eye the essential characteristic of many. But, though the forms of the large
                  lakes have this advantage, it is nevertheless favourable to the beauty of the country
                  that the largest of them are comparatively small; and that the same vale generally
                  furnishes a succession of lakes, instead of being filled with one. The vales in North
                  Wales, as hath been observed, are not formed for the reception of lakes; those of
                  Switzerland, Scotland, and this part of the North of England, <em>are</em> so formed; but, in Switzerland and Scotland, the proportion of diffused water is
                  often too great, as at the lake of Geneva for instance, and in most of the Scotch
                  lakes. No doubt it sounds magnificent and flatters the imagination, to hear at a distance
                  of expanses of water so many leagues in length and miles in width; and such ample
                  room may be delightful to the fresh-water sailor, scudding with a lively breeze amid
                  the rapidly-shifting scenery. But, who ever travelled along the banks of Loch-Lomond,
                  variegated as the lower part is by islands, without feeling that a speedier termination
                  of the long vista of blank water would be acceptable; and without wishing for an interposition
                  of green meadows, trees, and cottages, and a sparkling <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1056">[Page]</span> stream to run by his side? In fact, a notion, of grandeur, as connected with magnitude,
                  has seduced persons of taste into a general mistake upon this subject. It is much
                  more desirable, for the purposes of pleasure, that lakes should be numerous, and small
                  or middlesized, than large, not only for communication by walks and rides, but for
                  variety, and for recurrence of similar appearances. To illustrate this by one instance:—how
                  pleasing is it to have a ready and frequent opportunity of watching, at the outlet
                  of a lake, the stream pushing its way among the rocks in lively contrast with the
                  stillness from which it has escaped; and how amusing to compare its noisy and turbulent
                  motions with the gentle playfulness of the breezes, that may be starting up or wandering
                  here and there over the faintly-rippled surface of the broad water! I may add, as
                  a general remark, that, in lakes of great width, the shores cannot be distinctly seen
                  at the same time, and therefore contribute little to mutual illustration and ornament;
                  and, if the opposite shores are out of sight of each other, like those of the American
                  and Asiatic lakes, then unfortunately the traveller is reminded of a nobler object;
                  he has the blankness of a sea-prospect without the grandeur and accompanying sense
                  of power.
               </p>
               <p>As the comparatively small size of the lakes in the North of England is favourable
                  to the production of variegated landscape, their <em>boundary-line</em> also is for the most part gracefully <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1063">[Page]</span> or boldly indented. That uniformity which prevails in the primitive frame of the
                  lower grounds among all chains or clusters of mountains where large bodies of still
                  water are bedded, is broken by the <em>secondary</em> agents of nature, ever at work to supply the deficiences of the mould in which things
                  were originally cast. Using the word <em>deficiences</em>, I do not speak with reference to those stronger emotions which a region of mountains
                  is peculiarly fitted to excite. The bases of those huge barriers may run for a long
                  space in straight lines, and these parallel to each other; the opposite sides of a
                  profound vale may ascend as exact counterparts, or in mutual reflection, like the
                  billows of a troubled sea; and the impression be, from its very simplicity, more awful
                  and sublime. Sublimity is the result of Nature's first great dealings with the superficies
                  of the earth; but the general tendency of her subsequent operations is towards the
                  production of beauty; by a multiplicity of symmetrical parts uniting in a consistent
                  whole. This is every where exemplified along the margins of these lakes. Masses of
                  rock, that have been precipitated from the heights into the area of waters, lie in
                  some places like stranded ships; or have acquired the compact structure of jutting
                  piers; or project in little peninsulas crested with native wood. The smallest rivulet—one
                  whose silent influx is scarcely noticeable in a season of dry weather—so faint is
                  the dimple made by it on the surface of the smooth lake—will <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1071">[Page]</span> be found to have been not useless in shaping, by its deposits of gravel and soil
                  in time of flood, a curve that would not otherwise have existed. But the more powerful
                  brooks, encroaching upon the level of the lake, have, in course of time, given birth
                  to ample promontories of sweeping outline that contrast boldly with the longitudinal
                  base of the steeps on the opposite shore; while their flat or gently sloping surfaces
                  never fail to introduce, into the midst of desolation and barrenness, the elements
                  of fertility, even where the habitations of men may not have been raised. These alluvial
                  promontories, however, threaten, in some places, to bisect the waters which they have
                  long adorned; and, in course of ages, they will cause some of the lakes to dwindle
                  into numerous and insignificant pools; which, in their turn, will finally be filled
                  up. But, checking these intrusive calculations, let us rather be content with appearances
                  as they are, and pursue in imagination the meandering shores, whether rugged steeps,
                  admitting of no cultivation, descend into the water; or gently-sloping lawns and woods,
                  or flat and fertile meadows stretch between the margin of the lake and the mountains.
                  Among minuter recommendations will be noticed, especially along bays exposed to the
                  setting-in of strong-winds, the curved rim of fine blue gravel, thrown up in course
                  of time by the waves, half of it perhaps gleaming from under the water, and the corresponding
                  half of a lighter <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1074">[Page]</span> hue; and in other parts bordering the lake, groves, if I may so call them, of reeds
                  and bulrushes; or plots of water-lilies lifting up their large target-shaped leaves
                  to the breeze, while the white flower is heaving upon the wave.
               </p>
               <p>To these may naturally be added the birds that enliven the waters. Wild-ducks in springtime
                  hatch their young in the islands, and upon reedy shores;— the sand-piper, flitting
                  along the stony margins, by its restless note attracts the eye to motions as restless:—upon
                  some jutting rock, or at the edge of a smooth meadow, the stately heron may be descried
                  with folded wings, that might seem to have caught their delicate hue from the blue
                  waters, by the side of which she watches for her sustenance. In winter, the lakes
                  are sometimes resorted to by wild swans; and in that season habitually by <a class="colorbox-node" href="n074.html">widgeons, goldings</a>, and other aquatic fowl of the smaller species. Let me be allowed the aid of verse
                  to describe the evolutions which these visitants sometimes perform, on a fine day
                  towards the close of winter.

                  <p>The ISLANDS, dispersed among these lakes, are neither so numerous nor so beautiful
                     as might be expected from the account that has been given of the manner in which the
                     level areas of the vales are so frequently diversified by rocks, hills, and hillocks,
                     scattered over them; nor are they ornamented (as are several of the lakes in Scotland
                     and Ireland) by the remains of castles or other places of defence; nor with the still
                     more interesting ruins of religious edifices. Every one must regret that scarcely
                     a vestige is left of the <a class="colorbox-node" href="n076.html">Oratory, consecrated to the Virgin, which stood upon Chapel-Holm in Windermere, and

                     they are fed, and which circulate through them like veins, they are truly living lakes, <em>"<a class="colorbox-node" href="n081.html">vivi lacus</a>;"</em> and are thus discriminated from the stagnant and sullen pools frequent among mountains
                     that have been formed by volcanoes, and from the shallow meres found in flat and fenny
                     countries. The water is also of crystalline purity; so that, if it were not for the
                     reflections of the incumbent mountains by which it is darkened, a delusion might be
                     felt, by a person resting quietly in a boat on the bosom of Winandermere or Derwent-water,
                     similar to that which <a class="colorbox-node" href="n082.html">Carver so beautifully describes</a> when he was floating alone in the middle of lake Erie or Ontario, and could almost

                     that the air and water were one.

               <p>Having spoken of Lakes I must not omit to mention, as a kindred feature of this country,
                  those bodies of still water called TARNS. In the economy of nature these are useful,
                  as auxiliars to Lakes; for if the whole quantity of water which falls upon the mountains
                  in time of storm were poured down upon the plains without intervention, in some quarters,
                  of such receptacles, the habitable grounds would be much more subject than they are
                  to inundation. But, as some of the collateral <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1185">[Page]</span> brooks spend their fury, finding a free course toward and also down the channel of
                  the main stream of the vale before those that have to pass through the higher tarns
                  and lakes have filled their several basins, a gradual distribution is effected; and
                  the waters thus reserved, instead of uniting, to spread ravage and deformity, with
                  those which meet with no such detention, contribute to support, for a length of time,
                  the vigour of many streams without a fresh fall of rain. Tarns are found in some of
                  the vales, and are numerous upon the mountains. A Tarn, in a <em>Vale</em>, implies, for the most part, that the bed of the vale is not happily formed; that
                  the water of the brooks can neither wholly escape, nor diffuse itself over a large
                  area. Accordingly, in such situations, Tarns are often surrounded by an unsightly
                  tract of boggy ground; but this is not always the case, and in the cultivated parts
                  of the country, when the shores of the Tarn are determined, it differs only from the
                  Lake in being smaller, and in belonging mostly to a smaller valley, or circular recess.
                  Of this class of miniature lakes, Loughrigg Tarn, near Grasmere, is the most beautiful
                  example. It has a margin of green firm meadows, of rocks, and rocky woods, a few reeds
                  here, a little company of water-lilies there, with beds of gravel or stone beyond;
                  a tiny stream issuing neither briskly nor sluggishly out of it; but its feeding rills,
                  from the shortness of their course, so small as to be scarcely visible. Five <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1190">[Page]</span> or six cottages are reflected in its peaceful bosom; rocky and barren steeps rise
                  up above the hanging enclosures; and the solemn pikes of Langdale overlook, from a
                  distance, the low cultivated ridge of land that forms the northern boundary of this
                  small, quiet, and fertile domain. The <em>mountain</em> Tarns can only be recommended to the notice of the inquisitive traveller who has
                  time to spare. They are difficult of access and naked; yet some of them are, in their
                  permanent forms, very grand; and there are accidents of things which would make the
                  meanest of them interesting. At all events, one of these pools is an acceptable sight
                  to the mountain wanderer; not merely as an incident that diversifies the prospect,
                  but as forming in his mind a centre or conspicuous point to which objects, otherwise
                  disconnected or insubordinated, may be referred. Some few have a varied outline, with
                  bold heath-clad promontories; and, as they mostly lie at the foot of a steep precipice,
                  the water where the sun is not shining upon it, appears black and sullen; and, round
                  the margin, huge stones and masses of rock are scattered; some defying conjecture
                  as to the means by which they came thither; and others obviously fallen from on high—the
                  contribution of ages! A not unpleasing sadness is induced by this perplexity, and
                  these images of decay; while the prospect of a body of pure water unattended with
                  groves and other cheerful rural images by which fresh water is usually <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1195">[Page]</span> accompanied, and unable to give furtherance to the meagre vegetation around it—excites
                  a sense of some repulsive power strongly put forth, and thus deepens the melancholy
                  natural to such scenes. Nor is the feeling of solitude often more forcibly or more
                  solemnly impressed than by the side of one of these mountain pools: though desolate
                  and forbidding, it seems a distinct place to repair to; yet where the visitants must
                  be rare, and there can be no disturbance. Water-fowl flock hither; and the lonely
                  Angler may here be seen; but the imagination, not content with this scanty allowance
                  of society, is tempted to attribute a voluntary power to every change which takes
                  place in such a spot, whether it be the breeze that wanders over the surface of the
                  water, or the splendid lights of evening resting upon it in the midst of awful precipices.

                     that body of water necessary to confer upon them much majesty. In fact, the most considerable,
                     while they continue in the mountain and lake-country, are rather large brooks than
                     rivers. The water is perfectly pellucid, through which in many places are seen, to
                     a great depth, their beds of rock, or of blue gravel, which give to the water itself
                     an exquisitely cerulean colour: this is particularly striking in the rivers Derwent
                     and Duddon, which may be compared, such and so various are their beauties, to any
                     two rivers of equal length of course in any country. The number of the torrents and
                     smaller brooks is infinite, with their water-falls and water-breaks; and they need
                     not here be described. I will only ob <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1223">[Page]</span>serve that, as many, even of the smallest rills, have either found, or made for themselves,

                     to withdraw from the eye, are the more endeared to the feelings.

                     expressed by the beauty and intricacy with which the fields and coppice-woods are
                     often intermingled: the plough of the first settlers having followed naturally the
                     veins of richer, dryer, or less stony soil; and thus it has shaped out an intermixture
                     of wood and lawn, with a grace and wildness which it would have been impossible for
                     the hand of studied art to produce. Other trees have been introduced within these
                     last fifty years, such as beeches, larches, limes, &amp;, and plantations of firs, seldom
                     with advantage, and often with great injury to the appearance of the country; but
                     the sycamore (which I believe was brought into this island from Germany, not more
                     than two hundred years ago) has long been the favourite of the cottagers; and, with
                     the fir, has been chosen to screen their dwellings: and is sometimes found in the
                     fields whither the winds or the waters may have carried its seeds.

               <p>The want most felt, however, is that of timber trees. There are a few <em>magnificent</em> ones to be found near any of the lakes; and unless greater care be taken, there will,
                  in a short time, scarcely be left an ancient oak that would repay the cost of felling.
                  The neighbourhood of Rydal, notwithstanding the havoc which has been made, is yet
                  nobly distinguished. In the woods of Lowther, also, is found an almost matchless store
                  of ancient trees, and the majesty and wildness of the native forest. <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1241">[Page]</span></p>
               <p>Among the smaller vegetable ornaments must be reckoned <a class="colorbox-node" href="n084.html">the bilberry</a>, a ground plant, never so beautiful as in early spring, when it is seen under bare
                  or budding trees, that imperfectly intercept the sun-shine, covering the rocky knolls
                  with a pure mantle of fresh verdure, more lively than the herbage of the open fields;—<a class="colorbox-node" href="n085.html">the broom</a> that spreads luxuriantly along rough pastures, and in the month of June interveins
                  the steep copses with its golden blossoms;—and the juniper, a rich evergreen, that
                  thrives in spite of cattle, upon the uninclosed parts of the mountains:—the Dutch
                  myrtle diffuses fragrance in moist places; and there is an endless variety of brilliant
                  flowers in the fields and meadows, which, if the agriculture of the country were more
                  carefully attended to, would disappear. Nor can I omit again to notice the lichens
                  and mosses: their profusion, beauty, and variety exceed those of any other country
                  I have seen.
               </p>
               <p>It may now be proper to say a few words respecting climate, and “<a class="colorbox-node" href="n086.html">skiey influences</a>,” in which this region, as far as the character of its landscapes is affected by
                  them, may, upon the whole, be considered fortunate. The country is, indeed, subject
                  to much bad weather, and it has been ascertained that <a class="colorbox-node" href="n087.html">twice as much rain falls here as in many parts of the island</a>; but the number of black drizzling days, that blot out the face of things, is by
                  no means <em>proportionally</em> great. Nor is a continuance of thick, flagging, damp air so common as in the West
                  <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1261">[Page]</span> of England and Ireland. The rain here comes down heartily, and is frequently succeeded
                  by clear, bright weather, when every brook is vocal, and every torrent sonorous; brooks
                  and torrents, which are never muddy, even in the heaviest floods, except, after a
                  drought, they happen to be defiled for a short time by waters that have swept along
                  dusty roads, or have broken out into ploughed fields. Days of unsettled weather, with
                  partial showers, are very frequent; but the showers, darkening, or brightening, as
                  they fly from hill to hill, are not less grateful to the eye than finely interwoven
                  passages of gay and sad music are touching to the ear. Vapours exhaling from the lakes
                  and meadows after sun-rise, in a hot season, or, in moist weather, brooding upon the
                  heights, or descending towards the valleys with inaudible motion, give a visionary
                  character to every thing around them; and are in themselves so beautiful, as to dispose
                  us to enter into the feelings of those simple nations (such as the Laplanders of this
                  day) by whom they are taken for guardian deities of the mountains; or to sympathize
                  with others who have fancied these delicate apparitions to be the spirits of their
                  departed ancestors. Akin to these are fleecy clouds resting upon the hill-tops; they
                  are not easily managed in picture, with their accompaniments of blue sky; but how
                  glorious are they in nature! how pregnant with imagination for the poet! and the height
                  of the Cumbrian mountains is sufficient to exhibit <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1263">[Page]</span> daily and hourly instances of those mysterious attachments. Such clouds, cleaving
                  to their stations, or lifting up suddenly their glittering heads from behind rocky
                  barriers, or hurrying out of sight with speed of the sharpest edge—will often tempt
                  an inhabitant to congratulate himself on belonging to a country of mists and clouds
                  and storms, and make him think of the blank sky of Egypt, and of the cerulean vacancy
                  of Italy, as an unanimated and even a sad spectacle. The atmosphere, however, as in
                  every country subject to much rain, is frequently unfavourable to landscape, especially
                  when keen winds succeed the rain which are apt to produce coldness, spottiness, and
                  an unmeaning or repulsive detail in the distance;—a sunless frost, under a canopy
                  of leaden and shapeless clouds, is, as far as it allows things to be seen, equally
                  disagreeable.
               </p>
               <p>It <a class="colorbox-node" href="n088.html">has been said that in human life there are moments worth ages</a>. In a more subdued tone of sympathy may we affirm, that in the climate of England
                  there are, for the lover of nature, days which are worth whole months, —I might say—even
                  years. One of these favoured days sometimes occurs in spring-time, when that soft
                  air is breathing over the blossoms and new-born verdure, which inspired <a class="colorbox-node" href="n089.html">Buchanan with his beautiful Ode to the first of May</a>; the air, which, in the luxuriance of his fancy, he likens to that of the golden
                  age, —to that which gives motion to the funereal cypresses on the banks of Lethe;—to
                  the air <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1273">[Page]</span> which is to salute beatified spirits when expiatory fires shall have consumed the
                  earth with all her habitations. But it is in autumn that days of such affecting influence
                  most frequently intervene;—the atmosphere seems refined, and the sky rendered more
                  crystalline, as the vivifying heat of the year abates; the lights and shadows are
                  more delicate; the colouring is richer and more finely harmonized; and, in this season
                  of stillness, the ear being unoccupied, or only gently excited, the sense of vision
                  becomes more susceptible of its appropriate enjoyments. A resident in a country like
                  this which we are treating of, will agree with me, that the presence of a lake is
                  indispensable to exhibit in perfection the beauty of one of these days; and he must
                  have experienced, while looking on the unruffled waters, that the imagination, by
                  their aid, is carried into recesses of feeling otherwise impenetrable. The reason
                  of this is, that the heavens are not only brought down into the bosom of the earth,
                  but that the earth is mainly looked at, and thought of, through the medium of a purer
                  element. The happiest times is when the equinoxial gales are departed; but their fury
                  may probably be called to mind by the sight of a few shattered boughs, whose leaves
                  do not differ in colour from the faded foliage of the stately oaks from which these
                  relics of the storm depend: all else speaks of tranquillity;—not a breath of air,
                  no restlessness of insects, and not a moving object perceptible— <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1275">[Page]</span> except the clouds gliding in the depths of the lake, or the traveller passing along,
                  an inverted image, whose motion seems governed by the quiet of a time, to which its
                  archetype, the living person, is, perhaps, insensible:— or it may happen, that the
                  figure of one of the larger birds, a raven or a heron, is crossing silently among
                  the reflected clouds, while the voice of the real bird, from the element aloft, gently
                  awakens in the spectator the recollection of appetites and instincts, pursuits and
                  occupations, that deform and agitate the world, —yet have no power to prevent Nature
                  from putting on an aspect capable of satisfying the most intense cravings for the
                  tranquil, the lovely, and the perfect, to which man, the noblest of her creatures,
                  is subject.
               </p>
               <p>Thus far, of climate, as influencing the feelings through its effect on the objects
                  of sense. We may add, that whatever has been said upon the advantages derived to these
                  scenes from a changeable atmosphere, would apply, perhaps still more forcibly, to
                  their appearance under the varied solemnities of night. <a class="colorbox-node" href="n090.html">Milton, it will be remembered, has given a <em>clouded</em> moon to Paradise itself</a>. In the night-season also, the narrowness of the vales, and comparative smallness
                  of the lakes, are especially adapted to bring surrounding objects home to the eye
                  and to the heart. The stars, taking their stations above the hill-tops, are contemplated
                  from a spot <a class="colorbox-node" href="n091.html">like the Abyssinian recess of Rasselas</a>, with much more touching inter<span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1289">[Page]</span>est than they are likely to excite when looked at from an open country with ordinary
                  undulations: and it must be obvious, that it is the <em>bays</em> only of large lakes that can present such contrasts of light and shadow as those
                  of smaller dimensions display from every quarter. A deep contracted valley, with diffused
                  waters, such a valley and plains level and wide as those of Chaldea, are the two extremes
                  in which the beauty of the heavens and their connexion with the earth are most sensibly
                  felt. Nor do the advantages I have been speaking of imply here an exclusion of the
                  aerial effects of distance. These are insured by the height of the mountains, and
                  are found, even in the narrowest vales, where they lengthen in perspective, or act
                  (if the expression may be used) as telescopes for the open country.

               <p>Hitherto I have chiefly spoken of the features by which nature has discriminated this
                  country from others. I will now describe, in general terms, in what manner it is indebted
                  to the hand of man. What I have to notice on this subject will emanate most easily
                  and perspicuously from a description of the ancient and present inhabitants, their
                  occupations, their condition of life, the distribution of landed property among them,
                  and the tenure by which it is holden. 
               </p>
               <p>The reader will suffer me here to recall to his mind the shapes of the vallies, and
                  their position with respect to each other, and the forms and substance of the intervening
                  mountains. He will people the vallies with lakes and rivers: the coves and sides of
                  the mountains with pools and torrents; and will bound half of the circle which we
                  have contemplated by the sands of the sea, or by the sea itself. He will conceive
                  that, from the point upon which he stood, he looks down upon this scene before the
                  country had been penetrated by any inhabitants:—to vary his sensations, and to break
                  in upon their stillness, he will form <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1361">[Page]</span> to himself an image of the tides visiting and re-visiting the friths, the main sea
                  dashing against the bolder shore, the rivers pursuing their course to be lost in the
                  mighty mass of waters. He may see or hear in fancy the winds sweeping over the lakes,
                  or piping with a loud voice among the mountain peaks; and, lastly, may think of the
                  primeval woods shedding and renewing their leaves with no human eye to notice, or
                  human heart to regret or welcome the change. "<a class="colorbox-node" href="n093.html">When the first settlers entered this region (says an animated writer)</a> they found it overspread with wood; forest trees, the fir, the oak, the ash, and
                  the birch had skirted the fells, tufted the hills, and shaded the vallies, through
                  centuries of silent solitude; the birds and beasts of prey reigned over the meeker
                  species; and the <em>bellum inter omnia</em> maintained the balance of nature in the empire of beasts."
               </p>
               <p>Such was the state and appearance of this region when the aboriginal colonists of
                  the Celtic tribes were first driven or drawn towards it, and became joint tenants
                  with the wolf, the boar, the wild bull, the red deer, and the leigh, a gigantic species
                  of deer which has been long extinct; while the inaccessible crags were occupied by
                  the falcon, the raven, and the eagle. The inner parts were too secluded, and of too
                  little value, to participate much of the benefit of Roman manners; and though these
                  conquerors encouraged the Britons to the improvement of their lands in the plain country
                  <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1371">[Page]</span> of Furness and Cumberland, they seem to have had little connexion with the mountains,
                  except for military purposes, or in subservience to the profit they drew from the
                  mines.

                  <p>When the Romans retired from Great Britain, it is well known that these mountainfastnesses
                     furnished a protection to some unsubdued Britons, long after the more accessible and
                     more fertile districts had been seized by the Saxon or Danish invader. A few, though
                     distinct, traces of Roman forts or camps, as at Ambleside, and upon Dunmallet, and
                     a few circles of rude stones attributed to the Druids,

                              Author, while making a trench in a level piece of ground, not far from the banks of
                              the Emont, but in no connection with that river, met with some stones which seemed
                              to him formally arranged; this excited his curiosity, and preceding, he uncovered

                     and, as the Saxons and Danes, who succeeded to the possession of the villages and
                     hamlets which had been established by the Britons, seem at first to have confined
                     themselves to the open country,—we may descend at once to times long posterior to
                     the conquest by the Normans, when their feudal polity was regularly established. We
                     may easily conceive that these narrow dales and mountain sides, <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1428">[Page]</span> choked up as they must have been with wood, lying out of the way of communication
                     with other parts of the Island, and upon the edge of a hostile kingdom, could have
                     little attraction for the high-born and powerful; especially as the more open parts
                     of the country furnished positions for castles and houses of defence, sufficient to
                     repel any of those sudden attacks, which, in the then rude state of military knowledge,
                     could be made upon them. Accordingly, the more retired regions (and to such I am now
                     confining myself) must have been neglected or shunned even by the persons whose baronial
                     or signioral rights extended over them, and left, doubtless, partly as a place of
                     refuge for outlaws and robbers, and partly granted out for the more settled habitation
                     of a few vassals following the employment of shepherds or woodlanders. Hence these
                     lakes and inner vallies are unadorned by any <a class="colorbox-node" href="n097.html">remains of ancient grandeur, castles, or monastic edifices</a>, which are only found upon the skirts of the country, as Furness Abbey, Calder Abbey,
                     the Priory of Lannercost, Gleaston Castle,—long ago a residence of the Flemings,—and
                     the numerous ancient castles of the Cliffords, the Lucys, and the Dacres. On the southern
                     side of these mountains, (especially in that part known by the name of Furness Fells,
                     which is more remote from the borders,) the state of society would necessarily be
                     more settled; though it also was fashioned, not a little, by its neighbourhood to
                     a hostile king<span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1434">[Page]</span>dom. We will, therefore, give a sketch of the economy of the Abbots in the distribution
                     of lands among their tenants, as similar plans were doubtless adopted by other Lords,
                     and as the consequences have affected the face of the country materially to the present
                     day, being, in fact, one of the principal causes which give it such a striking superiority,
                     in beauty and interest, over all other parts of the island.
                  </p>
               </div>
               <p>"When the Abbots of Furness," says<a class="colorbox-node" href="n098.html">an author before cited</a>, "enfranchised their villains, and raised them to the dignity of customary tenants,
                  the lands, which they had cultivated for their lord, were divided into whole tenements;
                  each of which, besides the customary annual rent, was charged with the obligation
                  of having in readiness a man completely armed for the king's service on the borders,
                  or elsewhere; each of these whole tenements was again subdivided into four equal parts;
                  each villain had one; and the party tenant contributed his share to the support of
                  the man of arms, and of other burdens. These divisions were not properly distinguished;
                  the land remained mixed; each tenant had a share through all the arable and meadow-land,
                  and common of pasture over all the wastes. These sub-tenements were judged sufficient
                  for the support of so many families; and no further division was permitted. These
                  divisions and and sub-divisions were convenient at the time for which they were calculated:
                  the land, so <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1441">[Page]</span> parcelled out, was of necessity more attended to, and the industry greater, when
                  more persons were to be supported by the produce of it. The frontier of the kingdom,
                  within which Furness was considered, was in a constant state of attack and defence;
                  more hands, therefore, were necessary to guard the coast, to repel an invasion from
                  Scotland, or make reprisals on the hostile neighbour. The dividing the lands in such
                  manner as has been shown, increased the number of inhabitants, and kept them at home
                  till called for: and, the land being mixed, and the several tenants united in equipping
                  the plough, the absence of the fourth man was no prejudice to the cultivation of his
                  land, which was committed to the care of three.
               </p>
               <p>"While the villains of Low Furness were thus distributed over the land, and employed
                  in agriculture; those of High Furness were charged with the care of flocks and herds,
                  to protect them from the wolves which lurked in the thickets, and in winter to browze
                  them with the tender sprouts of hollies and ash. This custom was not till lately discontinued
                  in High Furness; and holly-trees were carefully preserved for that purpose when all
                  other wood was cleared off; large tracts of common being so covered with these trees,
                  as to have the appearance of a forest of hollies. At the Shepherd's call, the flocks
                  surrounded the hollybush, and received the croppings at his hand, which they greedily
                  nibbled up, bleating for <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1445">[Page]</span> more. The Abbots of Furness enfranchised these pastoral vassals, and permitted them
                  to enclose <em>quillets</em> to their houses, for which they paid encroachment rent."—West's <em>Antiquities of Furness.</em></p>
               <p>However desirable, for the purposes of defence, a numerous population might be, it
                  was not possible to make at once the same numerous allotments among the untilled vallies,
                  and upon the sides of the mountains, as had been made in the cultivated plains. The
                  enfranchised shepherd, or woodlander, having chosen there his place of residence,
                  builds it of sods, or of the mountain-stone, and, with the permission of his lord,
                  encloses, like Robinson Crusoe, a small croft or two immediately at his door for such
                  animals as he wishes to protect. Others are happy to imitate his example, and avail
                  themselves of the same privileges: and thus a population, mainly of Danish or Norse
                  origin, as the dialect indicates, crept on towards the more secluded parts of the
                  vallies. Chapels, daughters of some distant mother church, are first erected in the
                  more open and fertile vales, as those of Bowness and Grasmere, offsets of Kendal:
                  which again, after a period, as the settled population increases, become mother-churches
                  to smaller edifices, planted, at length, in almost every dale throughout the country.
                  The inclosures, formed by the tenantry, are for a long time confined to the home-steads;
                  and the arable and meadow land of the vales is possessed in common field; the <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1454">[Page]</span> several portions being marked out by stones, bushes, or trees: which portions, where
                  the custom has survived, to this day are called <em>dales</em>, from the word <em>deylen</em>, to distribute; but, while the valley was thus lying open, enclosures seem to have
                  taken place upon the sides of the mountains; because the land there was not intermixed,
                  and was of little comparative value; and, therefore, small opposition would be made
                  to its being appropriated by those to whose habitations it was contiguous. Hence the
                  singular appearance which the sides of many of these mountains exhibit, intersected,
                  as they are, almost to the summit, with stone walls. When first erected, these stone
                  fences must have little disfigured the face of the country; as part of the lines would
                  every where be hidden by the quantity of native wood then remaining; and the lines
                  would also be broken (as they still are) by the rocks which interrupt and vary their
                  course. In the meadows, and in those parts of the lower grounds where the soil has
                  not been sufficiently drained, and could not afford a stable foundation, there, when
                  the increasing value of land, and the inconvenience suffered from intermixed plots
                  of ground in common field, had induced each inhabitant to enclose his own, they were
                  compelled to make the fences of alders, willows, and other trees. These, where the
                  native wood had disappeared, have frequently enriched the vallies with a sylvan appearance;
                  while the intricate intermixture of property has given <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1462">[Page]</span> to the fences a graceful irregularity, which, where large properties are prevalent,
                  and large capitals employed in agriculture, is unknown. This sylvan appearance is
                  heightened by the number of ash-trees planted in rows along the quick fences, and
                  along the walls, for the purpose of browzing the cattle at the approach of winter.
                  The branches are lopped off and strewn upon the pastures; and when the cattle have
                  stripped them of the leaves, they are used for repairing the hedges or for fuel.
               </p>
               <p>We have thus seen a numerous body of Dalesmen creeping into possession of their home-steads,
                  their little crofts, their mountain-enclosures; and, finally, the whole vale is visibly
                  divided; except, perhaps, here and there some marshy ground, which, till fully drained,
                  would not repay the trouble of enclosing. But these last partitions do not seem to
                  have been general, till long after the pacification of the Borders, by the union of
                  the two crowns: when the cause, which had first determined the distribution of land
                  into such small parcels, had not only ceased,—but likewise a general improvement had
                  taken place in the country, with a correspondent rise in the value of its produce.
                  From the time of the union, it is certain that this species of feudal population must
                  rapidly have diminished. That it was formerly much more numerous than it is at present,
                  is evident from the multitude of tenements (I do not mean houses, but small divisions
                  of land) which belonged formerly each <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1466">[Page]</span> to a several proprietor, and for which separate fines are paid to the manorial lord
                  at this day. These are often in the proportion of four to one of the present occupants.
                  "<a class="colorbox-node" href="n099.html">Sir Launcelot</a> Threlkeld, who lived in the reign of Henry VII., was wont to say, he had three noble
                  houses, one for pleasure, Crosby, in Westmoreland, where he had a park full of deer;
                  one for profit and warmth, wherein to reside in winter, namely, Yanwith, nigh Penrith;
                  and the third, Threlkeld, (on the edge of the vale of Keswick), well stocked with
                  tenants to go with him to the wars." But, as I have said, from the union of the two
                  crowns, this numerous vassalage (their services not being wanted) would rapidly diminish;
                  various tenements would be united in one possessor; and the aboriginal houses, probably
                  little better than hovels, like the kraels of savages, or the huts of the Highlanders
                  of Scotland, would fall into decay, and the places of many be supplied by substantial
                  and comfortable buildings, a majority of which remain to this day scattered over the
                  vallies, and are often the only dwellings found in them.
               </p>
               <p>From the time of the erection of these houses, till within the last sixty years, the
                  state of society, though no doubt slowly and gradually improving, underwent no material
                  change. Corn was grown in these vales (through which no carriage-road had yet been
                  made) sufficient upon each estate to furnish bread for each family, and no more: notwithstanding
                  the union of several tenements, the possessions of each <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1473">[Page]</span> inhabitant still being small, in the same field was seen an intermixture of different
                  crops; and the plough was interrupted by little rocks, mostly overgrown with wood,
                  or by spongy places, which the tillers of the soil had neither leisure nor capital
                  to convert into firm land. The storms and moisture of the climate induced them to
                  sprinkle their upland property with outhouses of native stone, as places of shelter
                  for their sheep, where, in tempestuous weather, food was distributed to them. Every
                  family spun from its own flock the wool with which it was clothed; a weaver was here
                  and there found among them; and the rest of their wants was supplied by the produce
                  of the yarn, which they carded and spun in their own houses, and carried to market,
                  either under their arms, or more frequently on pack-horses, a small train taking their
                  way weekly down the valley or over the mountains to the most commodious town. They
                  had, as I have said, their rural chapel, and of course their minister, in clothing
                  or in manner of life, in no respect differing from themselves, except on the Sabbath-day;
                  this was the sole distinguished individual among them; every thing else, person and
                  possession, exhibited a perfect equality, a community of shepherds and agriculturists,
                  proprietors, for the most part, of the lands which they occupied and cultivated.
               </p>
               <p>While the process above detailed was going on, the native forest must have been every
                  where receding; but trees were planted for <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1478">[Page]</span> the sustenance of the flocks in winter,—such was then the rude state of agriculture;
                  and, for the same cause, it was necessary that care should be taken of some part of
                  the growth of the native woods. Accordingly, in Queen Elizabeth's time, this was so
                  strongly felt, that a petition was made to the Crown, praying, "<a class="colorbox-node" href="n100.html">that the Blomaries in High Furness might be abolished</a>, on account of the quantity of wood which was consumed in them for the use of the
                  mines, to the great detriment of the cattle." But this same cause, about a hundred
                  years after, produced effects directly contrary to those which had been deprecated.
                  The re-establishment, at that period, of furnaces upon a large scale, made it the
                  interest of the people to convert the steeper and more stony of the enclosures, sprinkled
                  over with remains of the native forest, into close woods, which, when cattle and sheep
                  were excluded, rapidly sowed and thickened themselves. The reader's attention has
                  been directed to the cause by which tufts of wood, pasturage, meadow, and arable land,
                  with its various produce, are intricately intermingled in the same field; and he will
                  now see, in like manner, how enclosures entirely of wood, and those of cultivated
                  ground, are blended all over the country under a law of similar wildness.
               </p>
               <p>An historic detail has thus been given of the manner in which the hand of man has
                  acted upon the surface of the inner regions of this mountainous country, as incorporated
                  with <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1485">[Page]</span> and subservient to the powers and processes of nature. We will now take a view of
                  the same agency—acting, within narrower bounds, for the production of the few works
                  of art and accommodations of life which, in so simple a state of society, could be
                  necessary. These are merely habitations of man and coverts for beasts, roads and bridges,
                  and places of worship.
               </p>
               <p>And to begin with the COTTAGES. They are scattered over the vallies, and under the
                  hill sides, and on the rocks; and, even to this day, in the more retired dales, without
                  any intrusion of more assuming buildings;

               <p>The dwelling-houses, and contiguous outhouses, are, in many instances, of the colour
                  of the native rock, out of which they have been built; but, frequently the Dwelling
                  or Fire-house, as it is ordinarily called, has been distinguished from the barn or
                  byer by <a class="colorbox-node" href="n102.html">rough-cast and white wash</a>, which, as the inhabitants are not hasty in renewing it, in a few years acquires,
                  by the influence of weather, a tint at once sober and variegated. As these houses
                  have been, from father to son, inhabited by persons engaged in the same occupations,
                  yet necessarily with changes in their circumstances, they have received without incongru<span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1508">[Page]</span>ity additions and accommodations adapted to the needs of each successive occupant,
                  who, being for the most part proprietor, was at liberty to follow his own fancy: so
                  that these humble dwellings remind the contemplative spectator of a production of
                  nature, and may (using a strong expression) rather be said to have grown than to have
                  been erected;—to have risen, by an instinct of their own, out of the native rock—so
                  little is there in them of formality, such is their wildness and beauty. Among the
                  numerous recesses and projections in the walls and in the different stages of their
                  roofs, are seen bold and harmonious effects of contrasted sunshine and shadow. It
                  is a favourable circumstance, that the strong winds, which sweep down the vallies,
                  induced the inhabitants, at a time when the materials for building were easily procured,
                  to furnish many of these dwellings with substantial porches; and such as have not
                  this defence, are seldom unprovided with a projection of two large slates over their
                  thresholds. Nor will <a class="colorbox-node" href="n103.html">the singular beauty of the chimneys</a> escape the eye of the attentive traveller. Sometimes a low chimney, almost upon a
                  level with the roof, is overlaid with a slate, supported upon four slender pillars,
                  to prevent the wind from driving the smoke down the chimney. Others are of a quadrangular
                  shape, rising one or two feet above the roof; which low square is often surmounted
                  by a tall cylinder, giving to the cottage chimney the most beautiful shape in <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1513">[Page]</span> which it is ever seen. Nor will it be too fanciful or refined to remark, that there
                  is a pleasing harmony between a tall chimney of this circular form, and the living
                  column of smoke, ascending from it through the still air. These dwellings, mostly
                  built, as has been said, of rough unhewn stone, are roofed with slates, which were
                  rudely taken from the quarry before the present art of splitting them was understood,
                  and are, therefore, rough and uneven in their surface, so that both the coverings
                  and sides of the houses have furnished places of rest for the seeds of lichens, mosses,
                  ferns, and flowers. Hence buildings, which in their very form call to mind the processes
                  of nature, do thus, clothed in part with a vegetable garb, appear to be received into
                  the bosom of the living principle of things, as it acts and exists among the woods
                  and fields; and, by their colour and their shape, affectingly direct the thoughts
                  to that tranquil course of nature and simplicity, along which the humble-minded inhabitants
                  have, through so many generations, been led. Add the little garden with its shed for
                  bee-hives, its small bed of pot-herbs, and its borders and patches of flowers for
                  Sunday posies, with sometimes a choice few too much prized to be plucked; an orchard
                  of proportioned size; a cheesepress, often supported by some tree near the door; a
                  cluster of embowering sycamores for summer shade; with a tall fir, through which the
                  winds sing when other trees are leafless; <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1515">[Page]</span> the little rill or household spout murmuring in all seasons;—combine these incidents
                  and images together, and you have the representative idea of a mountain-cottage in
                  this country so beautifully formed in itself, and so richly adorned by the hand of
                  nature.
               </p>
               <p>Till within the last sixty years there was no communication between any of these vales
                  by carriage-roads; all bulky articles were transported on pack-horses. Owing, however,
                  to the population not being concentrated in villages, but scattered, the vallies themselves
                  were intersected as now by innumerable lanes and path-ways leading from house to house
                  and from field to field. These lanes, where they are fenced by stone walls, are mostly
                  bordered with ashes, hazels, wild roses, and beds of tall fern at their base; while
                  the walls themselves, if old, are overspread with mosses, small ferns, wild strawberries,
                  the geranium, and lichens: and, if the wall happen to rest against a bank of earth,
                  it is sometimes almost wholly concealed by a rich facing of stone-fern. It is a great
                  advantage to a traveller or resident, that these numerous lanes and paths, if he be
                  a zealous admirer of nature, will lead him on into all the recesses of the country,
                  so that the hidden treasures of its landscapes may, by an ever-ready guide, be laid
                  open to his eyes.

                     models of elegance, as if they had been formed upon principles of the most thoughtful
                     architecture. It is to be regretted that these monuments of the skill of our ancestors,

                     of the dwelling houses and other structures. How sacred the spirit by which our forefathers
                     were directed! The <em><a class="colorbox-node" href="n105.html">religio loci</a></em> is no where violated by these unstinted, yet unpretending, works of human hands. They
                     exhibit generally a well-proportioned oblong, with a suitable porch, in some instances
                     a steeple tower, and in others nothing more than a small belfry, in which one or two
                     bells hang visibly. But these objects, though pleasing in their forms, must <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1546">[Page]</span> necessarily, more than others in rural scenery, derive their interest from the sentiments
                     of piety and reverence for the modest virtues and simple manners of humble life with
                     which they may be contemplated. A man must be very insensible who would not be touched

                     the passenger, in connection with the surrounding mountains, the depth of that seclusion
                     in which the people live, that has rendered necessary the building of a separate place
                     of worship for so few. A patriot, calling to mind the images of the stately fabrics
                     of Canterbury, York, or Westminster, will find a heart-felt satisfaction in presence
                     of this lowly pile, as a monument of the wise institutions of our country, and as
                     evidence of the all-pervading and paternal care of that venerable Establishment, of
                     which it is, perhaps, the humblest daughter. The edifice is scarcely larger than many

                  have been places of defence against the <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1555">[Page]</span> incursions of the Scottish borderers; and they not unfrequently retain their towers
                  and battlements. To these houses, parks are sometimes attached, and to their successive
                  proprietors we chiefly owe whatever ornament is still left to the country of majestic
                  timber. Through the open parts of the vales are scattered, also, houses of a middle
                  rank between the pastoral cottage and the old hall residence of the knight or esquire.
                  Such houses differ much from the rugged cottages before described, and are generally
                  graced with a little court or garden in front, where may yet be seen specimens of
                  those fantastic and quaint figures which our ancestors were fond of shaping out in
                  yew-tree, holly, or box-wood. The passenger will sometimes smile at such elaborate
                  display of petty art, while the house does not deign to look upon the natural beauty
                  or the sublimity which its situation almost unavoidably commands.

                     of which existed in the midst of a powerful empire like an ideal society or an organized
                     community, whose constitution had been imposed and regulated by the mountains which
                     protected it. Neither high-born nobleman, knight, nor esquire was here; but many of

                  select parts of natural scenery: and <a class="colorbox-node" href="n111.html">Travellers</a>, instead of confining their observations to Towns, Manufactories, or Mines, began
                  (a thing till then unheard of) to wander over the island in search of sequestered
                  spots, distinguished as they might accidentally have learned, for the sublimity or
                  beauty of the forms of Nature there to be seen. —<a class="colorbox-node" href="n112.html">Dr. Brown</a>, the celebrated Author of the Estimate of the Manners and Principles of the Times,
                  published a letter to a friend, in which the attractions of the Vale of Keswick were
                  delineated with a powerful pencil, and the feeling of a genuine Enthusiast. <a class="colorbox-node" href="n113.html">Gray, the Poet</a>, followed: he died soon after his forlorn and melancholy pilgrimage to the Vale of
                  Keswick, and the record left behind him of what he had seen and felt in this journey,
                  excited that pensive interest with which the human mind is ever disposed to listen
                  to the farewell words <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1604">[Page]</span> of a man of genius. The journal of Gray feelingly showed how the gloom of ill-health
                  and low spirits had been irradiated by objects, which the Author's powers of mind
                  enabled him to describe with distinctness and unaffected simplicity. Every reader
                  of this journal must have been impressed with the words which conclude <a class="colorbox-node" href="n114.html">his notice of the Vale of Grasmere</a>:—"Not a single red tile, no flaring gentleman's house or garden-wall, breaks in upon
                  the repose of this little unsuspected paradise; but all is peace, rusticity, and happy
                  poverty, in its neatest and most becoming attire."
               </p>
               <p>What is here so justly said of Grasmere applied almost equally to all its sister Vales.
                  It was well for the undisturbed pleasure of the Poet that he had no forebodings of
                  the change which was soon to take place; and it might have been hoped that these words,
                  indicating how much the charm of what <em>was</em> depended upon what was <em>not</em>, would of themselves have preserved the ancient franchises of this and other kindred
                  mountain retirements from trespass; or (shall I dare to say?) would have secured scenes
                  so consecrated from profanation. The lakes had now become celebrated; visitors flocked
                  hither from all parts of England; the fancies of some were smitten so deeply that
                  they became settlers; and the Islands of Derwentwater and Winandermere, as they offered
                  the strongest temptation, were the first places seized upon, and were instantly defaced
                  by the intrusion. <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1617">[Page]</span></p>
               <p>The venerable wood that had grown for centuries round the small house called <a class="colorbox-node" href="n115.html">St. Herbert's Hermitage</a>, had indeed some years before been felled by its native proprietor, and the whole
                  island planted anew with Scotch firs, left to spindle up by each other's side—a melancholy
                  phalanx, defying the power of the winds, and disregarding the regret of the spectator,
                  who might otherwise have cheated himself into a belief that some of the decayed remains
                  of those oaks, the place of which was in this manner usurped, had been planted by
                  the Hermit's own hand: This sainted spot, however, suffered comparatively little injury.
                  At the bidding of <a class="colorbox-node" href="n116.html">an alien improver</a>, the Hind's Cottage, upon <a class="colorbox-node" href="n117.html">Vicar's island</a>, in the same lake, with its embowering sycamores and cattle-shed, disappeared from
                  the corner where they stood; and right in the middle, and upon the precise point of
                  the island's highest elevation, rose a tall square habitation, with four sides exposed,
                  like an astronomer's observatory, or a warrenhouse reared upon an eminence for the
                  detection of depredators, or, like the temple of <a class="colorbox-node" href="n118.html">Œolus</a>, where all the winds pay him obeisance. Round this novel structure, but at a respectful
                  distance, platoons of firs were stationed, as if to protect their commander when weather
                  and time should somewhat have shattered his strength. Within the narrow limits of
                  this island were typified also the state and strength of a kingdom, and its religion
                  as it had been, and was,—for neither was the druidical circle <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1632">[Page]</span> uncreated, nor the church of the present establishment; nor the stately pier, emblem
                  of commerce and navigation; nor the fort to deal out thunder upon the approaching
                  invader. The taste of a succeeding proprietor rectified the mistakes as far as was
                  practicable, and has ridded the spot of its puerilities. The church, after having
                  been docked of its steeple, is applied, both ostensibly and really, to the purpose
                  for which the body of the pile was actually erected, namely, a boat-house; the fort
                  is demolished; and, without indignation on the part of the spirits of the ancient
                  Druids who officiated at <a class="colorbox-node" href="n119.html">the circle upon the opposite hill</a>, the mimic arrangement of stones, with its <em><a class="colorbox-node" href="n120.html">sanctum santorum</a></em>, has been swept away.

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The present instance has been singled out, extravagant as it is, because, unquestionably,
                     this beautiful country has, in numerous other places, suffered from the same spirit,
                     though not clothed exactly in the same form, nor active in an equal degree. It will
                     be sufficient here to utter a regret for the <a class="colorbox-node" href="n121.html">changes that have been made upon the principal Island at Winandermere</a>, and in its neighbourhood. What could be more unfortunate than the taste that suggested
                     the paring of the shores, and surrounding with an embankment this spot of ground,
                     the natural shape of which was so beautiful! An artificial appearance has thus been
                     given to the whole, while infinite varieties of minute beauty have been destroyed.
                     Could not the margin of this noble island be <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1647">[Page]</span> given back to nature? Winds and waves work with a careless and graceful hand: and,
                     should they in some places carry away a portion of the soil, the trifling loss would
                     be amply compensated by the additional spirit, dignity, and loveliness, which these
                     agents and the other powers of nature would soon communicate to what was left behind.
                     As to the larch-plantations upon the main shore,—they who remember the original appearance
                     of the rocky steeps, scattered over with native hollies and ash-trees, will be prepared
                     to agree with what I shall have to say hereafter upon plantations

               <p>But, in truth, no one can now travel through the more frequented tracts, without being
                  offended, at almost every turn, by an introduction of discordant objects, disturbing
                  that peaceful harmony of form and colour, which had been through a long lapse of ages
                  most happily preserved. 
               </p>
               <p>All gross transgressions of this kind originate, doubtless, in a feeling natural and
                  honourable to the human mind, viz. the pleasure which it receives from distinct ideas,
                  and from the perception of order, regularity, and contrivance. Now, unpractised minds
                  receive these impressions only from objects that are divided from each other by strong
                  lines of demarcation; hence the delight with which such minds are <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1656">[Page]</span> smitten by formality and harsh contrast. But I would beg of those who are eager to
                  create the means of such gratification, first carefully to study what already exists;
                  and they will find, in a country so lavishly gifted by nature, an abundant variety
                  of forms marked out with a precision that will satisfy their desires. Moreover, a
                  new habit of pleasure will be formed opposite to this, arising out of the perception
                  of the fine gradations by which in nature one thing passes away into another, and
                  the boundaries that constitute individuality disappear in one instance only to be
                  revived elsewhere under a more alluring form. The hill of Dunmallet, at the foot of
                  Ulswater, was once divided into different portions, by avenues of fir-trees, with
                  a green and almost perpendicular lane descending down the steep hill through each
                  avenue;—contrast this quaint appearance with the image of the same hill overgrown
                  with self-planted wood,—each tree springing up in the situation best suited to its
                  kind, and with that shape which the situation constrained or suffered it to take.
                  What endless melting and playing into each other of forms and colours does the one
                  offer to a mind at once attentive and active; and how insipid and lifeless, compared
                  with it, appear those parts of the former exhibition with which a child, a peasant
                  perhaps, or a citizen unfamiliar with natural imagery, would have been most delighted!
               </p>
               <p>The disfigurement which this country has <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1660">[Page]</span> undergone, has not, however, proceeded wholly from the common feelings of human nature
                  which have been referred to as the primary sources of bad taste in rural imagery;
                  another cause must be added, that has chiefly shown itself in its effect upon buildings.
                  I mean a warping of the natural mind occasioned by a consciousness that, this country
                  being an object of general admiration, every new house would be looked at and commented
                  upon either for approbation or censure. Hence all the deformity and ungracefulness
                  that ever pursue the steps of constraint or affectation. Persons, who in Leicestershire
                  or Northamptonshire would probably have built a modest dwelling like those of their
                  sensible neighbours, have been turned out of their course; and, acting a part, no
                  wonder if, having had little experience, they act it ill. The craving for prospect,
                  also, which is immoderate, particularly in new settlers, has rendered it impossible
                  that buildings, whatever might have been their architecture, should in most instances
                  be ornamental to the landscape; rising as they do from the summits of naked hills
                  in staring contrast to the snugness and privacy of the ancient houses.
               </p>
               <p>No man is to be condemned for a desire to decorate his residence and possessions;
                  feeling a disposition to applaud such an endeavour, I would show how the end may be
                  best attained. The rule is simple; with respect to grounds—work, where you can, in
                  the spirit <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1664">[Page]</span> of nature, with an invisible hand of art. Planting, and a removal of wood, may thus,
                  and thus only, be carried on with good effect; and the like may be said of building,
                  if Antiquity, who may be styled the co-partner and sister of Nature, be not denied
                  the respect to which she is entitled. I have already spoken of the beautiful forms
                  of the ancient mansions of this country, and of the happy manner in which they harmonise
                  with the forms of nature. Why cannot such be taken as a model, and modern internal
                  convenience be confined within their external grace and dignity? Expense to be avoided,
                  or difficulties to be overcome, may prevent a close adherence to this model; still,
                  however, it might be followed to a certain degree in the style of architecture and
                  in the choice of situation, if the thirst for prospect were mitigated by those considerations
                  of comfort, shelter, and convenience, which used to be chiefly sought after. But should
                  an aversion to old fashions unfortunately exist, accompanied with a desire to transplant
                  into the cold and stormy North, the elegancies of a villa formed upon a model taken
                  from countries with a milder climate, I will adduce <a class="colorbox-node" href="n122.html">a passage from an English poet, the divine Spenser</a>, which will show in what manner such a plan may be realised without injury to the
                  native beauty of these scenes.

               <p>Houses or mansions suited to a mountainous region, should be "<a class="colorbox-node" href="n123.html">not obvious, not obtrusive, but retired</a>;" and the reasons for this rule, though they have been little adverted to, are evident.
                  Mountainous countries, more frequently and forcibly than others, remind us of the
                  power of the elements, as manifested in winds, snows, and torrents, and accordingly
                  make the notion of exposure very unpleasing; while shelter and comfort are in proportion
                  necessary and acceptable. Far-winding vallies difficult of access, and the feelings
                  of simplicity habitually connected with mountain retirements, prompt us to turn from
                  ostentation as a thing there eminently unnatural and out of place. A mansion, amid
                  such scenes, can never have sufficient dignity or interest to become principal in
                  the landscape, and to render the mountains, lakes, or torrents, by which it may be
                  surrounded, a subordinate <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1722">[Page]</span> part of the view. It is, I grant, easy to conceive, that an ancient castellated building,
                  hanging over a precipice or raised upon an island, or the peninsula of a lake, like
                  that of <a class="colorbox-node" href="n124.html">Kilchurn Castle, upon Loch Awe</a>, may not want, whether deserted or inhabited, sufficient majesty to preside for a
                  moment in the spectator's thoughts over the high mountains among which it is embosomed;
                  but its titles are from antiquity—a power readily submitted to upon occasion as the
                  vicegerent of Nature: it is respected, as having owed its existence to the necessities
                  of things, as a monument of security in times of disturbance and danger long passed
                  away,—as a record of the pomp and violence of passion, and a symbol of the wisdom
                  of law;—it bears a countenance of authority, which is not impaired by decay.

               <p>To such honours a modern edifice can lay no claim; and the puny efforts of elegance
                  appear contemptible, when, in such situations, they are obtruded in rivalship with
                  the sublimities of Nature. But, towards the verge of a district like this of which
                  we are treating, where the mountains subside into hills of moderate elevation, or
                  in an undulating or flat country, a gentleman's mansion may, with propriety, become
                  a principal feature in the landscape; <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1739">[Page]</span> and, itself being a work of art, works and traces of artificial ornament may, without
                  censure, be extended around it, as they will be referred to the common centre, the
                  house; the right of which to impress within certain limits a character of obvious
                  ornament will not be denied, where no commanding forms of nature dispute it, or set
                  it aside. Now, to a want of the perception of this difference, and to the causes before
                  assigned, may chiefly be attributed the disfigurement which the Country of the Lakes
                  has undergone, from persons who may have built, demolished, and planted, with full
                  confidence, that every change and addition was or would become an improvement.

               <p>The principle that ought to determine the position, apparent size, and architecture
                  of a house, viz. that it should be so constructed, and (if large) so much of it hidden,
                  as to admit of its being gently incorporated into the scenery of nature—should also
                  determine its colour. <a class="colorbox-node" href="n126.html">Sir Joshua Reynolds used to say</a>, "If you would fix upon the best colour for your house, turn up a stone, or pluck
                  up a handful of grass by the roots, and see what is the colour of the soil where the
                  house is to stand, and let that be your choice." Of course, this precept given in
                  conversation, could not have been meant to be taken literally. For example, in <a class="colorbox-node" href="n127.html">Low Furness</a>, where the soil, from its strong impregnation with iron, is universally of a deep
                  red, if this rule <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1749">[Page]</span> were strictly followed, the house also must be of a glaring red; in other places
                  it must be of a sullen black; which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance. The
                  rule, however, as a general guide, is good; and, in agricultural districts, where
                  large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough, particularly if (the face of the
                  country being undulating) they are held up to view, this rule, though not to be implicitly
                  adhered to, should never be lost sight of;—the colour of the house ought, if possible,
                  to have a cast or shade of the colour of the soil. The principle is, that the house
                  must harmonise with the surrounding landscape: accordingly, in mountainous countries,
                  with still more confidence may it be said, "look at the rocks and those parts of the
                  mountains where the soil is visible, and they will furnish a safe direction." Nevertheless,
                  it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of
                  the landscape, and may be of such a tone of colour, that the rule may not admit, even
                  here, of being implicitly followed. For instance, the chief defect in the colouring
                  of the Country of the Lakes (which is most strongly felt in the summer season) is
                  an over-prevalence of a bluish tint, which the green of the herbage, the fern, and
                  the woods, does not sufficiently counteract. If a house, therefore, should stand where
                  this defect prevails, I have no hesitation in saying, that the colour of the neighbouring
                  rocks would not be the best that <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1751">[Page]</span> could be chosen. A tint ought to be introduced approaching nearer to those which,
                  in the technical language of painters, are called <em>warm</em>: this, if happily selected, would not disturb, but would animate the landscape. How
                  often do we see this exemplified upon a small scale by the native cottages, in cases
                  where the glare of white-wash has been subdued by time and enriched by weather-stains!
                  No harshness is then seen; but one of these cottages, thus coloured, will often form
                  a central point to a landscape by which the whole shall be connected, and an influence
                  of pleasure diffused over all the objects that compose the picture. But where the
                  cold blue tint of the rocks is enriched by the iron tinge, the colour cannot be too
                  closely imitated; and it will be produced of itself by the stones hewn from the adjoining
                  quarry, and by the mortar, which may be tempered with the most gravelly part of the
                  soil. The pure blue gravel, from the bed of the river, is, however, more suitable
                  to the mason's purpose, who will probably insist also that the house must be covered
                  with rough-cast, otherwise it cannot be kept dry; if this advice be taken, the builder
                  of taste will set about contriving such means as may enable him to come the nearest
                  to the effect aimed at.
               </p>
               <p>The supposed necessity of rough-cast to keep out rain in houses not built of hewn
                  stone or brick, has tended greatly to injure English landscape, and the neighbourhood
                  of these <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1758">[Page]</span> Lakes especially, by furnishing such apt occasion for whitening buildings. That white
                  should be a favourite colour for rural residences is natural for many reasons. The
                  mere aspect of cleanliness and neatness thus given, not only to an individual house,
                  but, where the practice is general, to the whole face of the country, produces moral
                  associations so powerful, that, in many minds, they take place of all others. But
                  what has already been said upon the subject of cottages, must have convinced men of
                  feeling and imagination, that a human dwelling of the humblest class may be rendered
                  more deeply interesting to the affections, and far more pleasing to the eye, by other
                  influences, than a sprightly tone of colour spread over its outside. I do not, however,
                  mean to deny, that a small white building, embowered in trees, may, in some situations,
                  be a delightful and animating object—in no way injurious to the landscape; but this
                  only where it sparkles from the midst of a thick shade, and in rare and solitary instances;
                  especially if the country be itself rich and pleasing, and abound with grand forms.
                  On the sides of bleak and desolate moors, we are indeed thankful for the sight of
                  white cottages and white houses plentifully scattered, where, without these, perhaps
                  every thing would be cheerless: this is said, however, with hesitation, and with a
                  wilful sacrifice of some higher enjoyments. But I have certainly seen such buildings
                  glittering at sunrise, and in wandering lights, with no common pleasure. <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1760">[Page]</span> The continental traveller also will remember, that the convents hanging from the
                  rocks of the Rhine, the Rhone, the Danube, or among the Appenines, or the mountains
                  of Spain, are not looked at with less complacency when, as is often the case, they
                  happen to be of a brilliant white. But this is perhaps owing, in no small degree,
                  to the contrast of that lively colour with the gloom of monastic life, and to the
                  general want of rural residences of smiling and attractive appearance, in those countries.
               </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The objections to white, as a colour, in large spots or masses in landscape, especially
                     in a mountainous country, are insurmountable. In nature, pure white is scarcely ever
                     found but in small objects, such as flowers; or in those which are transitory, as
                     the clouds, foam of rivers, and snow. <a class="colorbox-node" href="n128.html">Mr. Gilpin, who notices this, has also recorded the just remark of Mr. Locke</a>, of N-----, that white destroys the <em>gradations</em> of distance; and, therefore, an object of pure white can scarcely ever be managed
                     with good effect in landscape-painting. Five or six white houses, scattered over a
                     valley, by their obtrusiveness, dot the surface, and divide it into triangles, or
                     other mathematical figures, haunting the eye, and disturbing that repose which might
                     otherwise be perfect. I have seen <a class="colorbox-node" href="n129.html">a single white house</a> materially impair the majesty of a mountain; cutting away, by a harsh separation,
                     the whole of its base, below the point on which the house stood. Thus was the apparent
                     size of the mountain reduced, <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1773">[Page]</span> not by the interposition of another object in a manner to call forth the imagination,
                     which will give more than the eye loses; but what had been abstracted in this case
                     was left visible; and the mountain appeared to take its beginning, or to rise, from
                     the line of the house, instead of its own natural base. But, if I may express my own
                     individual feeling, it is after sunset, at the coming on of twilight, that white objects
                     are most to be complained of. The solemnity and quietness of nature at that time are
                     always marred, and often destroyed by them. When the ground is covered with snow,
                     they are of course inoffensive; and in moonshine they are always pleasing—it is a
                     tone of light with which they accord: and the dimness of the scene is enlivened by
                     an object at once conspicuous and cheerful. I will conclude this subject with noticing
                     that the cold, slaty colour, which many persons, who have heard the white condemned,
                     have adopted in its stead, must be disapproved of for the reason already given. The
                     flaring yellow runs into the opposite extreme, and is still more censurable. Upon
                     the whole, the safest colour for general use is something between a cream and a dustcolour,
                     commonly called stone colour;—there are, among the Lakes, examples of this that need
                     not be pointed out.

               <p>The principle taken as our guide, viz. that the house should be so formed, and of
                  such apparent size and colour, as to admit of its being gently incorporated with the
                  works of nature, should also be applied to the management of the grounds and plantations,
                  and is here more urgently needed; for it is from abuses in this department, far more
                  even than from the introduction of exotics in architecture (if the phrase may be used),
                  that this country has suffered. <a class="colorbox-node" href="n130.html">Larch and fir plantations</a> have been spread, not merely with a view to profit, but in many instances for the
                  sake of ornament. To those who plant for profit, and are thrusting every other tree
                  out of the way, to make room for their favourite, the larch, I would utter first a
                  regret that they should have selected these lovely vales for their vegetable manufactory,
                  when there is so much barren and irreclaimable land in the neighbouring moors, and
                  in other parts of the island, which might have been had for this purpose at a far
                  cheaper rate. And I will also beg leave to represent to them, that they ought not
                  to be carried away by flattering promises from the speedy growth of this tree; because
                  in rich soils and sheltered situations, the wood, though it thrives fast, is full
                  of sap and of little value; and is, likewise, very subject to ravage from the attacks
                  of insects, and from blight. Accordingly, in Scotland, where planting is much better
                  understood, and carried on upon an incomparably larger scale than among us, good soil
                  and sheltered situations are appropriated to the oak, the ash, <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1786">[Page]</span> and other deciduous trees; and the larch is now generally confined to barren and
                  exposed ground. There the plant, which is a hardy one, is of slower growth; much less
                  liable to injury; and the timber is of better quality. But the circumstances of many
                  permit, and their taste leads them, to plant with little regard to profit; and there
                  are others, less wealthy, who have such a lively feeling of the native beauty of these
                  scenes, that they are laudably not unwilling to make some sacrifices to heighten it.
                  Both these classes of persons, I would entreat to inquire of themselves wherein that
                  beauty which they admire consists. They would then see that, after the feeling has
                  been gratified that prompts us to gather round our dwelling a few flowers and shrubs,
                  which from the circumstance of their not being native, may, by their very looks, remind
                  us that they owe their existence to our hands, and their prosperity to our care; they
                  will see that, after this natural desire has been provided for, the course of all
                  beyond has been predetermined by the spirit of the place. Before I proceed, I will
                  remind those who are not satisfied with the restraint thus laid upon them, that they
                  are liable to a charge of inconsistency, when they are so eager to change the face
                  of that country, whose native attractions, by the act of erecting their habitations
                  in it, they have so emphatically acknowledged. And surely there is not a single spot
                  that would not have, if well managed, sufficient dignity to support itself, <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1788">[Page]</span> unaided by the productions of other climates, or by elaborate decorations which might
                  be becoming elsewhere.
               </p>
               <p>Having adverted to the feelings that justify the introduction of a few exotic plants,
                  provided they be confined almost to the doors of the house, we may add that a transition
                  should be contrived, without abruptness, from these foreigners to the rest of the
                  shrubs, which ought to be of the kinds scattered by Nature, through the woods—holly,
                  broom, wild-rose, elder, dogberry, white and black thorn, &amp;.—either these only, or
                  such as are carefully selected in consequence of their being united in form, and harmonising
                  in colour with them, especially with respect to colour, when the tints are most diversified,
                  as in autumn and spring. The various sorts of fruit-and-blossom-bearing trees usually
                  found in orchards, to which may be added those of the woods—namely, the wilding, black
                  cherry tree, and <a class="colorbox-node" href="n131.html">wild cluster-cherry (here called heck-berry)</a>—may be happily admitted as an intermediate link between the shrubs and the forest
                  trees; which last ought almost entirely to be such as are natives of the country.
                  Of the birch, one of the most beautiful of the native trees, it may be noticed that,
                  in dry and rocky situations, it outstrips even the larch, which many persons are tempted
                  to plant merely on account of the speed of its growth. The Scotch fir is less attractive
                  during its youth than any other plant; but, when full-grown, if it has had room to
                  spread out its <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1795">[Page]</span> arms, it becomes a noble tree; and, by those who are disinterested enough to plant
                  for posterity, it may be placed along with the sycamore near the house; for, from
                  their massiveness, both these trees unite well with buildings, and in some situations
                  with rocks also; having, in their forms and apparent substances, the effect of something
                  intermediate betwixt the immoveableness and solidity of stone, and the spray and foliage
                  of the lighter trees. If these general rules be just, what shall we say to whole acres
                  of artificial shrubbery and exotic trees among rocks and dashing torrents, with their
                  own wild wood in sight —where we have the whole contents of the nurseryman's catalogue
                  jumbled together—colour at war with colour, and form with form?—among the most peaceful
                  subjects of Nature's kingdom, everywhere discord, distraction, and bewilderment! But
                  this deformity, bad as it is, is not so obtrusive as the small patches and large tracts
                  of larch-plantations that are overrunning the hill sides. To justify our condemnation
                  of these, let us again recur to Nature. The process by which she forms woods and forests
                  is as follows. Seeds are scattered indiscriminately by winds, brought by waters, and
                  dropped by birds. They perish, or produce, according as the soil and situation upon
                  which they fall are suited to them: and under the same dependence, the seedling or
                  the sucker, if not cropped by animals (which Nature is often careful to prevent by
                  fencing it <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1797">[Page]</span> about with brambles or other prickly shrubs) thrives, and the tree grows, sometimes
                  single, taking its own shape without constraint, but for the most part compelled to
                  conform itself to some law imposed upon it by its neighbours. From low and sheltered
                  places, vegetation travels upwards to the more exposed; and the young plants are protected,
                  and to a certain degree fashioned, by those that have preceded them. The continuous
                  mass of foliage which would be thus produced, is broken by rocks, or by glades or
                  open places, where the browzing of animals has prevented the growth of wood. As vegetation
                  ascends, the winds begin also to bear their part in moulding the forms of the trees;
                  but, thus mutually protected, trees, though not of the hardiest kind, are enabled
                  to climb high up the mountains. Gradually, however, by the quality of the ground,
                  and by increasing exposure, a stop is put to their ascent; the hardy trees only are
                  left: those also, by little and little, give way—and a wild and irregular boundary
                  is established, graceful in its outline, and never contemplated without some feeling,
                  more or less distinct, of the powers of Nature by which it is imposed.
               </p>
               <p>Contrast the liberty that encourages, and the law that limits, this joint work of
                  nature and time, with the disheartening necessities, restrictions, and disadvantages,
                  under which the artificial planter must proceed, even he whom long observation and
                  fine feeling have best qualified for his task. In the first place his trees, how<span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1802">[Page]</span>ever well chosen and adapted to their several situations, must generally start all
                  at the same time; and this necessity would of itself prevent that fine connection
                  of parts, that sympathy and organization, if I may so express myself, which pervades
                  the whole of a natural wood, and appears to the eye in its single trees, its masses
                  of foliage, and their various colours, when they are held up to view on the side of
                  a mountain; or when, spread over a valley, they are looked down upon from an eminence.
                  It is therefore impossible, under any circumstances, for the artificial planter to
                  rival the beauty of nature. But a moment's thought will show that, if ten thousand
                  of this spiky tree, the larch, are stuck in at once upon the side of a hill, they
                  can grow up into nothing but deformity; that, while they are suffered to stand, we
                  shall look in vain for any of those appearances which are the chief sources of beauty
                  in a natural wood.
               </p>
               <p>It must be acknowledged that the larch, till it has outgrown the size of a shrub,
                  shows, when looked at singly, some elegance in form and appearance, especially in
                  spring, decorated, as it then is, by the <a class="colorbox-node" href="n132.html">pink tassels of its blossoms</a>; but, as a tree, it is less than any other pleasing: its branches (for <em>boughs</em> it has none) have no variety in the youth of the tree, and little dignity, even when
                  it attains its full growth; <em>leaves</em> it cannot be said to have, consequently neither affords shade nor shelter. In spring
                  the larch becomes green long before <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1816">[Page]</span> the native trees; and its green is so peculiar and vivid, that, finding nothing to
                  harmonize with it, wherever it comes forth, a disagreeable speck is produced. In summer,
                  when all other trees are in their pride, it is of a dingy lifeless hue; <a class="colorbox-node" href="n133.html">in autumn of a spiritless unvaried yellow</a>, and in winter it is still more lamentably distinguished from every other deciduous
                  tree of the forest, for they seem only to sleep, but the larch appears absolutely
                  dead. If an attempt be made to mingle thickets, or a certain proportion of other forest-trees,
                  with the larch, its horizontal branches intolerantly cut them down as with a scythe,
                  or force them to spindle up to keep pace with it. The terminating spike renders it
                  impossible that the several trees, where planted in numbers, should ever blend together
                  so as to form a mass or masses of wood. Add thousands to tens of thousands, and the
                  appearance is still the same —a collection of separate individual trees, obstinately
                  presenting themselves as such; and which, from whatever point they are looked at,
                  if but seen, may be counted upon the fingers. Sunshine, or shadow, has little power
                  to adorn the surface of such a wood; and the trees not carrying up their heads, the
                  wind raises among them no majestic undulations. It is indeed true, that, in countries
                  where the larch is a native, and where, without interruption, it may sweep from valley
                  to valley, and from hill to hill, a sublime image may be produced by such a forest,
                  in the same manner as <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1822">[Page]</span> by one composed of any other single tree, to the spreading of which no limits can
                  be assigned. For sublimity will never be wanting, where the sense of innumerable multitude
                  is lost in, and alternates with, that of intense unity; and to the ready perception
                  of this effect, similarity and almost identity of individual form and monotony of
                  colour contribute. But this feeling is confined to the native immeasurable forest;
                  no artificial plantation can give it.
               </p>
               <p>The foregoing observations will, I hope, (as nothing has been condemned or recommended
                  without a substantial reason) have some influence upon those who plant for ornament
                  merely. To such as plant for profit, I have already spoken. Let me then entreat that
                  the native deciduous trees may be left in complete possession of the lower ground;
                  and that plantations of larch, if introduced at all, may be confined to the highest
                  and most barren tracts. Interposition of rocks would there break the dreary uniformity
                  of which we have been complaining; and the winds would take hold of the trees, and
                  imprint upon their shapes a wildness congenial to their situation. 
               </p>
               <p>Having determined what kinds of trees must be wholly rejected, or at least very sparingly
                  used, by those who are unwilling to disfigure the country; and having shown what kinds
                  ought to be chosen; I should have given, if my limits had not already been overstepped,
                  a few practical rules for the manner in which trees <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1828">[Page]</span> ought to be disposed in planting. But to this subject I should attach little importance,
                  if I could succeed in banishing such trees as introduce deformity, and could prevail
                  upon the proprietor to confine himself, either to those found in the native woods,
                  or to such as accord with them. This is, indeed, the main point; for, much as these
                  scenes have been injured by what has been taken from them —buildings, trees, and woods,
                  either through negligence, necessity, avarice, or caprice —it is not the removals,
                  but the harsh <em>additions</em> that have been made, which are the worst grievance— a standing and unavoidable annoyance.
                  Often have I felt this distinction, with mingled satisfaction and regret; for, if
                  no positive deformity or discordance be substituted or superinduced, such is the benignity
                  of Nature, that, take away from her beauty after beauty, and ornament after ornament,
                  her appearance cannot be marred——the scars, if any be left, will gradually disappear
                  before a healing spirit; and what remains will still be soothing and pleasing.—

               <p>There are few ancient woods left in this part of England upon which such indiscriminate
                  <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1854">[Page]</span> ravage as is here "deplored," could now be committed. But, out of the numerous copses,
                  fine woods might in time be raised, probably without sacrifice of profit, by leaving,
                  at the periodical fellings, a due proportion of the healthiest trees to grow up into
                  timber.— This plan has fortunately, in many instances, been adopted; and they, who
                  have set the example, are entitled to the thanks of all persons of taste. As to the
                  management of planting with reasonable attention to ornament, let the images of nature
                  be your guide, and the whole secret lurks in a few words; thickets or underwoods—single
                  trees—trees clustered or in groups—groves—unbroken woods, but with varied masses of
                  foliage—glades—invisible or winding boundaries—in rocky districts, a seemly proportion
                  of rock left wholly bare, and other parts half hidden—disagreeable objects concealed,
                  and formal lines broken —trees climbing up to the horizon, and, in some places, ascending
                  from its sharp edge, in which they are rooted, with the whole body of the tree appearing
                  to stand in the clear sky —in other parts, woods surmounted by rocks utterly bare
                  and naked, which add to the sense of height, as if vegetation could not thither be
                  carried, and impress a feeling of duration, power of resistance, and security from
                  change!

                  <!--anchor--></a><p>The author has been induced to speak thus at length, by a wish to preserve the native
                  beauty of this delightful district, because still further changes in its appearance
                  must inevi<span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1860">[Page]</span>tably follow, from the change of inhabitants and owners which is rapidly taking place.—About
                  the same time that strangers began to be attracted to the country, and to feel a desire
                  to settle in it, the difficulty, that would have stood in the way of their procuring
                  situations, was lessened by an unfortunate alteration in the circumstances of the
                  native peasantry, proceeding from a cause which then began to operate, and is now
                  felt in every house. The family of each man, whether <em>estatesman</em> or farmer, formerly had a twofold support; first, the produce of his lands and flocks;
                  and, secondly, the profit drawn from the employment of the women and children, as
                  manufacturers; spinning their own wool in their own houses (work chiefly done in the
                  winter season), and carrying it to market for sale. Hence, however numerous the children,
                  the income of the family kept pace with its increase. But, by the invention and universal
                  application of machinery, this second resource has been cut off; the gains being so
                  far reduced, as not to be sought after but by a few aged persons disabled from other
                  employment. Doubtless, the invention of machinery has not been to these people a pure
                  loss; for the profits arising from home-manufactures operated as a strong temptation
                  to choose that mode of labour in neglect of husbandry. They also participate in the
                  general benefit which the island has derived from the increased value of the produce
                  of land, brought about by the estab<span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1866">[Page]</span>lishment of manufactories, and in the consequent quickening of agricultural industry.
                  But this is far from making them amends; and now that home-manufactures are nearly
                  done away, though the women and children might, at many seasons of the year, employ
                  themselves with advantage in the fields beyond what they are accustomed to do, yet
                  still all possible exertion in this way cannot be rationally expected from persons
                  whose agricultural knowledge is so confined, and, above all, where there must necessarily
                  be so small a capital. The consequence, then, is—that proprietors and farmers being
                  no longer able to maintain themselves upon small farms, several are united in one,
                  and the buildings go to decay or are destroyed; and that the lands of the <em>estatesmen</em> being mortgaged, and the owners constrained to part with them, they fall into the
                  hands of wealthy purchasers, who in like manner unite and consolidate; and, if they
                  wish to become residents, erect new mansions out of the ruins of the ancient cottages,
                  whose little enclosures, with all the wild graces that grew out of them, disappear.
                  The feudal tenure under which the estates are held has indeed done something towards
                  checking this influx of new settlers; but so strong is the inclination, that these
                  galling restraints are endured; and it is probable, that in a few years the country
                  on the margin of the Lakes will fall almost entirely into the possession of gentry,
                  either strangers or natives. It is then <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1872">[Page]</span> much to be wished, that a better taste should prevail among these new proprietors;
                  and, as they cannot be expected to leave things to themselves, that skill and knowledge
                  should prevent unnecessary deviations from that path of simplicity and beauty along
                  which, without design and unconsciously, their humble predecessors have moved. In
                  this wish the author will be joined by persons of pure taste throughout the whole
                  island, who, by their visits (often repeated) to the Lakes in the North of England,
                  testify that they deem the district <a class="colorbox-node" href="n135.html">a sort of national property</a>, in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart

               <p><a class="colorbox-node" href="n136.html">MR. WEST</a>, in his well-known Guide to the Lakes, recommends, as the best season for visiting
                  this country, the interval from the beginning of June to the end of August; and, the
                  two latter months being a time of vacation and leisure, it is almost exclusively in
                  these that strangers resort hither. But that season is by no means the best; the colouring
                  of the mountains and woods, unless where they are diversified by rocks, is of too
                  unvaried a green; and, as a large portion of the vallies is allotted to hay-grass,
                  some want of variety is found there also. The meadows, however, are sufficiently enlivened
                  after hay-making begins, which is much later than in the southern part of the island.
                  A stronger objection is rainy weather, setting in sometimes at this period with a
                  vigour, and continuing with a perseverance, that may remind the disappointed and dejected
                  traveller <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1892">[Page]</span> of those deluges of rain which fall among the Abyssinian mountains, for the annual
                  supply of the Nile. The months of September and October (particularly October) are
                  generally attended with much finer weather; and the scenery is then, beyond comparison,
                  more diversified, more splendid, and beautiful; but, on the other hand, short days
                  prevent long excursions, and sharp and chill gales are unfavourable to parties of
                  pleasure out of doors. Nevertheless, to the sincere admirer of nature, who is in good
                  health and spirits, and at liberty to make a choice, the six weeks following the 1st
                  of September may be recommended in preference to July and August. For there is no
                  inconvenience arising from the season which, to such a person, would not be amply
                  compensated by the <em>autumnal</em> appearance of any of the more retired vallies, into which discordant plantations
                  and unsuitable buildings have not yet found entrance.—In such spots, at this season,
                  there is an admirable compass and proportion of natural harmony in colour, through
                  the whole scale of objects; in the tender green of the after-grass upon the meadows,
                  interspersed with islands of grey or mossy rock, crowned by shrubs and trees; in the
                  irregular inclosures of standing corn, or stubble-fields, in like manner broken; in
                  the mountain-sides glowing with fern of divers colours; in the calm blue lakes and
                  river-pools; and in the foliage of the trees, through all the tints of autumn,—from
                  the pale and brilliant yellow <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1897">[Page]</span> of the birch and ash, to the deep greens of the unfaded oak and alder, and of the
                  ivy upon the rocks, upon the trees, and the cottages. Yet, as most travellers are
                  either stinted, or stint themselves, for time, the space between the middle or last
                  week in May, and the middle or last week of June, may be pointed out as affording
                  the best combination of long days, fine weather, and variety of impressions. Few of
                  the native trees are then in full leaf; but, for whatever may be wanting in depth
                  of shade, more than an equivalent will be found in the diversity of foliage, in the
                  blossoms of the fruit-and-berry-bearing trees which abound in the woods, and in the
                  golden flowers of the broom and other shrubs, with which many of the copses are interveined.
                  In those woods, also, and on these mountain sides which have a northern aspect, and
                  in the deep dells, many of the spring-flowers still linger; while the open and sunny
                  places are stocked with the flowers of the approaching summer. And, besides, is not
                  an exquisite pleasure still untasted by him who has not heard the choir of linnets
                  and thrushes chaunting their love-songs in the copses, woods, and hedge-rows of a
                  mountainous country; safe from the birds of prey, which build in the inaccessible
                  crags, and are at all hours seen or heard wheeling about in the air? The number of
                  these formidable creatures is probably the cause why, in the <em>narrow</em> vallies, there are no skylarks; as the destroyer would be enabled to <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1902">[Page]</span> dart upon them from the near and surrounding crags, before they could descend to
                  their ground-nests for protection. <a class="colorbox-node" href="n137.html">It is not often that the nightingale resorts to these vales</a>; but almost all the other tribes of our English warblers are numerous; and their
                  notes, when listened to by the side of broad still waters, or when heard in unison
                  with the murmuring of mountain-brooks, have the compass of their power enlarged accordingly.
                  There is also an imaginative influence in the voice of the cuckoo, when that voice
                  has taken possession of a deep mountain valley, very different from any thing which
                  can be excited by the same sound in a flat country. Nor must a circumstance be omitted,
                  which here renders the close of spring especially interesting; I mean the practice
                  of bringing down the ewes from the mountains to <a class="colorbox-node" href="n138.html">yean</a> in the vallies and enclosed grounds. The herbage being thus cropped as it springs,
                  <em>that</em> first tender emerald green of the season, which would otherwise have lasted little
                  more than a fortnight, is prolonged in the pastures and meadows for many weeks: while
                  they are farther enlivened by the multitude of lambs bleating and skipping about.
                  These sportive creatures, as they gather strength, are turned out upon the open mountains,
                  and with their slender limbs, their snow-white colour, and their wild and light motions,
                  beautifully accord or contrast with the rocks and lawns, upon which they must now
                  begin to seek their food. And last, but not least, at this time the traveller <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1914">[Page]</span> will be sure of room and comfortable accommodation, even in the smaller inns. I am
                  aware that few of those who may be inclined to profit by this recommendation will
                  be able to do so, as the time and manner of an excursion of this kind are mostly regulated
                  by circumstances which prevent an entire freedom of choice. It will therefore be more
                  pleasant to observe, that, though the months of July and August are liable to many
                  objections, yet it often happens that the weather, at this time, is not more wet and
                  stormy than they, who are really capable of enjoying the sublime forms of nature in
                  their utmost sublimity, would desire. For no traveller, provided he be in good health,
                  and with any command of time, would have a just privilege to visit such scenes, if
                  he could grudge the price of a little confinement among them, or interruption in his
                  journey, for the sight or sound of a storm coming on or clearing away. Insensible
                  must he be who would not congratulate himself upon the bold bursts of sunshine, the
                  descending vapours, wandering lights and shadows, and the invigorated torrents and
                  water-falls, with which broken weather, in a mountainous region, is accompanied. At
                  such a time there is no cause to complain, either of the monotony of midsummer colouring,
                  or the glaring atmosphere of long, cloudless, and hot days.

                  <p>Thus far concerning the respective advantages and disadvantages of the different seasons

                     grounds, and expanding itself till its receptacle is filled to the brim,—it follows,
                     that it will appear to most advantage when approached from its outlet, especially
                     if the lake be in a mountainous country; for, by this way of approach, the traveller
                     faces the grander features of the scene, and is gradually conducted into its most
                     sublime recesses. Now, every one knows, that from amenity and beauty the transition
                     to sublimity is easy and favourable; but the reverse is not so; for, after the faculties
                     have been elevated, they are indisposed to humbler excitement.

                  or the visitant remain there until the time of sun-set, and afterwards. The precipitous
                  sides of the mountain, and the neighbouring summits, may <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1927">[Page]</span> be seen with effect under any atmosphere which allows them to be seen at all; but
                  <em>he</em> is the most fortunate adventurer, who chances to be involved in vapours which open

               <p>A stranger to a mountainous country may not be aware that his walk in the early morning
                  ought to be taken on the eastern side of the vale, otherwise he will lose the morning
                  light, first touching the tops and thence creeping down the sides of the opposite
                  hills, as the sun ascends, or he may go to some central eminence, commanding both
                  the shadows from the eastern, and the lights upon the western mountains. But, if the
                  horizon line in the east be low, the western side may be taken for the sake of the
                  reflections, upon the water, of light from the rising sun. In the evening, for like
                  reasons, the contrary course should be taken.

                  or profit, must principally depend.—May I be allowed a few words on this subject?
               </p>
               <p>Nothing is more injurious to genuine feeling than the practice of hastily and ungraciously
                  depreciating the face of one country by comparing it with that of another. True it
                  is <a class="colorbox-node" href="n139.html">Qui <em>bene</em> distinguit bene <em>docet</em></a>; yet fastidiousness is a wretched travelling companion; and the best guide to which,
                  in matters of taste we can en<span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1950">[Page]</span>trust ourselves, is a disposition to be pleased. For example, if a traveller be among
                  the Alps, let him surrender up his mind to the fury of the gigantic torrents, and
                  take delight in the contemplation of their almost irresistible violence, without complaining
                  of the monotony of their foaming course, or being disgusted with the muddiness of
                  the water—apparent even where it is violently agitated. In Cumberland and Westmorland,
                  let not the comparative weakness of the streams prevent him from sympathising with
                  such impetuosity as they possess; and, making the most of the present objects, let
                  him, as he justly may do, observe with admiration the unrivalled brilliancy of the
                  water, and that variety of motion, mood, and character, that arises out of the want
                  of those resources by which the power of the streams in the Alps is supported.— Again,
                  with respect to the mountains; though these are comparatively of diminutive size,
                  though there is little of perpetual snow, and no voice of summer-avalanches is heard
                  among them; and though traces left by the ravage of the elements are here comparatively
                  rare and unimpressive, yet out of this very deficiency proceeds a sense of stability
                  and permanence that is, to many minds, more grateful— <span class="quote">‘"<a class="colorbox-node" href="n140.html">While the coarse rushes to the sweeping<br/> breeze Sigh forth their ancient melodies</a>."’</span> Among the Alps are few places that do not preclude this feeling of tranquil sublimity.
                  <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1960">[Page]</span> Havoc, and ruin, and desolation, and encroachment, are everywhere more or less obtruded;
                  and it is difficult, notwithstanding the naked loftiness of the <em>pikes</em>, and the snow-capped summits of the <em>mounts</em>, to escape from the depressing sensation, that the whole are in a rapid process of
                  dissolution; and, were it not that the destructive agency must abate as the heights
                  diminish, would, in time to come, be levelled with the plains. Nevertheless, I would
                  relish to the utmost the demonstrations of every species of power at work to effect
                  such changes.
               </p>
               <p>From these general views let us descend a moment to detail. A stranger to mountain
                  imagery naturally on his first arrival looks out for sublimity in every object that
                  admits of it; and is almost always disappointed. For this disappointment there exists,
                  I believe, no general preventive; nor is it desirable that there should. But with
                  regard to one class of objects, there is a point in which injurious expectations may
                  be easily corrected. It is generally supposed that waterfalls are scarcely worth being
                  looked at except after much rain, and that, the more swollen the stream, the more
                  fortunate the spectator; but this however is true only of large cataracts with sublime
                  accompaniments; and not even of these without some drawbacks. In other instances,
                  what becomes, at such a time, of that sense of refreshing coolness which can only
                  be felt in dry and sunny weather, when the rocks, herbs, <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1971">[Page]</span> and flowers glisten with moisture diffused by the breath of the precipitous water?
                  But, considering these things as objects of sight only, it may be observed that the
                  principal charm of the smaller waterfalls or cascades consists in certain proportions
                  of form and affinities of colour, among the component parts of the scene; and in the
                  contrast maintained between the falling water and that which is apparently at rest,
                  or rather settling gradually into quiet in the pool below. The beauty of such a scene,
                  where there is naturally so much agitation, is also heightened, in a peculiar manner,
                  by the <em>glimmering</em>, and, towards the verge of the pool, by the <em>steady</em>, reflection of the surrounding images. Now, all those delicate distinctions are destroyed
                  by heavy floods, and the whole stream rushes along in foam and tumultuous confusion.
                  A happy proportion of component parts is indeed noticeable among the landscapes of
                  the North of England; and, in this characteristic essential to a perfect picture,
                  they surpass the scenes of Scotland, and, in a still greater degree, those of Switzerland.
               </p>
               <p>As a resident among the Lakes, I frequently hear the scenery of this country compared
                  with that of the Alps; and therefore a few words shall be added to what has been incidentally
                  said upon that subject. 
               </p>
               <p>If we could recall, to this region of lakes, the native pine-forests, with which many
                  hundred years ago a large portion of the heights <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1983">[Page]</span> was covered, then, during spring and autumn, it might frequently, with much propriety,
                  be compared to Switzerland,—the elements of the landscape would be the same—one country
                  representing the other in miniature. Towns, villages, churches, rural seats, bridges
                  and roads: green meadows and arable grounds, with their various produce, and deciduous
                  woods of diversified foliage which occupy the vales and lower regions of the mountains,
                  would, as in Switzerland, be divided by dark forests from ridges and round-topped
                  heights covered with snow, and from pikes and sharp declivities imperfectly arrayed
                  in the same glittering mantle: and the resemblance would be still more perfect on
                  those days when vapours, resting upon, and floating around the summits, leave the
                  elevation of the mountains less dependent upon the eye than on the imagination. But
                  the pine-forests have wholly disappeared; and only during late spring and early autumn
                  is realized here that assemblage of the imagery of different seasons, which is exhibited
                  through the whole summer among the Alps,—winter in the distance, —and warmth, leafy
                  woods, verdure and fertility at hand, and widely diffused.
               </p>
               <p>Striking, then, from among the permanent materials of the landscape, that stage of
                  vegetation which is occupied by pine-forests, and, above that, the perennial snows,
                  we have mountains, the highest of which little exceed 3000 feet, <a class="colorbox-node" href="n141.html">while some of the Alps do not fall <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e1993">[Page]</span> short of 14,000 or 15,000</a>, and 8,000 or 10,000 is not an uncommon elevation. Our tracts of wood and water are
                  almost as diminutive in comparison; therefore, as far as sublimity is dependent upon
                  absolute bulk and height, and atmospherical influences in connection with these, it
                  is obvious, that there can be no rivalship. But a short residence among the British
                  Mountains will furnish abundant proof, that, after a certain point of elevation, viz.
                  that which allows of compact and fleecy clouds settling upon, or sweeping over, the
                  summits, the sense of sublimity depends more upon form and relation of objects to
                  each other than upon their actual magnitude; and, that an elevation of 3000 feet is
                  sufficient to call forth in a most impressive degree the creative, and magnifying,
                  and softening powers of the atmosphere. Hence, on the score even of sublimity, the
                  superiority of the Alps is by no means so great as might hastily be inferred;—and,
                  as to the <em>beauty</em> of the lower regions of the Swiss Mountains, it is noticeable—that, as they are all
                  regularly mown, their surface has nothing of that mellow tone and variety of hues
                  by which mountain turf, that is never touched by the scythe, is distinguished. On
                  the smooth and steep slopes of the Swiss hills, these plots of verdure do indeed agreeably
                  unite their colour with that of the deciduous trees, or make a lively contrast with
                  the dark green pine-groves that define them, and among which they run in endless variety
                  of shapes <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2014">[Page]</span> —but this is most pleasing <em>at first sight;</em> the permanent gratification of the eye requires finer gradations of tone, and a more
                  delicate blending of hues into each other. Besides, it is only in spring and late
                  autumn that cattle animate by their presence the Swiss lawns; and, though the pastures
                  of the higher regions where they feed during the summer are left in their natural
                  state of flowery herbage, those pastures are so remote, that their texture and colour
                  are of no consequence in the composition of any picture in which a lake of the Vales
                  is a feature. Yet in those lofty regions, how vegetation is invigorated by the genial
                  climate of that country! Among the luxuriant flowers there met with, groves, or forests,
                  if I may so call them, of Monks-hood are frequently seen; the plant of deep, rich
                  blue, and as tall as in our gardens; and this at an elevation where, in Cumberland,
                  Icelandic moss would only be found, or the stony summits be utterly bare.
               </p>
               <p>We have, then, for the colouring of Switzerland, <em>principally</em> a vivid green herbage, black woods, and dazzling snows, presented in masses with
                  a grandeur to which no one can be insensible; but not often graduated by Nature into
                  soothing harmony, and so ill suited to the pencil, that though abundance of good subjects
                  may be there found, they are not such as can be deemed <em>characteristic</em> of the country; nor is this unfitness confined to colour: the forms of the mountains,
                  though <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2027">[Page]</span> many of them in some points of view the noblest that can be conceived, are apt to
                  run into spikes and needles, and present a jagged outline which has a mean effect,
                  transferred to canvass. This must have been felt by the ancient masters; for, if I
                  am not mistaken, they have not left a single landscape, the materials of which are
                  taken from the <em>peculiar</em> features of the Alps; <a class="colorbox-node" href="n142.html">yet Titian passed his life almost in their neighbourhood; the Poussins and Claude
                     must have been well acquainted with their aspects; and several admirable painters,
                     as Tibaldi and Luino, were born among the Italian Alps</a>. A few experiments have lately been made by <a class="colorbox-node" href="n143.html">Englishmen</a>, but they only prove that courage, skill, and judgment, may surmount any obstacles;
                  and it may be safely affirmed, that they who have done best in this bold adventure,
                  will be the least likely to repeat the attempt. But, though our scenes are better
                  suited to painting than those of the Alps, I should be sorry to contemplate either
                  country in reference to that art, further than as its fitness or unfitness for the
                  pencil renders it more or less pleasing to the eye of the spectator, who has learned
                  to observe and feel, chiefly from Nature herself.

                     if left to themselves. Magnificent walnut trees grow upon the plains of Switzerland;
                     and fine trees, of that species, are found scattered over the hill-sides: birches
                     also grow here and there in luxuriant beauty; but neither these, nor oaks, are ever
                     a prevailing tree, nor can even be said to be common; and the oaks, as far as I had
                     an opportunity of observing, are greatly inferior to those of Britain. Among the interior
                     vallies the proportion of beeches and pines is so great that other trees are scarcely
                     noticeable; and surely such woods are at all seasons much less agreeable than that
                     rich and harmonious distribution of oak, ash, elm, birch, and alder, that formerly
                     clothed the sides of Snowdon and Helvellyn; and of which no mean remains still survive
                     at the head of Ulswater. On the Italian side of the Alps, chesnut and walnut trees
                     grow at a considerable height on the mountains; but, even there, the foliage is not
                     equal in beauty to the "natural product" of this climate. In fact the sunshine of
                     the South of Europe, so envied when heard of at a distance, is in many respects injurious
                     to rural beauty, particularly as it incites to the cultivation of spots of ground
                     which in colder climates would be left in the hands of nature, favouring at the same
                     time the culture of <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2050">[Page]</span> plants that are more valuable on account of the fruit they produce to gratify the
                     palate, than for affording pleasure to the eye, as materials of landscape. Take, for

                     with olive trees, accords but ill with the vastness of the green unappropriated mountains,

                     at the expense of truth, I am not afraid of asserting that in many points of view
                     our LAKES, also, are much more interesting than those of the Alps; first, as is implied
                     above, from being more happily proportioned to the other features of the landscape;
                     and next, both as being infinitely more pellucid, and less subject to agitation from
                     the winds.

                              troubled by storms in summer than in winter. Hence the propriety of the following
                              verses. "Lari! margine ubique confragosoNulli coelicolum negas sacellumPicto pariete

                     </div>Como, (which may <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2126">[Page]</span> perhaps be styled the King of Lakes, as Lugano is certainly the Queen) is disturbed
                     by a periodical wind blowing <em>from</em> the head in the morning, and <em>towards</em> it in the after noon. The magnificent Lake of the four Cantons, especially its noblest
                     division, called the Lake of Uri, is not only much agitated by winds, but in the night
                     time is disturbed from the bottom, as I was told, and indeed as I witnessed, without
                     any apparent commotion in the air; and when at rest, the water is not pure to the
                     eye, but of a heavy green hue—as is that of all the other lakes, apparently according
                     to the degree in which they are fed by melted snows. If the Lake of Geneva furnish
                     an exception, this is probably owing to its vast extent, which allows the water to
                     deposit its impurities. The water of the English lakes, on the contrary, being of
                     a crystalline clearness, the reflections of the surrounding hills are frequently so
                     lively, that it is scarcely possible to distinguish the point where the real object
                     terminates, and its un substantial duplicate begins. The lower part of the Lake of
                     Geneva, from its narrowness, must be much less subject to agitation than the higher
                     divisions, and, as the water is clearer than that of the other Swiss Lakes, it will
                     frequently exhibit this appearance, though it is scarcely possible in an equal degree.
                     During <a class="colorbox-node" href="n150.html">two comprehensive tours</a> among the Alps, I did not observe, except on one of the smaller lakes, between Lugano
                     and Ponte Tresa, a single instance of those beautiful repetitions <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2138">[Page]</span> of surrounding objects on the bosom of the water, which are so frequently seen here:
                     not to speak of the fine dazzling trembling network, breezy motions, and streaks and
                     circles of intermingled smooth and rippled water, which makes the surface of our lakes
                     a field of endless variety. But among the Alps, where every thing tends to the grand
                     and the sublime, in surfaces as well as in forms, if the lakes do not court the placid
                     reflections of land objects those of first-rate magnitude make compensation, in some
                     degree, by exhibiting those ever-changing fields of green, blue, and purple shadows
                     or lights, (one scarcely knows which to name them) that call to mind a sea-prospect
                     contemplated from a lofty cliff.

               <p>The subject of torrents and water-falls has already been touched upon; but it may
                  be added that in Switzerland, the perpetual accompaniment of snow upon the higher
                  regions takes much from the effect of foaming white streams; while, from their frequency,
                  they obstruct each other's influence upon the mind of the spectator; and, in all cases,
                  the effect of an individual cataract, excepting <a class="colorbox-node" href="n151.html">the great Fall of the Rhine at Schaffhausen</a>, is diminished by the general fury of the stream of which it is a part.
               </p>
               <p>Recurring to the reflections from still water, I will describe a singular phenomenon
                  of this kind of which I was an eye-witness. 
               </p>
               <p>Walking by the side of Ulswater upon a calm September morning, I saw, deep within
                  <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2149">[Page]</span> the bosom of the lake, a magnificent Castle, with towers and battlements, nothing
                  could be more distinct than the whole edifice;—after gazing with delight upon it for
                  some time, as upon a work of enchantment, I could not but regret that my previous
                  knowledge of the place enabled me to account for the appearance. It was in fact the
                  reflection of a pleasure-house called <a class="colorbox-node" href="n152.html">Lyulph's Tower</a>—the towers and battlements magnified and so much changed in shape as not to be immediately
                  recognized. In the meanwhile, the pleasure-house itself was altogether hidden from
                  my view by a body of vapour stretching over it and along the hill-side on which it
                  stands, but not so as to have intercepted its communication with the lake; and hence
                  this novel and most impressive object, which, if I had been a stranger to the spot,
                  would, from its being inexplicable, have long detained the mind in a state of pleasing
                  astonishment.
               </p>
               <p>Appearances of this kind, acting upon the credulity of early ages, may have given
                  birth to, and favoured the belief in, stories of subaqueous palaces, gardens, and
                  pleasure-grounds—the brilliant ornaments of Romance. 
               </p>
               <p>With this <em>inverted</em> scene I will couple a much more extraordinary phenomenon, which will show how other
                  elegant fancies may have had their origin, less in invention than in the actual processes
                  of nature.
               </p>
               <p>About eleven o'clock on the forenoon of a winter's day, coming suddenly, in company
                  of <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2163">[Page]</span> a friend, into view of the Lake of Grasmere, we were alarmed by the sight of a newly-created
                  Island; the transitory thought of the moment was, that it had been produced by an
                  earthquake or some other convulsion of nature. Recovering from the alarm, which was
                  greater than the reader can possibly sympathize with, but which was shared to its
                  full extent by my companion, we proceeded to examine the object before us. The elevation
                  of this new island exceeded considerably that of the old one, its neighbour; it was
                  likewise larger in circumference, comprehending a space of about five acres; its surface
                  rocky, speckled with snow, and sprinkled over with birch trees; it was divided towards
                  the south from the other island by a narrow frith, and in like manner from the northern
                  shore of the lake; on the east and west it was separated from the shore by a much
                  larger space of smooth water.
               </p>
               <p>Marvellous was the illusion! Comparing the new with the old Island, the surface of
                  which is soft, green, and unvaried, I do not scruple to say that, as an object of
                  sight, it was much the more distinct. "How little faith," we exclaimed, "is due to
                  one sense, unless its evidence be confirmed by some of its fellows! What Stranger
                  could possibly be persuaded that this, which we know to be an unsubstantial mockery,
                  is <em>really</em> so; and that there exists only a single Island on this beautiful Lake?" At length
                  the appearance underwent a gradual transmutation; it lost its prominence and pass<span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2172">[Page]</span>ed into a glimmering and dim <em>inversion</em>, and then totally disappeared;—leaving behind it a clear open area of ice of the
                  same dimensions. We now perceived that this bed of ice, which was thinly suffused
                  with water, had produced the illusion, by reflecting and refracting (as persons skilled
                  in optics would no doubt easily explain) a rocky and woody section of the opposite
                  mountain named Silver-how.
               </p>
               <p>Having dwelt so much upon the beauty of pure and still water, and pointed out the
                  advantage which the Lakes of the North of England have in this particular over those
                  of the Alps, it would be injustice not to advert to the sublimity that must often
                  be given to Alpine scenes, by the agitations to which those vast bodies of diffused
                  water are there subject. I have witnessed many tremendous thunder-storms among the
                  Alps, and the most glorious effects of light and shadow; but I never happened to be
                  present when any Lake was agitated by those hurricanes which I imagine must often
                  torment them. If the commotions be at all proportionable to the expanse and depth
                  of the waters, and the height of the surrounding mountains, then, if I may judge from
                  what is frequently seen here, the exhibition must be awful and astonishing.—On this
                  day, <span class="date">March 30, 1822</span>, the winds have been acting upon the small Lake of Rydal, as if they had received
                  command to carry its waters from their bed into the sky; the white billows in different
                  quarters disappeared under clouds, or rather <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2182">[Page]</span> drifts, of spray, that were whirled along, and up into the air by scouring winds,
                  charging each other in squadrons in every direction, upon the Lake. The spray, having
                  been hurried aloft till it lost its consistency and whiteness, was driven along the
                  mountain tops like flying showers that vanish in the distance. Frequently an eddying
                  wind scooped the waters out of the basin, and forced them upwards in the very shape
                  of an Icelandic Geyser, or boiling fountain, to the height of several hundred feet.
               </p>
               <p>This small Mere of Rydal, from its position, is subject in a peculiar degree to these
                  commotions. The present season, however, is unusually stormy;— great numbers of fish,
                  two of them not less than 12 pounds weight, were a few days ago cast on the shores
                  of Derwent-water by the force of the waves.

                  my native mountains, I will support my general opinion by the authority of Mr. West,
                  whose Guide to the Lakes has been eminently serviceable to the Tourist for nearly
                  50 years. The Author, a Roman Catholic clergyman, had passed much time abroad, and
                  was well acquainted with the scenery of the Continent. He thus expresses himself:
                  "They who intend to make the continental tour should begin here; as it will give,
                  in miniature, an idea of what they are to meet with there, in traversing the Alps
                  and Appenines; to which our northern <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2195">[Page]</span> mountains are not inferior in beauty of line, or variety of summit, number of lakes,
                  and transparency of water; not in colouring of rock, or softness of turf; but in height
                  and extent only. The mountains here are all accessible to the summit, and furnish
                  prospects no less surprising, and with more variety, than the Alps themselves. The
                  tops of the highest Alps are inaccessible, being covered with everlasting snow, which
                  commencing at regular heights above the cultivated tracts, or wooded and verdant sides,
                  form indeed the highest contrast in nature. For there may be seen all the variety
                  of climate in one view. To this, however, we oppose the sight of the ocean, from the
                  summits of all the higher mountains, as it appears intersected with promontaries,
                  decorated with islands, and animated with navigation."—West's <em>Guide</em>, p. 5.

               <p>It was my intention, several years ago, to describe a regular tour through this country,
                  taking the different scenes in the most favour<span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2220">[Page]</span>able order; but after some progress had been made in <a class="colorbox-node" href="n153.html">the work</a> it was abandoned from a conviction, that, if well executed, it would lessen the pleasure

               </p>
               <p>Having left Rosthwaite in Borrowdale, on a bright morning in the first week of October,
                  we ascended from <a class="colorbox-node" href="n155.html">Seathwaite</a> to the top of the ridge, called Ash-course, and thence beheld three distinct views—on
                  one side, the continuous Vale of Borrowdale, Keswick, and Bassenthwaite,—with Skiddaw,
                  Helvellyn, Saddle-back, and numerous other mountains, —and, in the distance, the Solway
                  Frith and the Mountains of Scotland;—on the other side, and below us, the Langdale
                  Pikes—their own vale below <em>them</em>;— Windermere,—and, far beyond Windermere, Ingleborough in Yorkshire. But how shall
                  I speak of the deliciousness of the third prospect! At this time, <em>that</em> was most favoured by sunshine and shade. The green Vale of Esk—deep and green, with
                  its glittering serpent stream, lay below us; and, on we looked to the Mountains near
                  the Sea,—Black Comb pre-eminent,—and, still <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2239">[Page]</span> beyond, to the Sea itself, in dazzling brightness. Turning round we saw the Mountains
                  of Wastdale in tumult; to our right, Great Gavel, the loftiest, a distinct, and <em>huge</em> form, though the middle of the mountain was, to our eyes, as its base.
               </p>
               <p>We had attained <a class="colorbox-node" href="n156.html">the object of this journey</a>; but our ambition now mounted higher. We saw the summit of Scaw-fell, apparently
                  very near to us; and we shaped our course towards it; but, discovering that it could
                  not be reached without first making a considerable descent, we resolved, instead,
                  to aim at another point of the same mountain, called <a class="colorbox-node" href="n157.html">the <em>Pikes</em></a>, which I have since found has been estimated as higher than the summit bearing the
                  name of Scawfell Head, where <a class="colorbox-node" href="n158.html">the Stone Man</a> is built.
               </p>
               <p>The sun had never once been overshadowed by a cloud during the whole of our progress
                  from the centre of Borrowdale. On the summit of the Pike, which we gained after much
                  toil, though without difficulty, there was not a breath of air to stir even the papers
                  containing our refreshment, as they lay spread out upon a rock. The stillness seemed
                  to be not of this world:—we paused, and kept silence to listen; and no sound could
                  be heard: the Scawfell Cataracts were voiceless to us; and there was not an insect
                  to hum in the air. The vales which we had seen from Ash-course lay yet in view; and,
                  side by side with Eskdale, we now saw the sister Vale of Donnerdale terminated by
                  the Duddon Sands. But <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2259">[Page]</span> the majesty of the mountains below, and close to us, is not to be conceived. We now
                  beheld the whole mass of <a class="colorbox-node" href="n159.html">Great Gavel</a> from its base,—the Den of Wastdale at our feet—a gulph immeasurable: Grasmire and
                  the other mountains of Crummock—Ennerdale and its mountains; and the Sea beyond! We
                  sat down to our repast, and gladly would we have tempered our beverage (for there
                  was no spring or well near us) with such a supply of delicious water as we might have
                  procured, had we been on the rival summit of Great Gavel; for on its highest point
                  is a small triangular receptacle in the native rock, which, the shepherds say, is
                  never dry. There we might have slaked our thirst plenteously with a pure and celestial
                  liquid, for the cup or basin, it appears, has no other feeder than the dews of heaven,
                  the showers, the vapours, the hoar frost, and the spotless snow.
               </p>
               <p>While we were gazing around, "Look," I exclaimed, "at yon ship upon the glittering
                  sea!" "Is it a ship?" replied our shepherd-guide. "It can be nothing else," interposed
                  my companion; "I cannot be mistaken, I am so accustomed to the appearance of ships
                  at sea." The Guide dropped the argument; but, before a minute was gone, he quietly
                  said, "Now look at your ship; it is changed into a horse." So indeed it was,—a horse
                  with a gallant neck and head. We laughed heartily; and, I hope, when again inclined
                  to be positive, I may remember the ship and the <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2266">[Page]</span> horse upon the glittering sea; and the calm confidence, yet submissiveness, of our
                  wise Man of the Mountains, who certainly had more knowledge of clouds than we, whatever
                  might be our knowledge of ships.
               </p>
               <p>I know not how long we might have remained on the summit of the Pike, without a thought
                  of moving, had not our Guide warned us that we must not linger; for a storm was coming.
                  We looked in vain to espy the signs of it. Mountains, vales, and sea were touched
                  with the clear light of the sun. "It is there," said he, pointing to the sea beyond
                  Whitehaven, and there we perceived a light vapour unnoticeable but by a shepherd accustomed
                  to watch all mountain bodings. We gazed around again, and yet again, unwilling to
                  lose the remembrance of what lay before us in that lofty solitude; and then prepared
                  to depart. Meanwhile the air changed to cold, and we saw that <a class="colorbox-node" href="n160.html">tiny vapour swelled into mighty masses of cloud</a> which came boiling over the mountains. Great Gavel, Helvellyn, and Skiddaw, were
                  wrapped in storm; yet Langdale, and the mountains in that quarter, remained all bright
                  in sunshine. Soon the storm reached us; we sheltered under a crag; and almost as rapidly
                  as it had come it passed away, and left us free to observe the struggles of gloom
                  and sunshine in other quarters. Langdale now had its share, and the Pikes of Langdale
                  were decorated by two splendid rainbows. Skiddaw also had his own rainbows. Before
                  we <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2273">[Page]</span> again reached Ash-course every cloud had vanished from every summit.
               </p>
               <p>I ought to have mentioned that round the top of Scawfell-PIKE not a blade of grass
                  is to be seen. Cushions or tufts of moss, parched and brown, appear between the <a class="colorbox-node" href="n161.html">huge blocks and stones that lie in heaps</a> on all sides to a great distance, like skeletons or bones of the earth not needed
                  at the creation, and there left to be covered with <a class="colorbox-node" href="n162.html">never-dying lichens</a>, which the clouds and dews nourish; and adorn with colours of vivid and exquisite
                  beauty. Flowers, the most brilliant feathers, and even gems, scarcely surpass in colouring
                  some of those masses of stone, which no human eye beholds, except the shepherd or
                  traveller be led thither by curiosity: and how seldom must this happen! For the other
                  eminence is the one visited by the adventurous stranger; and the shepherd has no inducement
                  to ascend the PIKE in quest of his sheep; no food being <em>there</em> to tempt them.
               </p>
               <p>We certainly were singularly favoured in the weather; for when we were seated on the
                  summit, our conductor, turning his eyes thoughtfully round, said, "I do not know that
                  in my whole life, I was ever, at any season of the year, so high upon the mountains
                  on so <em>calm</em> a day." (It was the <span class="date">7th of October</span>.) Afterwards we had a spectacle of the grandeur of earth and heaven commingled; yet
                  without terror. We knew that the storm would pass away;—for so our prophetic Guide
                  had assured us.<span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2294">[Page]</span></p>
               <p>Before we reached Seathwaite in Borrowdale, a few stars had appeared, and we pursued
                  our way down the Vale, to Rosthwaite, by moonlight. 
               </p>
               <p>Scawfell and Helvellyn being the two Mountains of this region which will best repay

               <p>Having said so much of <em>points of view</em> to which few are likely to ascend, I am induced to subjoin an account of a short
                  excursion through more accessible parts of the country, made at a <em>time</em> when it is seldom seen but by the inhabitants. As <a class="colorbox-node" href="n166.html">the journal was written for one acquainted with the general features of the country</a>, only those effects and appearances are dwelt upon, which are produced by the changeableness
                  of the atmosphere, or belong to the season when the excursion was made.
               </p>
               <p><span class="date">A.D. 1805</span>.——On the <span class="date">7th of November</span>, on a damp and gloomy morning, we left Grasmere Vale, intending to pass a few days
                  on the banks of Ullswater. A mild and dry autumn had <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2422">[Page]</span> been unusually favourable to the preservation and beauty of foliage; and, far advanced
                  as the season was, the trees on the larger Island of Rydal-mere retained a splendour
                  which did not need the heightening of sunshine. We noticed, as we passed, that the
                  line of the grey rocky shore of that island, shaggy with variegated bushes and shrubs,
                  and spotted and striped with purplish brown heath, indistinguishably blending with
                  its image reflected in the still water, produced a curious resemblance, both in form
                  and colour, to a richly-coated caterpillar, as it might appear through a magnifying
                  glass of extraordinary power. The mists gathered as we went along: but, when we reached
                  the top of Kirkstone, we were glad we had not been discouraged by the apprehension
                  of bad weather. Though not able to see a hundred yards before us, we were more than
                  contented. At such a time, and in such a place, every scattered stone the size of
                  one's head becomes a companion. Near the top of the Pass is the remnant of an old
                  wall, which (magnified, though obscured, by the vapour) might have been taken for
                  a fragment of some monument of ancient grandeur,—yet that same pile of stones we had
                  never before even observed. This situation, it must be allowed, is not favourable
                  to gaiety; but a pleasing hurry of spirits accompanies the surprise occasioned by
                  objects transformed, dilated, or distorted, as they are when seen through such a medium.
                  Many of the fragments of rock on <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2424">[Page]</span> the top and slopes of Kirkstone, and of similar places, are fantastic enough in themselves;
                  but the full effect of such impressions can only be had in a state of weather when
                  they are not likely to be <em>sought</em> for. It was not till we had descended considerably that the fields of Hartshope were
                  seen, like a lake tinged by the reflection of sunny clouds: I mistook them for Brothers-water,
                  but, soon after, we saw that Lake gleaming faintly with a steelly brightness,—then,
                  as we continued to descend, appeared the brown oaks, and the birches of lively yellow—and
                  the cottages—and the lowly <a class="colorbox-node" href="n167.html">Hall of Hartshope</a>, with its long roof and ancient chimneys. During great part of our way to Patterdale,
                  we had rain, or rather drizzling vapour; for there was never a drop upon our hair
                  or clothes larger than the smallest pearls upon a lady's ring.
               </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The following morning, incessant rain till 11 o'clock, when the sky began to clear, and we walked along the eastern shore of Ullswater
                     towards the farm of Blowick. The wind blew strong, and drove the clouds forward, on
                     the side of the mountain above our heads;—two storm-stiffened black yew-trees fixed
                     our notice, seen through, or under the edge of, the flying mists,—four or five goats
                     were bounding among the rocks;—the sheep moved about more quietly, or cowered beneath
                     their sheltering places. This is the only part of the country where goats are now
                     found;

                              (19)

                     </div> but this <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2442">[Page]</span> morning, before we had seen these, I was reminded of that picturesque animal by two
                     rams of mountain breed, both with <a class="colorbox-node" href="n168.html">Ammonian horns</a>, and with <a class="colorbox-node" href="n169.html">beards majestic as that which Michael Angelo has given to his statue of Moses</a>.—But to return; when our path had brought us to that part of the naked common which
                     overlooks the woods and bush-besprinkled fields of Blowick, the lake, clouds, and
                     mists were all in motion to the sound of sweeping winds; —the church and cottages
                     of Patterdale scarcely visible, or seen only by fits between the shifting vapours.
                     To the northward the scene was less visionary;—Place Fell steady and bold;—the whole
                     lake driving onward like a great river—waves dancing round the small islands. The
                     house at Blowick was the boundary of our walk; and we returned, lamenting to see a
                     decaying and uncomfortable dwelling in a place where sublimity and beauty seemed to
                     contend with each other. But these regrets were dispelled by a glance on the woods
                     that clothe the opposite steeps of the lake. How exquisite was the mixture of sober
                     and splendid hues! The general colouring of the trees was brown—rather that of ripe
                     hazel nuts; but towards the water, there were yet beds of green, and in the highest
                     parts of the wood, was abundance of yellow foliage, which, gleaming through a vapoury
                     lustre, reminded us of masses of clouds, as you see them gathered together in the
                     west, and touched with the golden light of the setting sun. <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2451">[Page]</span></p>
               </div>
               <p>After dinner we walked up the Vale: I had never had an idea of its extent and width
                  in passing along the public road on the other side. We followed the path that leads
                  from house to house; two or three times it took us through some of those copses or
                  groves that cover the little hillocks in the middle of the vale, making an intricate
                  and pleasing intermixture of lawn and wood. Our fancies could not resist the temptation;
                  and <a class="colorbox-node" href="n170.html">we fixed upon a spot for a cottage</a>, which we began to build: and finished as easily as castles are raised in the air.—Visited
                  the same spot in the evening. I shall say nothing of the moonlight aspect of the situation
                  which had charmed us so much in the afternoon; but I wish you had been with us when,
                  in returning to <a class="colorbox-node" href="n171.html">our friend's house</a>, we espied his lady's large white dog, lying in the moonshine upon the round knoll
                  under the old yew-tree in the garden, a romantic image—the dark tree and its dark
                  shadow—and the elegant creature, as fair as a spirit! The torrents murmured softly:
                  the mountains down which they were falling did not, to my sight furnish a back-ground
                  for this Ossianic picture; but I had a consciousness of the depth of the seclusion,
                  and that mountains were embracing us on all sides; "<a class="colorbox-node" href="n172.html">I saw not, but I <em>felt</em> that they were there</a>."
               </p>
               <p><span class="date">Friday, November 9th</span>.——Rain, as yesterday, till 10 o'clock, when we took a boat to row down the lake.
                  The day improved,—clouds and sunny gleams on the mountains. In the <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2473">[Page]</span> large bay under Place Fell, three fishermen were dragging a net,—a picturesque group
                  beneath the high and bare crags! A raven was seen aloft; not hovering like the kite,
                  for that is not the habit of the bird; but passing on with a straight-forward perseverance,
                  and timing the motion of its wings to its own croaking. The waters were agitated;
                  and the iron tone of the raven's voice, which strikes upon the ear at all times as
                  the more dolorous from its regularity, was in fine keeping with the wild scene before
                  our eyes. This carnivorous fowl is a great enemy to the lambs of these solitudes;
                  I recollect frequently seeing, when a boy, bunches of unfledged ravens suspended from
                  the churchyard gates of <a class="colorbox-node" href="n173.html">H ----------</a>, for which <a class="colorbox-node" href="n174.html">a reward of <em>so</em> much a head was given to the adventurous destroyer</a>.— The fishermen drew their net ashore, and hundreds of fish were leaping in their
                  prison. They were all of the kind called skellies, a sort of fresh-water herring,
                  shoals of which may sometimes be seen dimpling or rippling the surface of the lake
                  in calm weather. This species is not found, I believe, in any other of these lakes;
                  nor, as far as I know, is <a class="colorbox-node" href="n175.html">the chevin</a>, that <em>spiritless</em> fish, (though I am loth to call it so, for it was <a class="colorbox-node" href="n176.html">a prime favourite with Isaac Walton</a>,) which must frequent Ullswater, as I have seen a large shoal passing into the lake
                  from the river Eamont. <em>Here</em> are no pike, and the char are smaller than those of the other lakes, and of inferior
                  quality; but the grey trout attains a very large size, sometimes weighing above twenty
                  pounds. <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2497">[Page]</span> This lordly creature seems to know that "<a class="colorbox-node" href="n177.html">retiredness is a piece of majesty</a>"; for it is scarcely ever caught, or even seen, except when it quits the depths of
                  the lake in the spawning season, and runs up into the streams, where it is too often
                  destroyed in disregard of the law of the land and of nature.
               </p>
               <p>Quitted the boat in the bay of Sandwyke, and pursued our way towards Martindale along
                  a pleasant path—at first through a coppice, bordering the lake, then through green
                  fields —and came to the village, (if village it may be called, for the houses are
                  few, and separated from each other,) a sequestered spot, shut out from the view of
                  the lake. Crossed <a class="colorbox-node" href="n178.html">the one-arched bridge</a>, below <a class="colorbox-node" href="n179.html">the chapel, with its "bare ring of mossy wall,"</a> and single yew-tree. At the last house in the dale we were greeted by the master,
                  who was sitting at his door, with a flock of sheep collected round him, for the purpose
                  of smearing them with tar (according to the custom of the season) for protection against
                  the winter's cold. He invited us to enter, and view a room built by <a class="colorbox-node" href="n180.html">Mr. Hasell</a> for the accommodation of his friends at the annual chase of red deer in his forests
                  at the head of these dales. The room is fitted up in the sportsman's style, with a
                  cupboard for bottles and glasses, with strong chairs, and a dining-table; and ornamented
                  with the horns of the stags caught at these hunts for a succession of years—the length
                  of the last race each had run being recorded under his spread<span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2514">[Page]</span>ing antlers. The good woman treated us with oaten cake, new and crisp; and after this
                  welcome refreshment and rest, we proceeded on our return to Patterdale by a short
                  cut over the mountains. On leaving the fields of Sandwyke, while ascending by a gentle
                  slope along the valley of Martindale, we had occasion to observe that in thinly-peopled
                  glens of this character the general want of wood gives a peculiar interest to the
                  scattered cottages embowered in sycamore. Towards its head, this valley splits into
                  two parts; and in one of these (that to the left) there is no house, nor any building
                  to be seen but a cattle-shed on the side of a hill, which is sprinkled over with trees,
                  evidently the remains of an extensive forest. Near the entrance of the other division
                  stands the house where we were entertained, and beyond the enclosures of that farm
                  there are no other. A few old trees remain, relics of the forest, a little stream
                  hastens, though with serpentine windings, through the uncultivated hollow, where many
                  cattle were pasturing. The cattle of this country are generally white, or light-coloured;
                  but these were dark brown, or black, which heightened the resemblance this scene bears
                  to many parts of the Highlands of Scotland.—While we paused to rest upon the hill-side,
                  though well contented with the quiet every-day sounds— the lowing of cattle, bleating
                  of sheep, and the very gentle murmuring of the valley stream, we could not but think
                  what a grand effect <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2516">[Page]</span> the music of the bugle-horn would have among these mountains. It is still heard once
                  every year, at the chase I have spoken of; a day of festivity for the inhabitants
                  of this district except the poor deer, the most ancient of them all. Our ascent even
                  to the top was very easy; when it was accomplished we had exceedingly fine views,
                  some of the lofty Fells being resplendent with sunshine, and others partly shrouded
                  by clouds. Ullswater, bordered by black steeps, was of dazzling brightness; the plain
                  beyond Penrith smooth and bright, or rather gleamy, as the sea or sea sands. Looked
                  down into Boardale, which, like Stybarrow, has been named from the wild swine that
                  formerly abounded here; but it has now no sylvan covert, being smooth and bare, a
                  long, narrow, deep, cradle-shaped glen, lying so sheltered that one would be pleased
                  to see it planted by human hands, there being a sufficiency of soil; and the trees
                  would be sheltered almost like shrubs in a green-house.— After having walked some
                  way along the top of the hill, came in view of Glenriddin and the mountains at the
                  head of Grisdale.—Before we began to descend, turned aside to <a class="colorbox-node" href="n181.html">a small ruin, called at this day the chapel</a>, where it is said the inhabitants of Martindale and Patterdale were accustomed to
                  assemble for worship. There are now no traces from which you could infer for what
                  use the building had been erected; the loose stones and the few which yet continue
                  piled up resemble those which lie <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2522">[Page]</span> elsewhere on the mountain; but the shape of the building having been oblong, its
                  remains differ from those of a common sheep-fold; and it has stood east and west.
                  Scarcely did the Druids, when they fled to these fastnesses perform their rites in
                  any situation more exposed to disturbance from the elements. One cannot pass by without
                  being reminded that the rustic psalmody must have had the accompaniment of many a
                  wildly-whistling blast; and what dismal storms must have often drowned the voice of
                  the preacher! As we descend, Patterdale opens upon the eye in grand simplicity, screened
                  by mountains, and proceeding from two heads, Deepdale and Hartshope, where lies the
                  little lake of Brotherswater, named in old maps Broaderwater, and probably rightly
                  so; for Bassenthwaite-mere at this day, is familiarly called Broadwater; but the change
                  in the appellation of this small lake or pool (if it be a corruption) may have been
                  assisted by some melancholy accident similar to <a class="colorbox-node" href="n182.html">what happened about twenty years ago</a>, when two brothers were drowned there, having gone out to take their holiday pleasure
                  upon the ice on a new-year's day.
               </p>
               <p>A rough and precipitous peat track brought us down to our friend's house.—Another
                  fine moonlight night; but a thick fog rising from the neighbouring river, enveloped
                  the rocky and wood-crested knoll on which our fancy-cottage had been erected; and,
                  under the damp cast upon my feelings, I consoled myself with <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2529">[Page]</span> moralising on the folly of hasty decisions in matters of importance, and the necessity
                  of having at least one year's knowledge of a place before you realise airy suggestions
                  in solid stone.
               </p>
               <p><span class="date">Saturday, November 10th.</span> At the breakfast-table tidings reached us of the death of Lord Nelson, and of <a class="colorbox-node" href="n183.html">the victory at Trafalgar</a>. Sequestered as we were from the sympathy of a crowd, we were shocked to hear that
                  the bells had been ringing joyously at Penrith to celebrate the triumph. In <a class="colorbox-node" href="n184.html">the rebellion of the year 1745</a>, people fled with their valuables from the open country to Patterdale, as a place
                  of refuge secure from the incursions of strangers. At that time, news such as we had
                  heard might have been long in penetrating so far into the recesses of the mountains;
                  but now, as you know, the approach is easy, and the communication, in summer time,
                  almost hourly: nor is this strange, for travellers after pleasure are become not less
                  active, and more numerous than those who formerly left their homes for purposes of
                  gain. The priest on the banks of the remotest stream of Lapland will talk familiarly
                  of Buonaparte's last conquests, and discuss the progress of the French revolution,
                  having acquired much of his information from adventurers impelled by curiosity alone.
               </p>
               <p>The morning was clear and cheerful after a night of sharp frost. At 10 o’clock we
                  took our way on foot towards Pooley Bridge, on the same side of the lake we had coasted
                  in a boat <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2543">[Page]</span> the day before.—Looked backwards to the south from our favourite station above Blowick.
                  The dazzling sunbeams striking upon the church and village, while the earth was steaming
                  with exhalations not traceable in other quarters, rendered their forms even more indistinct
                  than the partial and flitting veil of unillumined vapour had done two days before.
                  The grass on which we trod, and the trees in every thicket were dripping with melted
                  hoarfrost. We observed the lemon-coloured leaves of the birches, as the breeze turned
                  them to the sun, sparkle, or rather <em>flash</em>, like diamonds, and the leafless purple twigs were tipped with globes of shining
                  crystal.
               </p>
               <p>The day continued delightful, and unclouded to the end. I will not describe the country
                  which we slowly travelled through, nor relate our adventures: and will only add, that
                  on the afternoon of the 13th we returned along the banks of Ullswater by the usual
                  road. The lake lay in deep repose after the agitations of a wet and stormy morning.
                  The trees in Gowbarrow park were in that state when what is gained by the disclosure
                  of their bark and branches compensates, almost, for the loss of foliage, exhibiting
                  the variety which characterises the point of time between autumn and winter. The hawthorns
                  were leafless; their round heads covered with rich green berries, and adorned with
                  arches of green brambles, and eglantines hung with glossy hips; and the grey trunks
                  of some of the ancient oaks, which <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2550">[Page]</span> in the summer season might have been regarded only for their venerable majesty, now
                  attracted notice by a pretty embellishment of green mosses and fern intermixed with
                  russet leaves retained by those slender outstarting twigs which the veteran tree would
                  not have tolerated in his strength. The smooth silver branches of the ashes were bare;
                  most of the alders as green as the Devonshire cottage-myrtle that weathers the snows
                  of Christmas.—Will you accept it as some apology for my having dwelt so long on the
                  woodland ornaments of these scenes—that <a class="colorbox-node" href="n185.html">artists speak of the trees on the banks of Ullswater</a>, and especially along the bays of Stybarrow crags, as having a peculiar character
                  of picturesque intricacy in their stems and branches, which their rocky stations and
                  the mountain winds have combined to give them.
               </p>
               <p>At the end of Gowbarrow park a large herd of deer were either moving slowly or standing
                  still among the fern. I was sorry when a chance-companion, who had joined us by the
                  way, startled them with a whistle, disturbing an image of grave simplicity and thoughtful
                  enjoyment; for I could have fancied that those natives of this wild and beautiful
                  region were partaking with us a sensation of the solemnity of the closing day. The
                  sun had been set some time; and we could perceive that the light was fading away from
                  the coves of Helvellyn, but the lake under a luminous sky, was more brilliant than
                  before. 
               </p>
               <p>After tea at Patterdale, set out again:— <span class="none" id="index.xml-pb-d14573e2560">[Page]</span> a fine evening; <a class="colorbox-node" href="n186.html">the seven stars</a> close to the mountain-top; all the stars seemed brighter than usual. The steeps were
                  reflected in Brotherswater, and, above the lake, appeared like enormous black perpendicular
                  walls. The Kirkstone torrents had been swoln by the rains, and now filled the mountain
                  pass with their roaring, which added greatly to the solemnity of our walk. Behind
                  us, when we had climbed to a great height, we saw one light, very distinct, in the
                  vale, like a large red star—a solitary one in the gloomy region. The cheerfulness
                  of the scene was in the sky above us.
               </p>
               <p>Reached home a little before midnight. The following verses (from the Author's Miscellaneous
                  Poems,) after what has just been read may be acceptable to the reader, by way of conclusion

               frith that is not dry at low water; that of Ravenglass, at the mouth of the Esk, as
               a natural harbour is much the best. The Sea appears to have been retiring slowly for
               ages from this coast. from Whitehaven to St. Bees extends a track of level ground,
               about five miles in length, which formerly must have been under salt water, so as
               to have made an island of the high ground that stretches between it and the Sea.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               should have remembered that the practice of folding sheep by night is unknown among
               these mountains, and that the image of the Shepherd upon the watch is out of its place,
               and belongs only to countries, with a warmer climate, that are subject to ravages
               from beasts of prey. It is pleasing to notice a dawn of imaginative feeling in these
               verses. Tickel, a man of no common genius, chose, for the subject of a Poem, Kensington
               Gardens, in preference to the Banks of the Derwent, within a mile or two of which
               he was born. But this was in the reign of Queen Anne, or George the first. Progress
               must have been made in the interval; though the traces of it, except in the works
               of Thomson and Dyer, are not very obvious.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">It is not improbable that these circles were once numerous, and that many of them
               yet endure in a perfect state, under no very deep covering of soil. A <a class="colorbox-node" href="n094.html">friend of the Author, while making a trench in a level piece of ground, not far from
                  the banks of the Emont</a>, but in no connection with that river, met with some stones which seemed to him formally
               arranged; this excited his curiosity, and preceding, he uncovered a perfect circle
               of stones, from two or three or four feet high, with a <em>sanctum sanctorum,</em>—the whole a complete place of Druidical worship of small dimensions, having the same
               sort of relation to Stonehenge, Long Meg and her Daughters near the river Eden, and
               Karl Lofts near Shap (if this last be not Danish), that a rural chapel bears to a
               stately church, or to one of our noble cathedrals. This interesting little monument
               having passed, with the field in which it was found, into other hands, has been destroyed.
               It is much to be regretted, that the striking relic of antiquity at Shap has been
               in a great measure destroyed also. 
               <p class="noCount"><a class="colorbox-node" href="n095.html">The DAUGHTERS of LONG MEG are placed not in an oblong, as the STONES of SHAP</a>, but in a perfect circle, eighty yards in diameter, and seventy-two in number, and
                  from above three yards high, to less than so many feet: a little way out of the circle
                  stands LONG MEG herself—a single stone eighteen feet high.
               </p> 
               <p class="noCount">When the Author first saw this monument, he came upon it by surprize, therefore might
                  over-rate its importance as an object; but he must say, that though it is not to be
                  compared with Stonehenge, he has not seen any other remains of those dark ages, which
                  can pretend to rival it in singularity and dignity of appearance.

         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">Written some time ago. The injury done since, is more than could have been calculated
               upon. <em><a class="colorbox-node" href="n104.html">Singula de nobis anni praedantur euntes</a></em>. This is in the course of things; but why should the genius that directed the ancient
               architecture of these vales have deserted them? For the bridges, churches, mansions,
               cottages, and their richly fringed and flat-roofed outhouses, venerable as the grange
               of some old abbey, have been substituted structures, in which baldness only seems
               to have been studied, or plans of the most vulgar utility. But some improvement may
               be looked for in future; the gentry <em>recently</em> have copied the old models, and successful instances might be pointed out, if I could
               take the liberty.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">In some places scholars were formerly taught in the church, and at others the school-house
               was a sort of anti-chapel to the place of worship, being under the same roof; an arrangement
               which was abandoned as irreverent. It continues, however, to this day in Borrowdale.
               In the parish register of that chapelry is a notice, that a youth who had quitted
               the valley, and died in one of the towns on the coast of Cumberland, had requested
               that his body should be brought and interred at the foot of the pillar by which he
               had been accustomed to sit while a school-boy. One cannot but regret that parish registers
               so seldom contain any thing but bare names; in a few of this country, especially in
               that of Loweswater, I have found interesting notices of unusual natural occurrences—characters
               of the deceased, and particulars of their lives. There is no good reason why such
               memorials should not be frequent; these <a class="colorbox-node" href="n106.html">short and simple annals</a> would in future ages become precious.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note14"><span class="noteLabel">12. </span><span class="noteBody">One of the most pleasing characteristics of manners in secluded and thinly-peopled
               districts, is a sense of the degree in which human happiness and comfort are dependent
               on the contingency of neighbourhood. This is implied by a rhyming adage common here,
               <em>"<a class="colorbox-node" href="n108.html">Friends are far, when neighbours are nar</a></em>" (near). This mutual helpfulness is not confined to out-of-doors work; but is ready
               upon all occasions. Formerly, if a person became sick, especially the mistress of
               a family, it was usual for those of the neighbours who were more particularly connected
               with the party by amicable offices, to visit the house, carrying a present; this practice,
               which is by no means obsolete, is called <em>owning</em> the family, and is regarded as a pledge of a disposition to be otherwise serviceable
               in a time of disability and distress.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               and Lowes-water. Derwent is distinguished from all the other Lakes by being <em>surrounded</em> with sublimity: the fantastic mountains of Borrowdale to the south, the solitary
               majesty of Skiddaw to the north, the bold steeps of Wallow-crag and Lodore to the
               east, and to the west the clustering mountains of New-lands. Lowes-water is tame at
               the head, but towards its outlet has a magnificent assemblage of mountains. Yet as
               far as respects the formation of such receptacles, the general observation holds good:
               neither Derwent nor Lowes-water derive any supplies from the streams of those mountains
