                  of his journal to his friend Thomas Wharton. Though not intended for publication,
                  this journal was printed posthumously in William Mason’s edition of <em>The Poems of Mr. Gray</em> (1775). Five years later the text was incorporated in the second edition of Thomas
                  West’s <em>Guide</em>, thus becoming a permanent part of the tourist literature. Wordsworth owned Mason’s
                  1776 edition of Gray as well as West’s guidebook.

                  onwards. Owen and Smyser cite an apposite letter, dated 12 July 1816, from Sarah Hutchinson
                  to Thomas Monkhouse: “William and I spent three days, the week before last, with Mr
                  Marshall at Scale Hill, Lowess Water, Buttermere, &amp; Crumock [sic], viewing his estates
                  and manor there, and planning his proposed plantations and Improvements. He is going
                  to plant very largely by the side of the two last lakes—and, as he will only plant
                  native wood, and in no wise sacrifice beauty to convenience, we expect that his labours

               <p class="noCount">The cloud’s-eye vision Wordsworth conjures here is easy to understand with the help
                  of a map. Wordsworth was fond of this passage. In a letter to Lady Beaumont (10 May
                  1810), he wrote, “I am very happy that you have read the Introduction [to <em>Select Views</em>] with so much pleasure…. I though the part about the Cottages well-done; and also
                  liked a sentence where I transport the Reader to the top of one of the Mountains,
                  or rather to the Cloud chosen for his station, and give a sketch of the impressions
                  which the Country might be supposed to make on a feeling mind, contemplating its appearance
                  before it was inhabited.” Commentators have debated the originality of Wordsworth’s
                  wheel metaphor, but it seems to be his own invention (Owen and Smyser 388-89).

                  of Crosthwaite to celebrate mass there on the saint’s feast day and offered forty-day

                     in a Letter to a Friend, by a Late Popular Writer</em>. Earlier in the <em>Guide</em>, Wordsworth reprints Brown’s twenty-line “fragment” on the Vale of Keswick in its

                  known for an immensely popular work entitled <em>An Estimate of the Manners and Principles of the Times</em> (London, 1757); after his death, however, he became important among writers on the

                  Poussin (1594-1665) and his brother-in-law Gaspard Dughet (self-styled “Gaspard Poussin”)
                  (1615-1675) lived primarily in Paris and Rome, respectively, and spent little to no
                  time in the Alps (although Nicolas did paint <em>Hannibal Crossing the Alps</em> in 1625-1627). The French painter Claude Lorrain (1600-1682) visited Tyrol and Bavaria
                  in his twenties but was generally more drawn to beautiful or picturesque settings
                  than sublime landscapes like the Alps. The minor Italian painters Pellegrino Tibaldi
                  (1527-1596) and Bernardino Luini (c. 1482-1532) both resided in Milan, which is located
                  at the southern base of the Alps.

                  purchase a property suitable for the growing Wordsworth clan. Thanks to the assistance
                  of his patron, Lord Lowther, Wordsworth was soon thereafter able to acquire the Broad
                  How farm near Ullswater. Wordsworth never built a family home on the site and sold
                  the property in 1834.
