            <p class="noCount">This appendix assembles illustrative passages from letters directly related to the
               composition, reception, and revision of Wordsworth’s <em>Guide to the Lakes</em>. The selections appear chronologically and are grouped into five key phases in the
               <em>Guide</em>’s history: <a class="link_ref" href="#first" title="">1807–1811</a> (its origination and initial publication in Wilkinson’s <em>Select Views</em>); <a class="link_ref" href="#second" title="">1820</a> (its first appearance under Wordsworth’s name in <em>The River Duddon</em>); <a class="link_ref" href="#third" title="">1821–1834</a> (the text’s evolution into an independent guidebook in the third and fourth editions);
               <a class="link_ref" href="#fourth" title="">1835–1841</a> (Wordsworth’s final revisions and the reception of the fifth edition); and <a class="link_ref" href="#fifth" title="">1842–1850</a> (its reissue in Hudson’s <em>Complete Guide</em> and absorption by the early-Victorian travel book industry).</p>
            <p class="noCount">These excerpts derive from a number of sources, including original letters held at
               various repositories. Unless otherwise indicated in the footnotes, reliable and complete
               transcriptions of those letters by the Wordsworths may be found in <em>The Letters of William and Dorothy Wordsworth</em>, 2nd ed., 8 vols. Oxford UP, 1967–93. Throughout our selections, we regularize punctuation,
               expand abbreviations, and offer slight emendations for the sake of clarity.</p>

               <p>[Note: John Pering, vicar of Skipton and Kildwick in North Yorkshire, toured the Lakes
                  in the summer of 1808 and enjoyed meeting William and Dorothy Wordsworth. Hoping to
                  enhance his travel journal, he later requested a written description of the local
                  mountains from the poet. In this friendly reply, Wordsworth offered several reasons
                  for respectfully declining the request. A copy of Wordsworth’s letter survives in
                  Pering’s manuscript notebook.]</p>
               <p class="noCount">I am pleased to find that this beautiful country has made such an impression upon
                  you as to induce you to record your feelings: but what shall I say to your request
                  that I should communicate to you some description of the same objects?—Alas! you have
                  but a faint notion how disagreeable writing, of all Sorts, is to me, except from the
                  impulse of the moment.</p>
               <p class="noCount">I must be my own Task master or I can do nothing at all. Last autumn I made a little
                  Tour, with my wife, and she was very anxious that I should preserve the memory of
                  it by a written account. I tried to comply with her entreaty, but an insuperable dullness
                  came over me, and I could make no progress.</p>
               <p class="noCount">This simple and true statement I am sure you will deem a sufficient apology for not
                  venturing upon a theme so boundless as this sublime and beautiful region.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Besides, you can easily conceive that objects may be too familiar to a Man, to leave
                  him the power of describing them. This is the case with me in regard to these Lakes
                  and mountains, which are my native Country, and among which I have passed the greatest
                  part of my life: and really I should be utterly at a loss were I about to set myself
                  to a formal delineation of them, or of any part of them, where to begin, and where
                  to end.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">3. <em>Joseph Wilkinson to Samuel Taylor Coleridge, early June 1809</em></span></h2>
               <p>[Note: The only surviving document detailing the negotiations surrounding the <em>Select Views</em> letterpress, this letter was posted by Wilkinson from his home in Norfolk to Grasmere,
                  where Coleridge was residing with the Wordsworths. Presumably overwhelmed with his
                  new periodical, <em>The Friend</em>, Coleridge had apparently suggested Wordsworth as a potential collaborator for Wilkinson.
                  This letter includes Wilkinson’s response to Wordsworth’s concerns over <em>Select Views</em> competing with a similar series by the poet’s artist friend William Green of Ambleside
                  (1725–1811, <em>DNB</em>). On its dating, see note 26  in the introduction to this edition.]</p>
               <p class="noCount">I am just returned from Town, where I have been making arrangements for my publication,
                  and as I have seen some of Mr. Green’s numbers I will be obliged to you if you will
                  tell our friend Wordsworth—that no two works, descriptive of the same country can
                  be more different, or less likely to interfere with each other, than his and mine.
                  But I shall write to Mr. Wordsworth in a few days more fully upon the subject when
                  I hope either Mr. W.—or yourself, or both, will afford me the assistance I shall explain,
                  to enable me to make my work more perfect and acceptable to the public than it otherwise
                  would be.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">4. <em>DW to Catherine Clarkson, 18 November 1809</em></span></h2>
               <p>[Note: Catherine Clarkson, wife of the prominent abolitionist Thomas Clarkson (1760–1846,
                  <em>DNB</em>), was one of Dorothy’s closest friends. The Clarksons lived in the Lake District
                  from 1796 to 1806, during which time they became intimates of the Wordsworths, but
                  now they had moved back to the south of England. Dorothy here praises William’s introduction
                  to <em>Select Views</em> and reports that he is considering publishing his own guidebook apart from Wilkinson,
                  predicting that a guidebook will prove more lucrative than her brother’s poetry. The
                  letter reveals various details about the textual history of <em>Select Views</em>, including that Sara Hutchinson sometimes acted as scribe for the project and that
                  Wordsworth was awaiting proofs of Wilkinson’s prints before setting out on the “descriptions”
                  part of his assignment.]</p>
               <p>Sara has been kept almost constantly busy in transcribing: for William, and for ‘The
                  Friend’; therefore she has desired me to write to you. For William she has been transcribing
                  the introduction to a collection of prints to be published by Mr. Wilkinson of Thetford
                  (of which I believe you know the history as your husband’s name is down among those
                  of the subscribers). I hope you will be interested with William’s part of the work
                  (he has only finished the general introduction, being unable to do the rest till he
                  has seen the prints). It is the only regular and I may say <em>scientific</em> account of the present and past state and appearance of the country that has yet
                  appeared. I think, if he were to write a Guide to the Lakes and prefix this preface,
                  it would sell better, and bring him more money than any of his higher labours. He
                  has some thoughts of doing this; but do not mention it, as Mr. W[ilkinson]’s work
                  should have its fair run. He mentioned to Mr. Wilkinson his scheme, to which I should
                  think that Mr. W. will have no objection; as the Guide will, by calling Mr. W.’s publication
                  to mind, after its first run, perhaps help to keep up the sale.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">5. <em>WW to Joseph Wilkinson, ca. late May or June 1810</em></span></h2>
               <p>[Note: These two businesslike scribbles appear on undated <em>Select Views</em> manuscript material sent by Wordsworth to Wilkinson. The first, inserted in Wordsworth’s
                  hand at the top of a sheet transcribed by Sara Hutchinson, illuminates the collaborative
                  process of <em>Select Views</em>, showing all parties scrambling to keep up with the serial publication schedule.
                  The second, a postscript, implies that Wilkinson’s art had impressed at least some
                  in the extended Wordsworth family. Wordsworth’s notes have been conjecturally dated
                  March 1810 by earlier editors, but our research suggests he wrote them later (see
                  note 46  in our Introduction).]</p>
               <p>My dear Sir, Herewith is matter for two more numbers; I shall send for two additional
                  ones in a couple of days.—You will probably judge best to [print?] matter for two

               <p>[Note: This is the most commonly cited letter related to <em>Select Views</em>, largely because it contains Wordsworth’s private complaints about Wilkinson’s drawings.
                  It begins with his estimate of the best features of his introduction and an explanation
                  of his rhetorical aims before moving on to dismiss Wilkinson’s artwork. Sir George
                  (1753–1827, <em>DNB</em>) and Lady Margaret Beaumont were important patrons of the arts, and Sir George was
                  an amateur landscape painter himself.]</p>
               <p>I am very happy that you have read the Introduction with so much pleasure, and must
                  thank you for your kindness in telling me of it. I thought the part about the Cottages
                  well-done; and also liked a sentence where I transport the Reader to the top of one
                  of the Mountains, or rather to the Cloud chosen for his station, and give a sketch
                  of the impressions which the Country might be supposed to make on a feeling mind,
                  contemplating its appearance before it was inhabited. But what I wished to accomplish
                  was to give a model of the manner in which topographical descriptions ought to be
                  executed, in order to their being either useful or intelligible, by evolving truly
                  and distinctly one appearance from another. In this I think I have not wholly failed.</p>
               <div style="text-align: center">[ . . . ]</div>
               <p class="noCount">The drawings, or Etchings, or whatever they may be called, are, I know[?], such as
                  to you and Sir George must be intolerable. You will receive from them that sort of
                  disgust which I do from bad Poetry, a disgust which can never be felt in its full
                  strength, but by those who are practised in an art, as well as Amateurs of it. I took
                  Sir George’s subscription as a kindness done to myself; and Wilkinson though not superabundant
                  in good sense told me that he saw it in that light. I do however sincerely hope that
                  the Author and his Wife (who certainly, notwithstanding her faults and foibles, is
                  no ordinary Woman) may be spared any mortification from hearing them condemned severely
                  by acknowledged judges. They will please many who in all the arts are most taken with
                  what is most worthless. I do not mean that there is not in simple unadulterated minds
                  a sense of the beautiful and sublime in art; but into the hands of few such do prints
                  or picture fall.</p>

                              was regarded by Southey as “by far the most faithful delineator of the scenery of
                              the Lakes” (The Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey, ed. Charles Cuthbert Southey,
                              vol. 5, Longman, 1850, 52). For his part, Wordsworth wrote three sonnets in 1818 “Suggested

                     </div> published a set of aquatint <em>Views of the Lake and of the Vale of Keswick</em>, for which Robert Southey wrote the introduction. In this letter to her cousin, Wordsworth’s
                     sister-in-law Sara Hutchinson compares Westall’s admirable landscapes with Joseph
                     Wilkinson’s from <em>Select Views</em>. She also compares Southey’s and Wordsworth’s introductions to these respective series.
                     This letter likely captures a general consensus view in the Wordsworth household about
                     the relative values of Wilkinson’s art and Wordsworth’s prose.]</p>

               <p>I hope you will not be disappointed in the 2 N<sup>os</sup> now sent. . . . Westall tells me that the former has gained him great credit amon[g]
                  the Artists for its <em>execution</em>—and I could not have believed tha[t] an Engraving could have given the quiet and
                  solemn feeling inspired by such a scene as the latter. The extra 18<sup>d</sup> upon the 3<sup>rd</sup> is occasioned by the Letter press. W[estall] would scarcely let me pay it, although
                  he said it really cost him as much, ie. the paper &amp; printing, for Southey furnished
                  the matter gratis—Don’t expect from this that it is anything but a mere description—or
                  rather information for it is all about <em>Becks</em> &amp; the waters—intended only to be useful—&amp; not like Wm’s Preface to Wilkinson’s the

               <p>[Note: This letter to Robinson (1775–1867, <em>DNB</em>), notable diarist and friend of both William and Dorothy, records harried efforts
                  to prepare the 1823 <em>Guide</em> for press. Though the 1823 is usually called the fourth edition (following its own
                  title page), Dorothy refers to it as the second, presumably because the 1822 version
                  was the first to be published separately. Note that Dorothy speaks of “our” job preparing
                  this new edition of the <em>Guide</em>. She had contributed to the project at each stage of its evolution, and this new
                  edition would include (without acknowledging her authorship) a second travel account

                  <p>[Note: Henry Hope Reed, professor of English literature and rhetoric at the University
                     of Pennsylvania, was Wordsworth’s American editor. In this letter, the poet expresses
                     pleasure in finding that Reed has appreciated the intertwined nature of his poetry
                     and prose. Reed had written to Wordsworth in January 1839, thanking him for a copy
                     of the 1835 <em>Guide</em> and offering what would become a typical North American response: “It may not be uninteresting
                     to you to learn that a volume so purely local in its nature should afford so much
                     value to a distant reader as I have drawn from it. I have found it a guide to the
                     mind in kindred scenes and that it cultivates a taste for landscape which finds its
                     indulgence in the worthy admiration of regions that are accessible to us.”

                              Concerning it, Reed wrote (in the May letter mentioned by the poet), “I was not less
                              surprised than delighted in finding so much more of permanent and universal interest
                              than I had any reason to look for in a work professedly of an occasional character.
                              I cannot better convey the impression it has made on my mind than by saying that I
                              cherish it with the same feeling as the poems, and therefore is it that I am anxious
                              to see them conjoined. No reader, who duly appreciates the latter, can fail to perceive
                              that th…</span></div>

                     my other writings. . . . It was I repeat gratifying to me that you should have spoken
                     of that work as you do, and particularly that you should have considered it in relation
                     to my Poems, somewhat in the same manner you had done in respect to my little Book
                     upon the Lakes.</p>

               (in the May letter mentioned by the poet), “I was not less surprised than delighted
               in finding so much more of permanent and universal interest than I had any reason
               to look for in a work professedly of an <em>occasional</em> character. I cannot better convey the impression it has made on my mind than by saying
               that I cherish it with the same feeling as the poems, and therefore is it that I am
               anxious to see them conjoined. No reader, who duly appreciates the latter, can fail
               to perceive that the Tract is rich in the same elements of thought and feeling.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
