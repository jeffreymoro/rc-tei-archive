               <div type="section">
                  <head>2nd Edition (2020)</head>
                  <p rend="noCount">Since this <title level="j">Romantic Circles</title> edition of William Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide to the 
                    Lakes</title> first appeared in July 2015, our ongoing research has yielded enough new discoveries and insights about the 
                    text’s complex origins, publication history, and afterlives as to necessitate, in our minds, a revised second edition. While 
                    several resources remain largely unchanged—notably our fully annotated, 
                    illustrated text of the 1835 edition and the bibliographic, cartographic, and textual tools for studying the <title level="m">Guide</title>—we have significantly reworked, extended, and, in some cases, corrected our earlier account 
                    of the essay’s origins, composition, and initial publication. The most significant changes to the critical apparatus 
                    come in our introduction, which incorporates several important findings, and a new appendix offering the most detailed 
                    study to date of the <ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.serialpublication.html">serial publication of 
                    <title level="m">Select Views</title>
                     </ref>. We have also added a new section featuring high-resolution scans of 
                    Wordsworth’s <ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/letterpress_gallery">1810 letterpress</ref> 
                    and silently corrected minor transcription and labeling errors in our earlier edition.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>1st Edition (2015)</head>
                  <p rend="noCount">First published in 1810 and repeatedly revised by its author over the ensuing 25 years, Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> has long been considered a crucial text for scholars of Romantic-era aesthetics, 
                    ecology, travel writing, and tourism. Though the fifth edition of 1835 (the last revised by Wordsworth) has remained 
                    available in reprints and scholarly editions, earlier editions of the <title level="m">Guide</title> continue to be 
                    scarce. This is particularly true of the original 1810 version, which appeared as an anonymous prose supplement to a 
                    set of Lake District sketches by the Rev. Joseph Wilkinson.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">This new digital edition therefore aims to provide scholars, students, and general readers easy and open access to key 
                    editions of the <title level="m">Guide</title> from Wordsworth’s lifetime, including full scans of Wilkinson’s 1810 
                    sketches and Wordsworth’s 1810 and 1835 texts. Accompanying these primary works is an extensive scholarly apparatus, 
                    including a historical and textual introduction to the <title level="m">Guide</title>; detailed hypertext notes on 
                    Wordsworth’s essay; an annotated bibliography of previous scholarly editions and criticism on the <title level="m">Guide</title>; and excerpts from letters by Wordsworth and his circle addressing the work’s production, 
                    reception, and revision.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">Taking advantage of digital technologies, we have also included a parallel-text chart tracking Wordsworth’s sequential 
                    revisions over five editions between 1810 and 1835; dozens of maps, engravings, and photographs of the Lakes; and a 
                    geo-tracking feature that allows readers to pinpoint locations discussed in the <title level="m">Guide</title> with 
                    the click of a mouse. All told, then, this site combines the traditional features of a serious scholarly edition with 
                    digital tools that offer a fresh, and hopefully fuller, experience with one of Wordsworth’s most illuminating, 
                    challenging, and compelling works.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">Numerous students, colleagues, Wordsworth scholars, and enthusiasts have lent their time, talents, and expertise to 
                    this edition. Emily Young and Rachel Wise, who were then remarkable BYU undergraduates, helped launch our research 
                    and transcriptions in 2011 and 2012. At <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title>, Dave Rettenmaier has provided 
                    technical expertise and design savvy from the beginning; Tilar Mazzeo shepherded our 2015 edition from proposal to 
                    release; Michele Speitz spearheaded the publication of this 2019 version; and Neil Fraistat, Steven Jones, Orrin 
                    Wang, and Paul Youngquist have offered unwavering support at the executive level.</p>
               <p rend="noCount">At our home campus, BYU, the English Department, Office of Digital Humanities, and Center for the Study of Europe 
                    provided generous financial support for research and travel, and a university Mentoring Environment Grant allowed us to 
                    hire student collaborators and take them on a week-long research trip to the Lake District.</p>
               <p rend="noCount">For years of enthusiastic support and expert responses to obscure queries, special gratitude is in order for Jeff 
                    Cowton, MBE, head curator at the Wordsworth Trust. Dating to a memorable afternoon in the Jerwood Centre during the 
                    spring of 2011, Jeff’s generosity has not only yielded more authoritative editions but also institutional 
                    partnerships that have enriched hundreds of lives at BYU. Warm thanks also to the Wordsworth Trust’s assistant curators, 
                    Rebecca Turner and Melissa Mitchell, for cheerful, timely assistance with countless queries sent from Provo to 
                    Grasmere over the better part of a decade.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">Preface to the Second Edition:</hi> The initial 2015 release of this <title level="j">Romantic Circles</title> 
                    edition of William Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> provided unprecedented resources for 
                    studying an essay that, over two centuries after its first publication, is still considered a classic in the English 
                    environmentalist tradition and one of its author’s greatest accomplishments in prose. Gratefully, our edition has been 
                    warmly received and widely used. Subsequent to its completion, however, our ongoing research on Wordsworth’s essay has 
                    yielded important discoveries about its origins, composition, and circulation, many of which elucidate or undercut 
                    traditional narratives surrounding the <title level="m">Guide</title> that informed our 2015 edition. Accordingly, 
                    with <title level="j">Romantic Circles</title>’ support, we set out to update, revise, and supplement our earlier work 
                    in this second digital edition of Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title>. (For a full list of changes, see 
                    <ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.about.html">About This Edition</ref>.)</p>
               <p rend="noCount">The findings that occasioned this edition are presented in a new appendix,  
                    <ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.serialpublication.html">
                     <title level="a">The Serial Publication of <title level="m">Select Views</title>,</title>
                  </ref> and the 
                      completely revised introduction that follows. This trove of additional material may well leave some readers 
                      feeling we have crossed the hazy border between the properly expansive 
                    and genuinely bloated. Bearing this in mind, we have provided links at the head of this document allowing readers 
                    to go directly to sections of particular interest. Section I (<ref target="#section1">A 
                    <title level="m">Guide</title> for the Twenty-first Century</ref>) of this introduction offers a brief history of 
                    reactions to and scholarship on the <title level="m">Guide</title> before outlining the purposes and value of this 
                    online edition. Section II (<ref target="#section2">Joseph Wilkinson and <title level="m">Select Views</title> 
                        [1810]</ref>) introduces the amateur artist and former neighbor of the Lake Poets whose series of Lake District 
                    drawings included the first published version of Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title>. Sections III 
                    (<ref target="#section3">William Wordsworth: Ghost Writer</ref>), IV (<ref target="#section4">Drafting and Publishing 
                        the First Edition</ref>), and V (<ref target="#section5">Expanding and Revising the 
                            <title level="m">Guide</title> [1820–1835]</ref>) chronicle Wordsworth’s unprecedented—and often 
                    fraught—experience working as Wilkinson’s pen-for-hire and his obsessive reworkings of the <title level="m">Guide</title> 
                    for four new editions published between 1820 and 1835. Finally, Sections VI (<ref target="#section6">Writing the Lake 
                        District</ref>) and VII (<ref target="#section7">The Originality of Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title>
                  </ref>) 
                    explore the rise of Lake District tourism during the poet’s lifetime and how his <title level="m">Guide</title> both 
                    draws upon and surpasses earlier works on the region, the picturesque, and the preservation of cherished landscapes.</p>

               <head>I. A <title level="m">Guide</title> for the Twenty-first Century</head>
               <p>Since first appearing under William Wordsworth’s name in 1820, the <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title>, as it 
                   has come to be known, has never lacked for admirers.<note place="foot" resp="editors">As detailed below, Wordsworth’s 
                       essay appeared under various names before he titled his fifth, and final, revised edition of 1835 
                       <title level="m">A Guide through the District of the Lakes in the North of England</title>. The shorthand 
                       <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> became common in the late nineteenth century and even more firmly 
                       fixed with Ernest De Sélincourt’s 1906 edition, <title level="m">Wordsworth’s Guide to the Lakes</title> (London: 
                       Henry Frowde). Keeping with convention, then, we refer to all editions as the <title level="m">Guide to the 
                           Lakes</title> (or simply the <title level="m">Guide</title>). Given that William Wordsworth is the principal 
                       focus of this edition, “Wordsworth” designates him throughout, though occasionally we use his first name 
                       in passages mentioning multiple Wordsworths. When referring to Dorothy Wordsworth, we use her given name 
                       to avoid confusion.</note> Early reviewers lavished the sort of uniform and unqualified praise upon this extended 
                   essay on England’s Lake District that its writer had long coveted for his poetry, dubbing it a 
                   “very agreeable performance” (the <title level="j">Literary Gazette</title>), “as topographically 
                   useful as it is <emph>poetically picturesque</emph>” 
                   (the <title level="j">Monthly Review</title>), and “by far the best specimen of the prose style of Wordsworth which has 
                   ever been given to the world” (<title level="j">Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</title>).<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                   and has remained a classic study of landscape aesthetics and environmental ethics ever since. In introducing his 
                   1879 edition of Wordsworth’s poems, Matthew Arnold famously recounted how an ill-informed tourist once asked the 
                   poet “if he had ever written anything besides the <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title>. Yes, he answered 
                   modestly, he had written verses.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Matthew Arnold, <title level="a">Preface,</title>

                   later, Andrew James Symington conjectured that there was “not an inn or small farmhouse” mentioned in the <title level="m">Guide</title> “which does not reap in hard coin the results.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Andrew

                   claims for its timelessness. No less a card-carrying modernist than Virginia Woolf revered it as a “happily permanent 
                   friend” that offered “all the courtesy and consideration of an old inhabitant who does the honours of the place to a 
                   stranger.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Virginia Woolf, <title level="a">Then and Now, 1906,</title>

                   twentieth century, the pioneering eco-critic Jonathan Bate bemoaned scholarly neglect of this “exemplar of Romantic 
                   ecology,” insisting that, “If we are to historicize Romanticism, we must bring the <title level="m">Guide</title> from

               </p>
               <p>Wordsworth himself was unmistakably proud of the <title level="m">Guide</title>, revising it more fully and repeatedly 
                   than any of his prose works and fondly referring to it over the years as “my little Book on the Lakes.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                       1967–1993), 4:120, 4:178, 6:48, 6:81.</note> As detailed below, he originally drafted this topographic, 
                   historical, and cultural introduction to his native region as the anonymous letterpress for <title level="m">Select 
                       Views in Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire</title> (1810), a set of 48 prints of landscape sketches 
                   by the Reverend Joseph Wilkinson (1764–1831). In the years ahead, Wordsworth trimmed the roughly 27,700-word essay of 
                   1810 to 20,200 words, meticulously revised the remaining sections, and published it under his own name as an appendix to 
                   his <title level="m">River Duddon</title> collection of 1820. Deciding soon thereafter to repurpose his essay as a 
                   full-fledged guidebook, he expanded it to 29,800 words for the first stand-alone version of the <title level="m">Guide</title> of 1822 and made further additions and revisions for new editions of 1823 (35,300 words) 
                   and 1835 (38,300 words). Finally, in 1842, having shepherded five editions of the <title level="m">Guide</title> to 
                   press over three decades, the 72-year-old Wordsworth supervised the Kendal publishers Hudson and Nicholson’s reprinting 
                   of his 1835 text in a volume including Adam Sedgwick’s groundbreaking studies of Lake District geology.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The full title of Hudson and Nicholson’s 1842 edition is <title level="m">A Complete Guide to the

                       While this unrevised version is not always accounted for in textual histories of the <title level="m">Guide</title>, 
                       Wordsworth remained actively involved in the publication process.</note>
               </p>
               <p>For four decades after its initial 1822 release as an independent title, the <title level="m">Guide</title> enjoyed 
                   steady, if never spectacular, sales, with new British editions appearing in 1823, 1835, 1842, 1843, 1846, 1853, and 
                   1859. Then, thanks to Wordsworth’s lofty status among the Victorians and the expiration of the 1835 edition’s copyright 
                   in 1877, it regularly resurfaced in complete-works collections and new-generation travel guides. Inexplicably, however, 
                   nearly a half-century passed between the 1859 printing and the next stand-alone version, the Ernest De Sélincourt edition 
                   of 1906 that introduced Wordsworth’s essay to a new generation of readers. Over the rest of the twentieth century, 
                   it remained generally available, whether through 1926 and 1970 reissues of De Sélincourt or illustrated editions by 
                   R. J. Hutchings (1977) and Peter Bicknell (1984); and today most early editions are freely available through platforms 
                   like Google Books and the HathiTrust Digital Library.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For details on the successive

               <p>As noted above, the earliest version of Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> appeared as the 
                    anonymous prose supplement to the Rev. Joseph Wilkinson’s <title level="m">Select Views in Cumberland,  Westmoreland, 
                        and Lancashire</title>, a series of engravings sold primarily to affluent collectors of landscape prints and 
                    associates of the artist.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Wilkinson was apparently unaware of a 1792 series of 
                        landscape prints bearing a nearly identical title: Peter Holland’s <title level="m">Select Views of the Lakes in 
                            Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire</title> (Liverpool: James Smith). For details on the collecting of

                    offering the commission in mid-1809 and Wordsworth’s completing it in late 1810, the two never spoke in person, as the 
                    poet lived in Grasmere in the Lake District and the artist 300 miles to the southeast in Thetford, Norfolk, where he 
                    served as rector of East and West Wretham and domestic chaplain to the Marquis of Huntly. Wilkinson was a Lakelander 
                    at heart, however. After being raised in Carlisle, he left for Cambridge in his late teens before returning in 1794, 
                    at age thirty, when his wife became the caregiver for her ailing uncle, the renowned chemist William Brownrigg. During 
                    the decade they ultimately spent at Ormathwaite Hall, Brownrigg’s home near Keswick, Wilkinson devoted his time to 
                    sketching the region’s beauties and serving as curate of Irthington (near Carlisle) and Monkwearmouth (near 
                    Sunderland).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Unlike William Brownrigg (1711–1800, <title level="m">DNB</title>), who 
                        was famed for his work on mine gasses, table salt, and platinum’s physical properties, Wilkinson remained 
                        obscure throughout his life. A brief obituary in the <title level="j">Gentleman’s Magazine</title> noted his

                        the Southeys made a long visit in 1801, they didn’t relocate to Keswick until September 1803.</note> This, in 
                    turn, brought them into the orbit of the Wordsworths. Dorothy Wordsworth’s journals from 1802 capture growing intimacy 
                    with the Wilkinsons, recording her brother and Coleridge visiting Ormathwaite, the families dining together in 
                    Keswick, her walking “with Mrs. W. [to] the Quakers’ meeting,” and their receiving “Wilkinson’s drawings” by 
                    post.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See the entries for 29 and 31 March (p. 83) and 1 July 1802 (p. 117) in

                        suggests Wordsworth may have met Wilkinson as early as 1794, as the clergyman’s sisters had married brothers of 
                        the poet’s friend James Losh (p. 229). For additional interactions between the families, see Reed, 
                        <title level="m">Middle Years</title>, 157, 163–64, and 184. That Dorothy knew the Ormathwaite house well is 
                        suggested by a 1 Jan. 1810 letter to her childhood friend Jane Marshall in which she opines, “the imagination 
                        cannot conceive a more delightful place” but laments, “there are no large rooms and it is an old house, and I 
                        should think even out of repair” (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:381–82).</note> Of the three Lake Poets, 
                    Southey was apparently closest to Wilkinson. In a 7 January 1804 letter to William Taylor, Southey mentions how 
                    Wilkinson “is my neighbour at present &amp; a very excellent one I find him.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                        Cockermouth.</note> Two years later, after the Wilkinsons had moved to Thetford, Southey made a lengthy detour 
                    to visit them during a trip to the south. Writing his wife back in Keswick, the poet reported that their old 
                    neighbor remained “the very cream of human kindness.” Still, having moved to a region “utterly without beauty,” the 
                    couple openly pined for the Lakes. Wilkinson, he reports, grew sentimental “at the thought of Ormathwaite,” and “Mrs 
                    W. never looks at the drawing of it but the tears come in her eyes.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                        The two remained in close contact at least through the end of 1807, when Southey informed Wilkinson of his 
                        brother’s plan to practice medicine near Thetford (see 
                        <ref target="/editions/southey_letters/Part_Three/HTML/letterEEd.26.1405.html">Letter 1405</ref>, 27 Dec.

               <p>The “drawing of it” that Mrs. Wilkinson apparently found so affecting may have been one of the two sketches of 
                    Ormathwaite her husband intended for <title level="m">Northern Scenery in a Series of Drawings</title>, an earlier 
                    attempt at publishing his artwork that he abandoned in the mid-1790s. Why <title level="m">Northern Scenery</title> 
                    never went to press remains a mystery, as Wilkinson not only completed forty-nine drawings for the series but 
                    also commissioned the Manchester artist William Marshall Craig to design a title page and multiple frontispieces 
                    (figs. 1 and 2).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Wilkinson’s <title level="m">Northern Scenery</title> drawings,

               <p>Buoyed by such support, in late 1808 Wilkinson circulated his first call for subscribers to <title level="m">Select 
                    Views</title> in small newspapers serving his Thetford parish. (For full details on his decision to publish serially 
                    and by subscription, see <ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.serialpublication.html">Appendix 
                        1</ref>.) At this point, Wilkinson planned to include sketches of the two principal Lake District counties, 
                    Cumberland and Westmoreland, plus “Part of Scotland.” He also apparently imagined a primarily local subscriber base, 
                    as he confined his advertisements to the nearby <title level="j">Bury and Norwich Post</title> and 
                    <title level="j">Norfolk Chronicle</title> and directed would-be subscribers to the town booksellers in Thetford and 
                    Bury (fig. 3). Yet, for a first-time author preparing what was essentially a vanity publication, Wilkinson 
                    displayed an impressive understanding of the conventional design, distribution, and pricing of such series, an expertise 
                    likely acquired via his hobby of collecting of landscape prints.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In his 1797 travel 
                        diary, Johnson Grant notes how, while at “Armathwaite,” his party was “entertained by many paintings and prints, 
                        collected by Mr. Wilkinson and his brother, an Oxford man, who both take sketches well themselves” (273). Grant’s 
                        <title level="a">Journal of a Three Weeks Tour, in 1797, through Derbyshire to the Lakes</title> appeared anonymously 
                        in Vol. 5 of William Mavor’s <title level="m">The British Tourists; or Traveller’s Pocket Companion, through England, 
                            Wales, Scotland, and Ireland</title>, 5 vols. (London: Newbery, 1798).</note> Although he would eventually 
                    narrow his geographic focus and target a nationwide audience, in most particulars the series Wilkinson proposed in 
                    late 1808—48 plates measuring “14 inches by 10 inches” to be distributed four at a time over 12 months, “executed by 
                    the most eminent Artists,” and printed on quality paper that would “admit of tinting”—closely corresponded with what 
                    subscribers actually received in 1810.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Although <title level="m">Select Views</title> 
                        is frequently described and cataloged as a folio, it was slightly larger than the traditional volume advertised as 
                        such. Later advertisements (e.g., fig. 7) promise the use of oversized “double Elephant” (or 41” x 27”) paper. 
                        Folded in half, this paper measured 20.5” x 13.5,” making it roughly 1.5” taller and wider than those found in the 
                        standard 12” x 19” folio. These large sheets help account for the series’ unusually wide margins.</note>

                        (1808–10). This popular series—the last number of which appeared on the same day, 1 Jan. 1810, as the first 
                        of <title level="m">Select Views</title>—featured a more extensive letterpress than any previous Ackermann title.

                    to include supplementary prose, a second set of notices that began appearing in national magazines in February 1809 now 
                    indicated that the sketches of “the most picturesque situations” would indeed appear “with letter-press descriptions”

               <p>Only one document, a letter Wilkinson sent Coleridge in early June 1809, survives from the negotiations that 
                        resulted in Wordsworth contributing to <title level="m">Select Views</title> 
                        (<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.letters.html#letter3">letter 3</ref>).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Now in the Wordsworth Trust archives, Wilkinson’s letter to Coleridge is reproduced in Owen 
                            and Smyser, <title level="m">Prose Works</title> (2:124) and Reed, <title level="m">Middle Years</title> 
                            (p. 671). Two details suggest this undated letter was written in early June 1809. First, Wilkinson reports 
                            having read “with much pleasure &amp; interest” the first issue of Coleridge’s <title level="m">The 
                                Friend</title>, which appeared on 1 June 1809. Second, in a separate letter dated 10 June 1809, 
                            Wordsworth conveys to the publisher of <title level="m">The Friend</title> names and addresses for four 
                            new subscribers that Wilkinson had forwarded in his letter (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 8: 17–18). 
                            In early June, Coleridge was away visiting a friend near Penrith, and he wouldn’t return to Grasmere until 
                            the 13th. It therefore appears Wordsworth opened Wilkinson’s letter in his housemate’s absence, as he would 
                            not have otherwise had the subscriber details he forwarded prior to Coleridge’s return. For Coleridge’s 
                            whereabouts during these weeks, see Reed, <title level="m">Middle Years</title>, 430, and Richard Holmes, 
                            <title level="m">Coleridge: Darker Reflections, 1804–1834</title> (New York: Pantheon, 1998), 158–63.</note> 
                        From this, however, we can infer the existence of two earlier letters: an initial query from Wilkinson to Coleridge 
                        and a reply indicating Wordsworth’s potential willingness to contribute if assured <title level="m">Select 
                            Views</title> would not compete with a similar series his friend William Green would soon release. 
                        Wilkinson’s response tackles this concern head-on, reporting, “I am just returned from Town, where I have been 
                        making arrangements for my publication, and as I have seen some of Mr Green[’]s numbers I will be obliged to you 
                        if you will tell our friend Wordsworth—that no two works, descriptive of the same country can be more different, 
                        or less likely to interfere with each other, than his and mine.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">The 
                            Manchester-born Green befriended Wordsworth after moving to nearby Ambleside around 1800. His print 
                            series, <title level="m">Seventy-Eight Studies from Nature</title>, began appearing on 1 Aug. 1809.</note> 
                        Still open to Coleridge’s involvement as well, Wilkinson continues, “I shall write to Mr Wordsworth in a few days 
                        more fully upon the subject, when I hope either Mr W— or yourself, or both, will afford me the assistance I shall 
                        explain to enable me to make my work more perfect and acceptable to the public than it otherwise would be.”</p>
               <p>Wordsworth’s subsequent acceptance of Wilkinson’s commission has long struck 
                        the poet's enthusiasts as a lamentable blight on a career otherwise distinguished for its single-minded 
                        independence. Only eight months earlier, Wordsworth had bristled at the Rev. Joseph Pering’s suggestion that he 
                        write a prose description of his native region. “Alas!,” he declared, “you have but a faint notion how disagreeable

                        than equal partner or co-visionary, has bewildered many. The most 
                        common interpretation is that proffered by Owen and Smyser, who put the case bluntly: “That Wordsworth should 
                        accept Joseph Wilkinson as his ‘Task master’ for even the briefest time surely indicates some kind of financial 
                        hardship.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Owen and Smyser, <title level="m">Prose</title>, 2:124. For similar

               <p>Evidence for this theory is abundant in the Wordsworths’ letters from 1809 and 1810, which paint a vivid portrait 
                        of economic distress. The family’s 1808 cross-town move from the beloved but cramped Dove Cottage to the roomier 
                        Allan Bank had yielded only a steadier stream of house guests and long nights spent scouring walls blackened by 
                        a faulty chimney.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See <title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:282, 364, 367, and 376. 
                            Hardship, of course, is relative, and, it bears noting that, intent on preserving some semblance of gentility, 
                            the family employed at least two servants throughout these lean years.</note> Dorothy’s letters from this 
                        period find her repeatedly imploring her tight-fisted eldest brother, Richard, to spare a mere £5. So straitened 
                        are their circumstances, she reports, that they have resolved “to give over drinking tea, and if possible, to take 
                        a house where coals are cheaper.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                        a rapidly growing household with no counterbalancing source of income. His 1807 collection, <title level="m">Poems, 
                            in Two Volumes</title>, which all had hoped would stabilize his finances and usher him into the front ranks of 
                        living bards, had largely floundered. Reflecting on just how unprofitable poetry had proven, Wordsworth would 
                        estimate in 1812 that he had earned less than £140 for all his verse since 1798.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For the consistently disappointing sales of Wordsworth’s poetry, see Gill,

                        projects offering surer pay. Dorothy reported to Thomas De Quincey on 1 May 1809—just weeks before the arrival of 
                        Wilkinson’s offer—of her brother’s “resolution to write upon publick affairs in the <title level="j">Courier</title>, 
                        or some other newspaper, for the sake of getting money; not wholly however on that account for unless he were

                        William's accepting the <title level="m">Select Views</title> commission is suggested by Dorothy’s musing six months 
                        letter, in an 18 November 1809 letter to Catherine Clarkson, “if he were to write a Guide to the Lakes and prefix 
                        this preface [to <title level="m">Select Views</title>], it would sell better, and bring him more money than any 
                        of his higher labours.” She goes on to note that William, too, “has some thoughts of doing this,” but asks that 
                        her friend “not mention it, as Mr. W[ilkinson]’s work should have its fair run”

               <p>Clearly, then, the promise of immediate pay, and perhaps further income were he to republish his essay in the years 
                        ahead, factored into Wordsworth’s accepting the <title level="m">Select Views</title> commission. Yet, to suggest, 
                        as many earlier scholars have, that this renders the original draft of the <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> 
                        fundamentally compromised, even mercenary, is to concede to the Romantic—and, ironically, Wordsworthian—ideology 
                        that inspired art must be impervious to external concerns.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Influential studies

                        Wilkinson’s letterpress. While the Wordsworths’ economic distress is palpable in surviving letters from 1809, so too 
                        is the poet’s perpetual fear that Coleridge, who had moved in with them in 1808, was veering toward complete mental 
                        breakdown while frenetically attempting to launch his new weekly, <title level="j">The Friend</title>. In light of 
                        this, Wordsworth’s chief incentive for taking the commission may well have been a fear that, were he to reject 
                        it, the already teetering Coleridge would feel duty-bound to accept it out of obligation to an old neighbor who 
                        had, after all, approached him, not Wordsworth.</p>
               <p>For that matter, it is entirely possible that foremost in Wordsworth’s mind when accepting Wilkinson’s offer was 
                        neither his family’s dire finances nor his friend’s fragility but his own artistic, intellectual, and personal 
                        enthusiasm for the proposed project. The <title level="m">Select Views</title> opportunity arrived during what 
                        would prove Wordsworth’s most sustained period of prose composition. In 1809 and 1810 alone, he wrote 30,000-plus 
                        words for <title level="m">Select Views</title>, the 216-page polemic <title level="m">The Convention of

                        developing his long-germinating theories on visual art, landscaping, and natural aesthetics. Wordsworth regularly 
                        takes up these favorite subjects in his correspondence from this period, and years later he allegedly claimed 
                        “there were three callings for success in which Nature had furnished him with qualifications—the callings of poet, 
                        landscape-gardener, and critic of pictures and works of art.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">See

                            fine arts during this period. His “three callings” remark was reportedly made to the Rev. Robert Perceval 
                            Graves, who shared it with Christopher Wordsworth for inclusion in <title level="m">Memoirs of William 
                                Wordsworth</title> (London: Moxon, 1851), 2:482.</note> Perhaps the most compelling evidence that his 
                        primary motivations may, in fact, have been intellectual comes in accounts from preceding years showing him 
                        seriously considering writing on the topics Wilkinson now proposed. The diary of the Whig grandee Lady Holland 
                        chronicles how, at a late August 1807 dinner party in Windermere, Wordsworth claimed to be “preparing a manual to 
                        guide travelers in their tour amongst the Lakes”; and, in a letter from October 1808, Wordsworth himself reports: 
                        “Last autumn, I made a little Tour, with my wife, and she was very anxious that I should preserve the memory of 
                        it by a written account. I tried to comply with her entreaty, but an insuperable dullness came over me, and I 
                        could make no progress.” Close familiarity with the region, he feared, had left him “utterly at a loss” as to 
                        “where to begin, and where to end” on the subject of “these Lakes and mountains” 
                        (<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.letters.html#letter2">letter 2</ref>).<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                            1908). Wordsworth may have exaggerated his actual progress to Lady Holland, as no evidence suggests he had 
                            made headway on a “manual to guide travelers” prior to their dinner. Her diary entry also valuably captures 
                            an embryonic version of what would become the <title level="m">Guide</title>’s famous passages on house 
                            colors. Wordsworth “holds some opinions on picturesque subjects with which I completely differ,” she writes, 
                            “especially as to the effects produced by <emph>white</emph> houses on the sides of the hills; to my taste 
                            they produce a cheerful effect. He, on the contrary, would brown, or even black-work them; he maintained his 
                            opinion with a considerable degree of ingenuity. His objection was chiefly grounded upon the distances being 
                            confounded by the glare of white” (2:231).</note>
               </p>
               <p>Whatever incentivized his reversal, Wordsworth at last felt ready to tackle this long-deferred project in the 
                        summer of 1809. Oddly enough, however, Wilkinson stayed close-lipped about having secured the poet’s services. 
                        The final calls for subscribers to <title level="m">Select Views</title> touted his agreements with Rudolph 
                        Ackermann, the elite London print dealer who had signed on as publisher, and W. F. Wells, a London engraver 
                        “whose professional merits are too well known, from his etchings . . . to need any comment.” Yet, neither these 
                        advertisements, the wrappers that bore monthly installments, nor the final published text so much as hinted that 
                        the letterpress descriptions of the Lake District would be penned by the region’s most famous living writer 
                        (figs. 5 and 6). The unmistakable conclusion, then, is that, consistent with the logic of vanity publishing, 
                        Wilkinson had sought out the Lake Poets not to capitalize on their reputations but, by presenting  
                        their words as his own, to cast himself in the best possible light. He implies as much in his previously cited 
                        letter to Coleridge from June 1809, which explains his desire for a surrogate who would “make my work more perfect 
                        and acceptable to the public than it otherwise would be” 
                        (<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.letters.html#letter3">letter 3</ref>).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Noting that Wordsworth stayed mum until 1820 about his

               <p>By agreeing to help Wilkinson in this capacity, Wordsworth—the poet who came to define for many the ideal of an 
                        inspired, autonomous modern author—ironically took on the most unlikely of roles: the ghost writer. 
                        Not that Wordsworth would have conceived of it as such, as the term wouldn’t be coined until the 1920s and the 
                        lack of an earlier equivalent suggests what we call “ghost-writing” had yet to be codified in taxonomies of 
                        authorship.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Although the <title level="m">OED</title> dates the earliest use of 
                            “ghost writer” to 1927, Graves Glenwood Clark seems to self-consciously coin the term a few years earlier 
                            in “The Ghost Writer and His Story,” <title level="m">The Editor: The Journal of Information for Literary

                            ghost-writing. It appears, however, to have emerged as a byproduct of the professionalization of authorship 
                            during the late eighteenth century. Samuel Johnson was among the first major authors to specialize in the 
                            craft, ghost-writing at least twenty-eight sermons (only two of which, however, were published). See James 
                            Gray, <title level="m">Johnson’s Sermons: A Study</title> (Oxford: Oxford UP, 1972), 7–10.</note> However 
                        anachronistic the label, though, Wordsworth’s unacknowledged and deliberately obscured contributions to 
                        <title level="m">Select Views</title> clearly exemplify ghost-writing as recently defined by John C. Knapp and 
                        Azalea M. Hulbert: “the writing of material by one person (the writer) for use by another (the client) who will 
                        be credited with its authorship, and where both parties agree that the writer’s role will be invisible to readers

               <p>Although no surviving records detail what Wordsworth was to write or his agreed-upon deadlines and fees, he clearly 
                        had two basic assignments. First, he was to compose a general survey of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire, 
                        the three Lakeland counties featured in Wilkinson’s sketches. For this part of the letterpress, he was under no 
                        obligation to reference specific drawings, which meant he could compose it while Wilkinson’s sketches were being 
                        engraved. Then, once proofs of the prints were available, his second task would be providing “appropriate 
                        Letter-press Descriptions” of the specific scenes the artist had depicted. Presumably, what Wilkinson had in 
                        mind—and what Wordsworth ultimately failed to deliver—were the brief notes, which could be as short as a sentence 
                        or as long as several paragraphs, that were increasingly desired by purchasers wishing to learn more about the 
                        distinctive qualities or histories of the series’ featured sites. Such descriptions were fast becoming the norm 
                        in Ackermann sets, and, tellingly, Wilkinson’s one later series, <title level="m">The Architectural Remains of 
                            the Ancient Town and Borough of Thetford</title> (1822), featured conventional examples of the genre

               <p>Unsurprisingly, Wordsworth’s enthusiasm and output corresponded directly to the relative independence these 
                        particular tasks afforded. After likely accepting Wilkinson’s commission sometime in the latter half of June 1809, 
                        he made little headway over a summer spent entertaining house guests. As Dorothy Wordsworth informed De 
                        Quincey on 1 August, William had “not done anything of late, indeed we have had so much company that it was 
                        scarcely possible for him to feel sufficiently independent to devote himself to composition.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:364.</note> Yet, once their visitors departed, Wordsworth 
                        dove into the project with considerable energy. Writing her friend Catherine Clarkson on 18 November, 
                        Dorothy reports that Sara Hutchinson—the sister of William's wife, Mary, and a current member 
                        of the household—was “transcribing the 
                        introduction to a collection of prints to be published by Mr. Wilkinson of Thetford (of which I believe you know 
                        the history as your husband’s name is down among those of the subscribers).” Although William had “only finished 
                        the general introduction, being unable to do the rest till he has seen the prints,” Dorothy was already prepared to  
                        anoint this earliest version of the <title level="m">Guide</title> “the only regular and I may say 
                        <emph>scientific</emph> account of the present and past state and appearance of the country that has yet 
                        appeared.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:372.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Less surprising than her enthusiastic appraisal is Dorothy’s uncharacteristically understated report of her 
                        brother having thus far “only” finished his introduction. By any objective standard, William set a remarkably brisk 
                        pace in drafting an 18,000-word, meticulously researched, and vividly rendered section that, when set in type, 
                        became the 34-page “Introduction” serialized over the first eight months of 1810  (pp. 1–34 of the 
                        <ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/1810-letterpress-scans">letterpress</ref> and paras. 1–56 of 
                        <ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.1810.html">our transcription</ref>). This initial 
                        task completed, however, his pace slowed to a crawl. He would ultimately need the entire year between 
                        November 1809 and November 1810 to supply the “descriptions” that, once set in type, filled a mere twelve pages 
                        (pp. 35–46 / para. 57–75). Part of the problem, as Dorothy implied in November 1809, was that the momentum he 
                        established in completing the introduction was lost while awaiting the prints he was expected to describe.</p>

               <p>The spotty archival record chronicles the mounting frustrations that soured Wordsworth and Wilkinson’s 
                        relationship over the course of 1810. Whereas Dorothy had signaled their enduring enthusiasm for the project 
                        the previous November, the next surviving mention of <title level="m">Select Views</title>, in William’s 10 
                        May 1810 letter to Lady Margaret Beaumont 
                        (<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.letters.html#letter6">letter 6</ref>), reveals how 
                        repugnant the task had become. Addressing a correspondent who, while a close friend, outranked him both in 
                        society and the world of visual arts, Wordsworth preemptively—and gracelessly—distances his letterpress from 
                        Wilkinson’s “drawings, or Etchings, or whatever they may be called.” He fully expects that, upon perusing 
                        Wilkinson’s “intolerable” sketches, Lady Beaumont and her artist husband, Sir George, “will receive from them 
                        that sort of disgust which I do from bad Poetry, a disgust which can never be felt in its full strength, but 
                        by those who are practised in an art, as well as Amateurs of it.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

               </p>
               <p>While no extant letters offer Wilkinson’s side of the story, the collaboration likely left him 
                        similarly exasperated. Various manuscript fragments show that the slapdash “descriptions” Wordsworth submitted 
                        during the first half of 1810 made no concerted effort to align with Wilkinson’s sketches. Worse, Wordsworth 
                        assumed a peremptory tone toward his putative employer, scrawling at the top of one manuscript, “Herewith is 
                        matter for two more numbers; I shall send for two additional ones in a couple of days. – You will probably judge 
                        best to print matter for two numbers with each month as [you] have only six months before you, and your numbers 
                        are 12.” Wilkinson unsurprisingly balked at printing whatever scraps Wordsworth sent him, instructing the writer 
                        to condense and combine material originally submitted as “Section 2: On the best approach to the Lakes, &amp;c.” 
                        and “Section 3d: Donnerdale continued &amp;c. &amp;c.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">See DCMS 68.3A and 68.3D 
                            at the Wordsworth Trust. Both manuscripts are undated and in Sara Hutchinson’s hand, with Wordsworth’s note 
                            to Wilkinson (“Herewith is matter for two more numbers . . . ”) superimposed over the header for “Section 2.” 
                            In his 1993 supplement to the Wordsworths’ <title level="m">Letters</title>, Alan G. Hill tentatively dates 
                            William’s note on DCMS 68.3A to early March 1810, since his amanuensis, Sara Hutchinson, moved to her 
                            brother’s home in Wales in mid-March. Yet, in mentioning that Wilkinson had “only six months before you,” 
                            Wordsworth presumably meant that, while six of the twelve monthly instalments (i.e., Jan.–June) had 
                            shipped, six (i.e., July–Dec.) remained. If this reading is correct, he sent his manuscript and the inscribed 
                            note to Wilkinson sometime between late May (when the June installment was in print) and mid-June (before 
                            July’s was complete). This would confirm Hill’s alternate theory that Hutchinson copied the manuscript 
                            before leaving in mid-March and Wordsworth added his note later, when he “judged the moment right to send 
                            Wilkinson more copy” (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 8:20).</note> Referencing this request, Wordsworth 
                        reported in a 22 July letter to his wife, Mary, that Dorothy “has been so good as to abridge the sheets I wrote 
                        for Wilkinson[;] for my own part I have no longer any interest in the thing; so he must make what he can of them; 
                        as I can not do the thing in my own way I shall merely task myself with getting through it with the least 
                        trouble" (<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.letters.html#letter7">letter 7</ref>).<note place="foot" resp="editors">

               <p>The abridgements Dorothy apparently made of “Section 2” and “Section 3d” eventually appeared in the October 1810 
                        number of <title level="m">Select Views</title>, forming the first half of the hodge-podge labelled “Section II” at 
                        the end of the letterpress (pp. 37–46).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For the serialization dates for specific

                            this edition.</note> That task completed, the Wordsworths put off drafting the second half of “Section II” 
                        until mid-November. Writing Catherine Clarkson on 12 November 1810, Dorothy reports that “not being permitted to 
                        follow his own course” had proven so “irksome” to William that he had “employed me to compose a description or 
                        two for the finishing of his work for Wilkinson.” With trademark self-deprecation, she notes, “I daresay you 
                        will find this latter part very flat.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                            2:449.</note> Meanwhile, on the other end, Wilkinson and Ackermann were left in the lurch by Wordsworth’s 
                        recalcitrance and procrastination. After apparently receiving no new material from the writer in 
                        October, they shipped the penultimate November number without any letterpress pages. And, with Dorothy still 
                        dashing off descriptions in mid-November, they may well have anticipated needing to write the concluding paragraphs 
                        of “Section II” themselves in order to send some semblance of a completed letterpress with the final installment due 
                        to ship by month’s end.</p>

               <p>Consequently, it must have been with at least partly gritted teeth that, in inscribing Wordsworth’s copy of 
                        <title level="m">Select Views</title> soon thereafter, Wilkinson signed himself the poet’s “faithful, and 
                        Obliged Friend” (fig. 8). The delivery of this presentation copy is the last known interaction of any sort between 
                        the two. That, a decade later, members of Wordsworth’s household felt at least some lingering animus is suggested 
                        by Sara Hutchinson’s 1820 jibe that “Wm’s Preface to Wilkinson’s [series was] the only part of the Publication 
                        worth any thing” (<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.letters.html#letter11">letter 11</ref>).<note place="foot" resp="editors">15 Oct. 1820 letter to John Monkhouse in

                                exactly as it had appeared in 1810 (i.e., no revisions, same font and page layout, identical pagination).

                        nor consult the poet about these reissues, he apparently wasn’t alone in foregoing such courtesies. For, while 
                        Dorothy conceded in November 1809 that any repurposing of her brother’s texts would need to wait until 
                        <title level="m">Select Views</title> had had “its fair run,” there is no evidence of Wordsworth’s either securing 
                        permission to republish the material copyrighted under Wilkinson’s name or notifying him of the three revisions of 
                        the <title level="m">Select Views</title> letterpress he published before the artist’s 1831 death.</p>

                            parallel-text chart</ref> illustrates, the quarter-century Wordsworth ultimately spent revising the 
                        <title level="m">Guide</title> off and on rendered an 1835 text that is markedly different from the 1810 original. 
                        Of the fifth edition’s 139 paragraphs, only 56 originated in <title level="m">Select Views</title>, and most of 
                        these were meaningfully altered in intervening editions. Yet, perhaps the most dramatic changes to the 
                        <title level="m">Guide</title> between 1810 and 1835 were external rather than internal. The earliest readers of 
                        Wordsworth’s essay would have encountered it in heavy tomes that gathered and bound all twelve installments of the 
                        folio-sized engravings and letterpress pages from Wilkinson’s series.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Most 
                            collectors would have set aside the monthly installments of <title level="m">Select Views</title> either at

                            uniformity of surviving copies, which generally include all 48 engravings and follow the order prescribed on 
                            Wilkinson’s contents page (which shipped with the final number). For details on binding practices during this

                        or roughly the size of the average desk’s working surface. Factor in its 7.5-pound (3.4 kg) weight, and it is 
                        difficult to imagine many readers perusing Wordsworth’s letterpress while walking the fells or traveling in

                        Wordsworth’s essay would have been read and used in myriad new contexts. As illustrated below in figure 9, the 
                        books in which the earliest versions of the <title level="m">Guide</title> appeared gradually shrunk from the 
                        unwieldy Wilkinson folio of 1810, to the comparatively portable <title level="m">River Duddon</title> octavo of 
                        1820, and finally to the pocket-sized duodecimo of 1822 (the basic size retained for the 1823 and 1835 editions). 
                        And, at 7 ounces (203 g), the 1835 edition weighed a full 7 pounds less than bound copies of

               <p>Although, as we have seen, in November 1809 the Wordsworth siblings were already imagining that William’s draft 
                        introduction for Wilkinson might be refashioned as the “prefix” to his own “Guide to the Lakes,” eleven years 
                        would elapse before he would publish an abridged and revised version under his own name as the “annex” to his 
                        1820 sonnet collection, <title level="m">The River Duddon</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Between 1809 
                            and 1812, Wordsworth returned to key themes from <title level="m">Select Views</title> in two essays known 
                            today as the <title level="a">Unpublished Tour</title> and <title level="a">The Sublime and the 
                                Beautiful.</title> He left these pieces unfinished, however, when his 1812 pension from Lord Lonsdale and 
                            1813 appointment as Distributor of Stamps gave him the financial freedom to return to poetry. Core ideas 
                            from both essays would inform later versions of the <title level="m">Guide</title>. See Gill, <title level="m">Life</title>, 295–96 and the version of both essays in Vol. 2 of Owen and Smyser’s <title level="m">Prose Works</title>.</note> Unconcerned with leaving his copy of the 1810 letterpress 
                        pristine, Wordsworth hand-wrote many of his revisions directly into the bound set he had received from 
                        Wilkinson (fig. 10).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Based on evidence he deems “neither abundant nor direct, 
                            but sufficient,” Reed suggests Wordsworth was “very probably back at work on a guide again, motivated by 
                            financial objectives, around November 1812” (<title level="m">Middle Years</title>, 673–75).</note> Besides 
                        cutting several lengthy passages and expunging all references to Wilkinson and his etchings, Wordsworth retitled 
                        his essay “A Topographical Description of the Country of the Lakes in the North of England,” combined “Section I” 
                        and “Section II” from the first edition, and added new passages on the gracefulness and beauty of the Lakes, 
                        travelers’ typical reactions to the region’s mountains, and the damage “improvers” had recently inflicted upon 
                        estates at Derwentwater and Windermere (fig. 11).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For more details on

                        prefatory note justifying the essay’s publication in <title level="m">The River Duddon</title> volume on the 
                        grounds of its “having been written in the same spirit” as his poems and “a belief that it [would] materially 
                        illustrate” his verses. Similar encouragement to read his “Topographical Description” of the Lakes in tandem with 
                        his verse appears in the essay itself, which routinely illustrates key points with quotations from Wordsworth’s 
                        poetry.</p>

               <p>Even though sales for <title level="m">The River Duddon</title> proved unremarkable, it became Wordsworth’s 
                        most extensively reviewed book to date, and those reviewers who noticed the “Topographical Description” were 
                        unfailingly positive.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Of the 500 copies printed in 1820, 340 sold in the first

                        essay into a full-fledged guidebook for Lake District travelers (fig. 12). The stand-alone third edition, 
                        titled <title level="m">A Description of the Scenery in the North of England</title>, appeared in June 1822 as 
                        a portable octavo that was widely advertised and reasonably priced at 5s. 6d. New traveler-friendly features 
                        included a fold-out map, notes on the climate, “Directions and Information for the Tourist,” and an account of 
                        an ascent up Scafell Pike that, while written by Dorothy, appears as if by her brother. Wordsworth also added 
                        a section comparing his native region’s mountains and the Alps as part of a larger effort to “reconcile a Briton 
                        to the scenery of his own country, though not at the expense of truth.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                        commercial formula, as the 1822 guidebook sold as rapidly as any Wordsworth title to date, save 
                        <title level="m">Peter Bell</title> (1819), with the 500-copy print run selling out in a year.</p>

               <p>Rather than simply reissuing the successful 1822 edition, Wordsworth chose yet again to revise and expand his text 
                        for the next edition that appeared in June 1823. Retaining his title from 1822, this fourth edition added 5,400 
                        words of content, including further comparisons of the Lake District and the Alps and new passages on water 
                        birds, weather patterns, and the distinctive glories of the four seasons in the Lakes. By far the longest 
                        addition, however, was another of Dorothy’s unpublished travel accounts, this one chronicling the siblings’ 
                        1805 excursion to Ullswater. Adding yet another chapter to the history of ghost-writing in the 
                        <title level="m">Guide</title>, Wordsworth appended this new account to the Scafell Pike narrative he had 
                        borrowed from Dorothy in 1822 and presented both as his own work. Even with these supplemental features, the 
                        thousand-copy print run for the 1823 edition proved overly optimistic. With hundreds of copies on hand after 
                        the initial sales wave, Wordsworth’s publisher, Longman, would end up advertising this as a “New Edition” of 
                        Wordsworth’s guidebook near the beginning of every summer travel season between 1823 and 1833 (fig. 13).<note place="foot" resp="editors">See, for instance, advertisements in the

               <p>After finally clearing out his stock of the 1823 edition in 1835, Longman understandably had little appetite for 
                        a new edition.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Wordsworth netted an underwhelming £62.12.10 from the 1,500 copies 
                            of the 1822 and 1823 editions. Longman’s account books show 468 copies of the <title level="m">Guide</title> 
                            selling in 1822, 113 in 1824, and 169 in 1825. Excepting 1829, when 120 copies sold, the publisher moved 
                            between 33 and 85 per year between 1826 and 1835. The unusual interest in the <title level="m">Guide</title> 
                            well after its release speaks, in part, to its perceived utility. Most of Wordsworth’s poetry collections 
                            sold several hundred copies in the first two years but fewer than ten copies per year thereafter. See Owen, 
                            <title level="a">Cost, Sales, and Profits,</title> 103.</note> The now 65-year-old Wordsworth, however, was 
                        keen on one last revision of his “Little Book on the Lakes” and sensed that, partly owing to his growing public 
                        stature as a poet, an updated edition would find an audience. Hudson and Nicholson, regional publishers based in 
                        nearby Kendal, shared this view and in short order signed on to replace Longman for the fifth edition. 
                        Explicitly targeting the Lake District traveler, the new publishers rechristened the book <title level="m">A 
                            Guide through the District of the Lakes in the North of England</title> and advertised its 25 July 1835 
                        release exclusively in local newspapers (figs. 14 and 15).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Compared to the 
                            £30 Longman spent on nationwide advertisements for the 1823 edition, Wordsworth’s new publishers set aside 
                            a minuscule £3.14 for advertising the fifth edition. Hudson reported to Wordsworth having advertised the 
                            new edition in six small-town Cumbrian newspapers: the <title level="j">Carlisle Journal</title>, 
                            <title level="j">Carlisle Patriot</title>, <title level="j">Kendal Gazette</title>, <title level="j">Kendal

                                    103 and 106.</note> For his part, Wordsworth added ten new paragraphs to the beginning of his 
                        “Directions and Information for the Tourist” and moved this section from the back of the book to the front. 
                        Lest the intent of such alterations be lost on its imagined audience, Hudson and Nicholson’s ads highlighted 
                        how, “in a concise style,” Wordsworth had laid out “the best and most convenient order of visiting the Lakes.” 
                        Better yet, “An Itinerary of Excursions has been added by the Publishers, which will be found of great advantage 
                        to Tourists.”</p>

               <p>As might be expected, rebranding the <title level="m">Guide</title> as a locally manufactured and distributed 
                        product designed for provincial customers had a chilling effect on sales in the metropolis. Having stayed on as 
                        the new edition’s London distributor, Longman sold a mere 164 copies between 1835 and 1843. Within the Lake 
                        District, however, the fifth edition enjoyed robust sales. Enclosing a royalty check for £29.17.10, Hudson 
                        reported to Wordsworth that, as of 27 September 1838, only 433 of the 1,500 copies printed in 1835 remained 
                        unsold. Imagining unflagging interest in the years ahead, the publisher suggested, “We should be happy to consult 
                        with you sometime when we are at Ambleside on the expediency of having a new &amp; more correct map of the Lake 
                        District, and also of extending the directions to Tourists in the next Edition, which we think would materially

               <head>VI. Writing the Lake District</head>
               <p>Content at last to leave his essay be, Wordsworth demurred on Hudson’s request for another revision. He would, 
                        however, assist the publishers with “Hudson’s <title level="m">Guide</title>,” the 1842 edition that paired his 
                        and Adam Sedgwick’s studies of the Lakes. Together, this new edition and the tourist-friendly version of 1835 
                        brought into sharp relief the <title level="m">Guide</title>’s previously underappreciated engagement with 
                        earlier landmarks of Lake District travel writing. While people had long lived and labored in the region, before 
                        the mid-eighteenth century the lakes and mountains of England’s northwest attracted few leisure travelers. In fact, 
                        the topography of the Lake District struck many as more forbidding than inviting. Daniel Defoe, writing in the 
                        1720s, claimed that the region was “eminent only for being the wildest, most barren and frightful of any that I 
                        have passed over in England.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Daniel Defoe, <title level="m"> A Tour thro’ the

                            The most comprehensive survey of early books on Lake Country topography remains Peter Bicknell’s

                            (Winchester: St. Paul’s Bibliographies, 1990). For how Wordsworth’s expanding popularity influenced the 
                            development of Victorian travel literature, see Saeko Yoshikawa’s <title level="m">William Wordsworth and 
                                the Invention of Tourism, 1820–1900</title> (Burlington: Ashgate, 2014), esp. 225–41.</note> By the time 
                        Wordsworth reached adulthood, however, his native Lake District had become one of the most popular landscape 
                        subjects for writers and artists in the British Isles and increasingly a destination for tourists. The Wordsworths 
                        and other locals without an economic stake in the annual summer influx began derisively referring to these 
                        travelers as “Lakers.” At the close of one especially heavy tourism season, an exhausted Dorothy Wordsworth 
                        wrote on 18 October 1825, “I think we had the last of our Lakers on Sunday.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <title level="m">Letters</title>, 4:393. “Laker” had been in use since at least 1798, when

                            tourism and the fashion for botany. In 1805, Windermere resident Richard Watson, Bishop of Llandaff, explained 
                            to a friend that “<title level="m">Lakers</title>” was “the denomination by which we distinguish those who 
                            come to see our country.” More specifically, he suggested, it was reserved for “idle persons who love 
                            <emph>laking</emph>” (<title level="m">Anecdotes of the Life of Richard Watson</title>, 2 vols. [London:

               <p>Like many landscapes prized by latter-day travelers, this one had remained comparatively unspoiled because 
                            earlier generations found it resistant to large-scale cultivation, difficult to traverse, and prone to 
                            unpleasant weather. It was not until modernity arrived, with its sprawling populations and rapid 
                            transportation networks, that Britons began to value “wilderness” for its contrasting spiritual 
                            resources.<note place="foot" resp="editors">We put “wilderness” in quotes because, as Wordsworth was well 
                                aware, the Lake District was hardly an untouched preserve, even before eighteenth-century tourists took 
                                interest in it. Humans had long inhabited and shaped the region. For Wordsworth, then, preserving the 
                                landscape meant holding on to and enhancing its character as produced by traditional ways of life and the 
                                mediating power of taste. Throughout the <title level="m">Guide</title>, readers find significant tension 
                                between “nature” and “culture.” Several scholars listed in our annotated bibliography have addressed this 
                                tension and other complications attending Wordsworth’s environmentalism.</note> In old age, Wordsworth 
                            recalled a Keswick landlady of his youth who lamented, “Bless me! folk are always talking about prospects: 
                            when I was young there was never sic a thing neamed!”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Wordsworth,

                            to natural scenery, Wordsworth emerged at an ideal moment for capturing nature’s glories in prose and verse. 
                            By 1825, he had come claim that his “wish” in writing the <title level="m">Guide</title> was “to teach the

               <p>Various imperatives drove the popularization of scenic terrains like those found among the lakes and fells of 
                        Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire. One was national: the so-called “discovery of Britain” reflected a 
                        desire to domesticate the continental Grand Tour, the rite of passage that functioned as the culmination of a 
                        gentleman’s education. The growth of home tourism in the eighteenth century was accelerated both by economic 
                        constraints and European wars. Turning their energies inward, then, by necessity as well as inclination, British 
                        tourists, artists, and travel writers self-consciously went about demarcating their own nation’s classic ground, 
                        including the lesser-known but increasingly romanticized landscapes of Northern England, Scotland, and Wales.</p>
               <p>Wordsworth thus participated in a broader cultural phenomenon when comparing the Lakeland fells to the Alps and 
                        desiring to “reconcile a Briton to the scenery of his own country” 
                        (<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.1835.html#para106">para. 106</ref>). 
                        While this nativizing project took on fresh urgency during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, it was a 
                        movement long in the making. The early promotion of British landscape had its paradoxical aspects—for instance, 
                        drawing on continental codes of art to celebrate domestic beauties. Yet it set the stage for the time when 
                        tourists would hunger to range over British territory defined as heritage landscape, sped along by expanding 
                        economic opportunity, leisure, and transportation improvements. It is no wonder that most historians of British 
                        travel date the birth of modern tourism to roughly 1750, as this moment witnessed not only the birth of Lake 
                        District literature but also the earliest stirrings of the cult of the picturesque. By the dawn of the Romantic 
                        period, conditions were firmly in place for a boom in British home tourism.</p>
               <p>Wordsworth both reflects and capitalizes on these trends in the <title level="m">Guide</title>. Repeatedly noting 
                        changes from “within the last sixty years,” he defines a period that wraps his <title level="m">Guide</title>’s 
                        concerns into the history of tourism.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See especially the opening of “Section 
                            Third” in the 1835 edition. In the first edition of 1810, Wordsworth had spoken of events from “within the 
                            last forty years,” making 1770, his birth year, the point of departure. This blurring of regional history 
                            and his own lifespan connected the <title level="m">Guide</title> and the landscape it celebrates to the 
                            biographical myth underlying Wordsworth’s poetic project (see Gill, <title level="m">Life</title>, 285).</note> 
                        The rise of landscape-hunger, with its associated art and literature, fueled tourist traffic that would transform 
                        the Lake District both environmentally and socially. It also encouraged more affluent people to move to or 
                        purchase second homes in the region. Arguably, Wordsworth himself chose to settle in the heart of the Lake 
                        District not only because it was his childhood home and the repository of personal memories but also because it 
                        was rich aesthetic territory. Now, in both the <title level="m">Guide</title> and his poetry, he was taking stock 
                        of the changes that had occurred in his native region, celebrating some but more often sounding defensive and 
                        elegiac notes. While singing the beauties of a place, he also aimed to define and protect it.</p>
               <p>Despite enduring myths surrounding Wordsworth and his fellow poets’ “discovery” of the Lake District, it had in 
                        fact been widely promoted in print and painting since the 1750s, most prominently in studies by William 
                        Hutchinson (1774), Thomas Gray (1775), Thomas West (1778), William Gilpin (1786), and James Clarke (1787).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For a comprehensive history of Lake District literature prior to Wordsworth, see

                                Study</title> (Winchester: St. Paul’s Bibliographies, 1990).</note> By the late eighteenth century, works 
                        by these and other writers were commonly read, toted about, and recycled (that is, cited, imitated, or plagiarized 
                        outright). Moreover, Lake Country tours were fast becoming the target of satires, as in James Plumptre’s 
                        <title level="m">The Lakers</title> (1798) and William Combe and Thomas Rowlandson’s <title level="m">The Tour of

                        form firm opinions, Wordsworth engaged the tradition directly. While, with his lyrical prose and intimate knowledge 
                        of the landscape, Wordsworth easily outshines most earlier writers, parts of the <title level="m">Guide</title> 
                        might have seemed mildly derivative to readers well versed in, say, Gilpin’s strictures against white objects 
                        disrupting sight lines, West’s characterization of the Lake region as a miniature version of the Alps, and 
                        countless commentaries on the use of color and form in landscapes.</p>

               <p>The first influential promoters of the region’s scenery were visual artists, but just behind them came the writers 
                        who established foundations for literature on the region. One was John Dalton of Queen’s College, Oxford, who 
                        published <title level="m">A Descriptive Poem Addressed to Two Young Ladies at Their Return from Viewing the Mines 
                            Near Whitehaven</title> in 1755; another was John Brown of St John’s, Cambridge, whose glowing letter on the 
                        Vale of Keswick (written in the early 1750s but first published in 1767) described the area’s scenery in terms 
                        of “the united powers of Claude, Salvator, and Poussin” and attracted many aspiring artists and 
                        scenery-hounds.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                        it was fitting that they should be the first of the “long line of dons and divines who were to record the 
                        Lakes.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Bicknell, <title level="m">Picturesque Scenery</title>, 1.</note> 
                        Acknowledging such pioneers in the <title level="m">Guide</title>, Wordsworth singled out Brown, calling him “one 
                        of the first who led the way to a worthy admiration of this country”

               <p>Even before Wordsworth’s birth, Brown’s letter had found its way into the hands of Thomas Gray and convinced the 
                        famous poet to turn tourist. Gray, best known for his <title level="a">Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard</title> 
                        (1751), made his tour of the Lakes in 1769, two years before his eventual death and fifteen months before 
                        Wordsworth’s birth. Having left a sick traveling companion behind, he kept a careful journal that was first printed 
                        in William Mason’s <title level="m">The Poems of Mr. Gray</title> (1775). Gray’s journal fully entered the canon of 
                        Lakeland literature, however, when republished as an addendum to the second edition of Thomas West’s popular 
                        <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> (1780). Though Gray’s account was often parodied for such superheated 
                        descriptions as that of the “Jaws of Borrowdale,” Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title> praises its prevailing 
                        “distinctness and unaffected simplicity” 
                        (<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.1835.html#para73">para. 73</ref>).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Wordsworth here echoed the influential editor of West’s <title level="m">Guide</title>, William 
                            Cockin, who admitted that Gray’s journal offered little of what readers might call “fine writing” but insisted 
                            that those who prized trustworthy description and “elegant simplicity of narrative” would consider it a welcome 
                            companion to their travels (in West, <title level="m">A Guide to the Lakes</title>, 2nd ed. [London: Richardson 
                            and Urquhart, 1780], 199).</note> Notwithstanding his earlier critiques of Gray’s poetic diction in the 
                        <title level="a">Preface to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>,</title> Wordsworth found in him a kindred 
                        spirit, a poet of an earlier generation exploring places he now knew and loved. Gray’s journal contained several 
                        passages that Wordsworth would especially approve, such as when he calls Grasmere Vale, Wordsworth’s future home, “a 
                        little unexpected paradise.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Gray, quoted in Thomas West, <title level="m">A Guide

                        also rightly saw Gray’s journal as a major impetus for the growth of Lakeland tourism, attributing its sway in part 
                        to “the pensive interest with which the human mind is ever disposed to listen to the farewell words of genius”

               <p>Alongside Gray, the most important figures in the background of Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title> were 
                        West and the Reverend William Gilpin. Although unpublished until 1786, Gilpin’s <title level="m">Observations 
                            Relative Chiefly to Picturesque Beauty</title> had circulated broadly in manuscript since 1772 and gained 
                        significant influence. More instruction manual than tour guide, Gilpin’s treatise served as a touchstone for 
                        Wordsworth in the <title level="m">Guide</title> and elsewhere, clearly informing his theories of and vocabulary 
                        for describing the picturesque, though Wordsworth resisted Gilpin’s painterly perspective. Wordsworth’s most 
                        consistent interlocutor in his essay on the Lakes, however, is West, whose own <title level="m">A Guide to the 
                            Lakes</title> (1778) was the undisputed classic on the subject. Before writing his guidebook, West had 
                        already established himself as an authority on the region with <title level="m">The Antiquities of Furness</title> 
                        (1774), and, recognizing that Lake tourism was accelerating, he set out to fill a need. Just how successful 
                        West’s <title level="m">Guide</title> had proven in this aim is evidenced by its going into an eleventh edition 
                        in 1821, the year before Wordsworth’s essay first appeared in a stand-alone volume.</p>
               <p>Sensibly organized, clear, detailed, and engaging throughout, West’s catalog of the wonders of the Lake District 
                        quickly won admirers. Wordsworth frequently alludes to it approvingly in his <title level="m">Guide</title>, 
                        noting at one point how this earlier “Guide to the Lakes has been eminently serviceable to the Tourist for nearly

                        The first few pages of West’s book indicate its character. 
                        Its epigraph, taken from Milton’s description of Eden, announces a treatise on “A happy rural seat of various 
                        views,” and such “views” of England’s Northern Arcadia would quickly emerge as the work’s main emphasis. Perhaps 
                        most famously, West recommends a series of viewing stations best suited to use of a “landscape mirrors,” or the 
                        “Claude glasses” popular with Gray and other educated travelers whose expectations had been shaped by landscape 
                        art (fig. 17).<note place="foot" resp="editors">West, <title level="m">A Guide to the Lakes</title> (London:

                            landscape sketchers. The device took its name from Claude Lorrain, the seventeenth-century French artist 
                            whose visions of Arcadia heavily shaped British theories of the picturesque. The glass could frame and tint 
                            the landscape so that it resembled one of Claude’s paintings. (Courtesy: Victoria and Albert Museum,

               <p>After its author’s 1779 death, West’s <title level="m">Guide</title> gradually morphed into an anthology of Lake 
                        District writing in the second (1780) and third (1784) editions overseen by William Cockin (figs. 18 and 19). 
                        Filling some hundred pages of the three hundred-page book, Cockin’s “Addenda” offered a chronologically organized 
                        survey of writing on the Lakes since the 1750s. The collection as a whole treated literary descriptions, 
                        especially poems, as fundamental aides to appreciating the region’s landscapes, inspiring Wordsworth and a host 
                        of others to take up the rhapsodic pen themselves. In the wake of these expanded editions of West’s <title level="m">Guide</title>, composing a suitable panegyric became an important aspect of travel to the Lakes 
                        and writing verse became a cognate to amateur sketching.</p>

               <p>West and his early readers therefore launched a process that the Lake Poets, especially Wordsworth, would 
                        complete, converting the Lake District into a poetic landscape. By framing the region as a series of poems and pictures 
                        and establishing codes for admiring such pictures, West and his contemporaries set patterns that Lake District 
                        tourism still follows in many respects, though catering now to travelers with digital cameras. Nearly 250 years 
                        after West, tourists may still visit some of his viewing “stations,” including most famously Claife Station on 
                        the western shore of Windermere (fig. 20).</p>

               <head>VII. The Originality of Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title>
               </head>
               <p>Clearly, then, Wordsworth did not write in a vacuum, as his essay on the Lakes was highly informed by earlier 
                        guides. Nonetheless, it was novel in several respects. Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title> 
                        embraced the creed that animated his verses, broadcasting his ideals in editions increasingly geared toward the 
                        general reader who might never have taken to his poetry. As witnessed in our 
                        <ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.annotated_bib.html">annotated bibliography</ref>, 
                        commentators on the <title level="m">Guide</title> have long emphasized its uniquely “Wordsworthian” traits. 
                        Whereas earlier guidebooks had typically assumed the tourist’s point of view, Wordsworth’s convinces us its 
                        author has walked all of the region’s paths in all sorts of weather. He belongs to the place almost as much as do 
                        the trees, rocks, lichens, and waterfalls. Characteristically, he blends a native’s matter-of-factness with a 
                        sense of persistent wonder and dignified reverence.</p>
               <p>Wordsworth also goes beyond the conventional practice of travel handbooks in his range of arguments. As Ian 
                        Ousby suggests, the <title level="m">Guide</title> “makes most [earlier travel books] seem ‘two-dimensional’ by 
                        its larger, more rounded approach to its subject, treating landscape not as a special effect to be sought out and 
                        appreciated in isolation but connecting it to the region’s geology, history, and human culture.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Ian Ousby, <title level="m">The Englishman’s England</title> (London: Cambridge UP, 1990), 
                            138–39.</note> Upon completing the <title level="a">Introduction</title> to <title level="m">Select 
                                Views</title>, Wordsworth explained to Lady Beaumont on 10 May 1810 that he aspired to “give a model of 
                        the manner in which topographical descriptions ought to be executed . . . by evolving truly and distinctly one 
                        appearance from another” (<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.letters.html#letter6">letter 
                            6</ref>).<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:404.</note> Honoring this 
                        original intent, all iterations of the <title level="m">Guide</title> insist that travelers experience the Lake 
                        District as it unfolds itself gradually to the pedestrian. Against the tradition of viewing the region merely as 
                        a series of discrete viewing stations, Wordsworth presents it as a whole that takes its charms from interconnection 
                        and gradual transition, both physical and temporal. The Lake District may offer no single feature superior to, say, 
                        a high peak in the Alps, but as a compact <emph>whole</emph>, it compares favorably with any terrain in the world. 
                        Embodying Coleridge’s concept of beauty as “multeity in unity,” the region is a poem in which the parts take their 
                        meaning from the overall scheme. This understanding has ecological significance. All aspects of Lake Country 
                        life—aesthetic, meteorological, social, agricultural, geological, biological—are taken to be interrelated.</p>
               <p>Even in radically repurposing what began as the prose supplement to an esoteric art series into a portable traveler’s 
                        companion, Wordsworth never saw himself writing a mere guidebook. Straightaway in the 1835 edition he begrudges the 
                        “humble and tedious task” of providing directions for tourists, aspiring instead to influence “the 
                        <emph>Minds</emph> of Persons of taste, and a feeling for Landscape,” sensitive souls prepared to watch and 
                        receive with uncommon attention 
                        (<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.1835.html#para1">para. 1</ref>). 
                        Tellingly, the word “guide” never 
                        appeared in the work’s title until it became important to Hudson and Nicholson’s marketing of the fifth 
                        edition. <title level="m">Description</title>, Wordsworth’s chosen label for the second, third, and fourth 
                        editions, was in ways more accurate, though the <title level="m">Guide</title> never confines its task to merely 
                        “describing” the region.</p>
               <p>Another feature distinguishing Wordsworth’s essay from its forerunners is the pioneering case it makes for preserving 
                        the ecological, aesthetic, and social health of the Lake District. Even while promoting the region’s charms, it 
                        conveys a fear that newcomers may love the region to death. As noted above, Wordsworth writes as a Lake District 
                        local, but he also writes <emph>to</emph> locals—especially to wealthy landowners who have recently arrived. The 
                        title page of the 1835 edition advertises this as a book “for the use of Tourists and Residents,” and all 
                        stand-alone versions included the bluntly subtitled section on “Changes, and Rules of Taste for Preventing their 
                        Bad Effects.” Whether descanting on the ideal color for homes, the traditional shape of vernacular chimneys, or 
                        the sensible placement of trees, Wordsworth often takes a view that transcends the limits of private property. 
                        He argues that, in a special moral sense, the countryside belongs to everyone, regardless of who might legally own 
                        a particular corner of it. Most famously, his pronouncement that the Lake District should be regarded as “a sort 
                        of national property, in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy” 
                        (<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.1835.html#para93">para. 93</ref>) offers an original 
                        vision for the idea of the national 
                        park.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On Wordsworth as founding figure for national parks, see Stephen Gill,

                        Park, the largest designated region in England and now a UNESCO World Heritage site. As Peter Bicknell suggests, 
                        “whether we agree with [Wordsworth] or not, he has fundamentally changed the way we all look at the natural 
                        world.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Bicknell, <title level="m">Illustrated Wordsworth’s Guide to the

               </p>
               <p>In gradually reworking and repurposing his <title level="m">Guide</title>, Wordsworth came to consider it less  
                        an autonomous work than part of his larger literary and philosophical project. Where other topographical writers 
                        might refer to a painting, Wordsworth usually quotes poetry, not infrequently his own.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Julia S. Carlson, <title level="a">

                        <title level="m">Guide</title>, he imports verse not merely for vanity or ornamentation; rather, he grasps for the most 
                        evocative language at hand, whether in the form of a lyric, a passage from the <title level="m">Excursion</title>, 
                        or a few lines from such unpublished works as “Home at Grasmere” or <title level="m">The Prelude</title>. In so 
                        doing, Wordsworth insists that poetry is an authoritative mode of description. His quotations become both 
                        illustrations and occasions for heightened focus. Sometimes they also model emotional reactions, encouraging 
                        readers to translate the writer’s observations into the realms of personal sensation and reflection.</p>
               <p>Within the larger history of travel writing, the <title level="m">Guide</title> also expands the trend of blending poetry with topographical 
                        prose. By Victorian times, this potent combination would not only make reading poetry essential to travelers’ 
                        landscape explorations but would also produce a thoroughly literary geography, converting the Lake District into 
                        the “Wordsworthshire” of literary tourists.<note place="foot" resp="editors">“Wordsworthshire” seems to have been 
                            coined by Harvard professor James Russell Lowell (see the unsigned biographical sketch he contributed 
                            to <title level="m">The Poetical Works of William Wordsworth</title> [7 vols., Boston: Little, Brown, and 
                            Company, 1854, xxxviii], material later reworked as <title level="a">Wordsworth</title> in 
                            <title level="m">Among My Books</title>, 2nd Series [Boston: James R. Osgood, 1876, 240]). However, the term 
                            is essentially synonymous with “Wordsworth Country” and other common designations of the Lake District’s 
                            literary landscape that developed across the nineteenth and into the early twentieth century. Compare 
                            “Scott-land,” “Burns Country,” and similar inventions of the Victorian travel and literary heritage 
                            industries.</note> After all, Wordsworth’s self-quotation performs anthology-making functions, making it 
                        difficult to disentangle the long-range impact of his <title level="m">Guide</title> from the reverberations of 
                        his poems. In the end, Wordsworth, his verses, and the terrain he celebrated became inseparable in the public 
                        imagination. The increasing popularity of Wordsworth’s poetry from the 1820s through the 1840s mirrored, and 
                        probably owed something to, the growing accessibility of the Lake District as tourist terrain. Meanwhile, this 
                        tourism, abetted by marketing savvy on the poet’s and his publishers’ parts, helped consolidate Wordsworth’s 
                        Victorian authorial persona.</p>
               <p>Considering the wide-ranging impact the <title level="m">Guide</title> has had on literary and environmental 
                        thought over its first two-plus centuries, there’s ample cause for gratitude that Joseph Wilkinson turned up in 
                        the spring of 1809 with an offer that at last persuaded Wordsworth to overcome his anxieties about doing justice to 
                        “a theme so boundless and sublime as this beautiful region” 
                        (<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.letters.html#letter2">letter 2</ref>).<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                        earliest incarnation, the resulting essay still impresses with its earnest affection for its subject. There are moments 
                        in the <title level="m">Guide</title> when the literature of knowledge modulates into the literature of power: striking 
                        metaphors; accounts of the "magical" effects of reflection, light and mist; expeditions into the clouds; and even 
                        excursions back in time. Other passages dwell on the small and often overlooked—lichens, wildflowers, ferns, 
                        gravel. Such descriptions capture in prose the “poetry of nature” for which Wordsworth remains beloved. In short, the book 
                        promotes "imagination," defined by Wordsworth in his note to <title level="a">The Thorn</title> as “the faculty which 
                        produces impressive effects out of simple elements.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">The “poetry of nature” phrase 
                            originates in Coleridge’s account of the genesis of <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>: “During the first year that Mr. Wordsworth 
                            and I were neighbours, our conversations turned frequently on the two cardinal points of poetry, the power of 
                            exciting the sympathy of the reader by a faithful adherence to the truth of nature, and the power of giving the 
                            interest of novelty by the modifying colours of imagination. The sudden charm, which accidents of light and shade, 
                            which moonlight or sunset diffused over a known and familiar landscape, appeared to represent the practicability 
                            of combining both. These are the poetry of nature” (<title level="m">Biographia Literaria</title>, [London: Rest

               <p>Of course, the history of the <title level="m">Guide</title>’s influence hardly ends with the editions published 
                        during his lifetime. Victorian guidebooks commonly referenced it, so that many of its principles, absorbed and 
                        ultimately taken for granted, came to affect readers indirectly. Lake District tourism and its associated 
                        literature continued to grow rapidly after the poet’s death, encouraged by improved transportation to the 
                        gateway towns, the emergence of photography, and the unflagging enthusiasm of many writers, walkers, tour 
                        promoters, artists, and conservationists, notable Wordsworthians among them. While Wordsworth would have been 
                        pleased by the expansion of his reputation and influence, he likely would have felt some discomfort about the 
                        commercialization of “Wordsworth Country.” Late in his life, he had famously protested the construction of the 
                        Kendal and Windermere Railway, fearing that mass tourism would degrade the Lake District’s “character of 
                        seclusion and retirement.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">See his letters to the <title level="j">Morning 
                            Post</title>, published together in slightly revised and expanded form as the pamphlet <title level="m">Kendal 
                                and Windermere Railway: Two Letters Re-printed from <title level="j">The Morning Post</title>
                     </title> 
                            (1844), 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Yet, despite the irony of a man so skeptical of tourism writing 
                        a guidebook, Wordsworth had a lifelong passion for introducing others to the beauties of his native region and 
                        a growing awareness of how his works helped produce the demand for tourist infrastructure. While his second 
                        railway letter reminded the coming hordes that “there are temples of Nature, temples built by the Almighty, 
                        which have . . . claim to be left unviolated,” he never expected or desired to keep the Lakes to 
                        himself.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <title level="m">Kendal and Windermere Railway</title>, 19.</note> In 
                        candid moments he may even have appreciated the synchronicity of the railway and his appointment as Poet 
                        Laureate arriving together in the 1840s. He would now have to accept the crowds at Windermere along with his fan 
                        mail and the pilgrims finding their way to Rydal Mount—all natural consequences of an appreciative 
                        readership. <title level="m">The Guide</title> thus leaves us with a paradox, and it may be said to have come up 
                        short in some of its rhetorical aims. Still, signs of the impact of Wordsworth’s taste-shaping efforts, his 
                        conservation ethic, and his love of nature abound even now in the Lake District and beyond.</p>

                accompanied by Wordsworth’s letters on the Kendal and Windermere Railway. This
                edition has no footnotes besides Wordsworth’s own and offers just seven “Notes and
                Illustrations” at the volume’s end. Essentially, then, it offers only a clean
                reading text, but it sets a precedent for more thorough scholarly treatments.

           Building on the work of Grosart, Knight produces a chronological edition of
                Wordsworth’s prose writings. Volume 2 begins with the <title level="m">Guide</title>,
                for which Knight prefers the earlier title, <title level="m">Description of the
                    Scenery of the Lakes</title>. Using the 1835 edition as his copy text, Knight
                annotates the work with basic information on the <title level="m">Guide</title>’s
                textual history and references to relevant passages in Wordsworth’s poetry. As such,
                Knight’s is the first in a line of scholarly editions that runs through de
                Sélincourt through Owen and Smyser to the current electronic edition.

                component of the <title level="m">Guide</title>, noting how Wordsworth uses his birth
                year (1770) as the moment at which the Lake District and its culture began quickly

                on the <title level="m">Guide</title>. “Instead of a guide,” he writes, Wordsworth
                “presented the world with a treatise on the picturesque, the sublime, and the
                beautiful. It is needless to say, that his treatise overflows with fine and true
                thoughts and observations; nor does any man living better understand, or more deeply
                feel, the characteristic qualities of the scenery of Westmoreland. Yet it is
                somewhat heavy, even as a philosophical essay.” He goes on to opine that such guides
                are perhaps best written by non-natives of a region, who might offer a more
                “impartial and reasonable work” (264).</p>

                fauna to life. Symington is perhaps most impressed by Wordsworth’s depiction of “the
                inhabitants of the Dales, with their homesteads and manner of living.” In this
                respect, it is “quite a model, and probably the most accurate and interesting thing
                of the kind ever written.” He concludes his section on the <title level="m">Guide
                </title>by speculating on the economic impact of Wordsworth’s writing on the region:
                “there is not an inn or small farmhouse in all the Lake Country which does not reap
                in hard coin the results” (2:53-54).</p>

                practical” (225). Campbell’s main concern, though, is bibliographical, as he

                friend.” Woolf claims that, unlike writers chiefly concerned about stylistic
                flourishes or literary fashions, Wordsworth wrote his <title level="m">Guide</title>
                with authority and logic. She admires his intricate knowledge of the area and his
                insistence on spiritual richness and systematic order within the natural world.
                Compared with the ornate word-sketches in Rawnsley’s <title level="m">Months at the
                    Lakes</title>, Wordsworth’s descriptions ring with solemn but imaginative honesty.
                “There are few,” she writes, “who would not seem to write diluted English after the

                from his predecessors, Wordsworth was deeply influenced by picturesque writers and
                theorists such as William Gilpin, Uvedale Price, and Thomas West. While Wordsworth
                aimed to refine prevailing tastes and perceptual habits, he largely worked within

                (assembled with the assistance of Robert Woof and Peter Bicknell) explores the
                “public life” of the Lake District from the eighteenth century to the present. Pages
                77–91 treat Wordsworth specifically, with one short section, “Wordsworth as Guide,”
                arguing not only that the <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> “became the
                standard work on the visual qualities of the Lake District” (80), but, more
                importantly, that it inaugurated a crucial shift “from critical pictorialism to a
                sense of responsibility for [the landscape’s] right development and careful
                conservation” (80). This shift would become decisive in English culture. In
                connection with this discussion, the authors also foreground Wordsworth’s interests
                in landscape design and gardening, urging readers not to overlook “this side of
                Wordsworth’s nature,” which so clearly drove the ethics of the <title level="m">Guide</title>.</p>

                the larch greatly, and can only suppose that he had seen none but immature
                specimens, and in those close plantations which are necessary for economic forestry”

                        <p rend="noCount">In her chapter on “Archeologies,” Kelley argues that Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title> privileges two aesthetic arguments. First, Wordsworth
                endorses the Coleridgean definition of beauty as “Multeity in Unity.” Second, and
                more radically, he suggests that the beautiful is a natural progression and
                completion of the sublime. Kelley argues that Wordsworth’s reckoning of sublimity as
                inherently deficient, primordial, and precursory to the beautiful is evident in the
                way he stratifies the topography and history of the Lake District. This
                stratification, according to Kelley, reflects Wordsworth’s attempts to map out the
                workings of his own imagination. </p>

                eighteenth-century writer and critic, as a predecessor to Thomas Gray and William
                Wordsworth. The article focuses specifically on Brown’s posthumously published poem
                “Night Scene in the Vale of Keswick,” which was first published in 1776 and
                subsequently reprinted in the 1835 edition of Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title>. Roberts suggests that while Brown likely found his poem unsuitable
                for publication because of its suppressed romantic quality, the poem provided a
                seminal “modern” description of mountain scenery that inspired writers like Thomas
                Gray and Wordsworth. In fact, Robert asserts that both Gray and Wordsworth attempted
                to recreate Brown’s alpine experience and imitated his style.</p>

                Gigante posits that the <title level="m">Guide</title> attempts to distinguish the
                elevated “feeding mind” that can appropriate and order the material world through
                imagination from a mind of “bad taste” that is driven by merely consumerist
                impulses. Wordsworth, she argues, finds himself caught between models of
                consumption, and his struggle helps explain the irony of his complaining about the
                incursions of tourists and trains even while writing guidebooks for visitors.</p>

                        <label>Ottum argues that Wordsworth is concerned with both describing the characteristics of
                a particular setting—the things that make up a place’s essence—and situating this
                place in reference to “scenic settings abroad.” In this sense, the localist focus of
                the <title level="m">Guide</title> is not “anti-urban” so much as it is a response to
                shifts in globalization and the emergence of mass tourism. While eighteenth-and
                early nineteenth-century tourism encouraged travelers to discover similarities
                between “picturesque” environments, the <title level="m">Guide</title> distinguishes
                the Lake District from foreign places of sublime or picturesque interest.</label>

                (260). Gill points to Wordsworth’s famous description of the Lake District “as a

                year walk over unenclosed hills, of enjoy access to lake shores, is his greatest,
                and most fitting memorial” (260). </p>

                proposed in the 1870s and completed in the 1890s, provoked one of the first modern
                environmental controversies, pitting “the Victorian icon of nature” (sanctified by
                Wordsworth) against “the Victorian icon of progress” (2–3). This debate was
                remarkable, Ritvo argues, because it hinged on the emerging, radical notion
                (adumbrated by the <title level="m">Guide</title>) that the public, national and even
                transnational, could have interest in a landscape that was privately owned. </p>

                Wainwright published between 1955 and 1966. Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title>, Moseley argues, is written as if the reader physically travels with
                Wordsworth. In its pedestrian sensibility, it anticipates Wainwright’s books for
                fell-walkers. While, like earlier writers in the picturesque tradition, Wordsworth
                privileges valley “views” and “prospects,” he offers a new sense of immersion, a
                feeling for the walker’s route, and a willingness to celebrate hard-earned views
                from above.</p>

                developments in the picturesque representation of the Lakes. In particular, his work
                shows how such representation became increasingly multi-medial, incorporating maps,
                engravings, poems, diagrams, and other tools to define and materialize British
                terrain. Depicting the British landscape cartographically became linked with
                describing it in poetic meter. It is no coincidence, Carlson notes, that
                Wordsworth’s poetry records some of the first cultural responses to the Ordnance
                Survey of Britain, nor that his own <title level="m">Guide</title> came to incorporate
                many different materials “as if they were comparable visual aids to the experience
                of landscape” (88). In fact, Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title> influenced
                the next generation of tour books, which worked to merge art, literature, travel,
                and science.</p>

                discourse, Smethurst highlights textual points in the <title level="m">Guide</title>
                that resonate with writings of other “traveler-scientists.” His interest in the <title level="m">Guide</title> is part of Smethurst’s larger exploration of how
                eighteenth-century and romantic practices in tourism and natural history detached

                competing genres, linked variously with the modern discourses of feeling and fact.
                Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title> enters the essay in its final section,
                serving as a case study of topography’s development. Porter traces the <title level="m">Guide</title>’s transformation through its various editions,
                highlighting Wordsworth’s attempts to reconcile discourses that often competed with
                one another. Ultimately, the edition of 1835 “enhanced the text’s relationship to
                picturesque aesthetics while subsuming (but carefully maintaining) its alignment
                with the representational techniques of physical geography” (175). If
                nineteenth-century poets of place and readers of like spirit preferred the language
                of personal observation and response, Porter argues, they also found authority and
                practical value in the new topography.</p>

                refuge, a source of spiritual renewal” (101). Paradoxically, he remarks, the very
                tourists who visit places like the Lakes for spiritual sustenance often destroy what
                they cherish; Wordsworth himself famously took up these questions. Of the <title level="m">Guide</title> specifically, Ousby writes that, although it was far
                from the first guidebook of its kind, it made earlier efforts seem unliterary and
                incomplete in comparison. Moreover, the <title level="m">Guide</title> cemented
                Wordsworth’s status as a “Lake Poet,” embodying what was finally his greatest impact
                on tourism—namely, the invention of a literary landscape inseparable from the poet’s
                life and work.</p>

                        <p rend="noCount">Buzard’s chapter on “Tourist and Traveller” helps explain how Wordsworth could both
                complain about tourists and write guidebooks for them. Travel literature dealt in
                anti-tourist rhetoric from the start, Buzard contends, because the “tourist” was the
                (supposedly) less cultured, less sophisticated person against whom a true
                “traveller” could define himself. When Wordsworth directed his guidebook to “the <title level="m">Minds</title> of Persons of taste,” he was seeking “readers who would
                live up to the calling of true travellers” (30). Such sensitive beings could visit
                the Lake District without desecrating it. In this context, Buzard describes the <title level="m">Guide</title> as an example of the “anti-guidebook” genre. Buzard
                concludes that Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title> lost much of its
                idiosyncratic flavor when incorporated into Hudson’s <title level="m">Complete
                    Guide</title> of 1842. By that time, travel books based on individual authority
                were beginning to seem obsolete, as the age of the comprehensive Baedecker and
                Murray handbooks had arrived.</p>

                Lake District and ensures that those tourists who read his guidebook will
                vicariously experience the region through his perspective. Ultimately, Labbe
                concludes, Wordsworth wants to create an “undifferentiated Nature, undisturbed by
                detail,” in order to reinforce his self-appointed position as the leading guide to
                the region.</p>

                various essays: Susan Denyer’s meditation on Lakeland as both “nature” and cultural
                artifact; John Walton’s interrogation of the Lakes as a potential <emph>world</emph> heritage site; Melanie Hall’s account of Wordsworth’s transatlantic

                Station (a picturesque viewing spot); and David Cooper’s discussion of the
                “Post-Industrial Picturesque.” Wordsworth thus appears in the guises of pioneer of
                regional geography, environmental preservationist, inspiration for the founders of
                the National Trust, and theorist of a benevolent British empire.</p>

                did not in itself attract a mass readership or serve as direct reference for the
                majority of Victorian tourists who visited the Lakes, it did set terms for
                appreciating the Lake District in a “Wordsworthian” manner and helped define the
                “Lake District” itself as a single destination.</p>

                Thomas elaborates especially on Wordsworth’s aim to guide the <title level="m">minds</title> of his readers. Wordsworth’s authority derives from intimate local

                        <p rend="noCount">Carlson proposes that guidebooks, by quoting illustrative snippets of blank verse,
                helped bring about the Romantic-era naturalization and nationalization of blank
                verse as a lyric form. Whereas other tour writers borrowed poetic descriptions of
                different locales—say, from Milton or Thomson—and applied them to Lake District
                features, Wordsworth included poetry that presented itself as autochthonous. Carlson
                shows how Wordsworth’s quotations in the <title level="m">Guide</title> (1) translate
                the ideas and objects described into the register of individual experience, (2)
                demonstrate “the mind’s penetration by images,” (3) serve as illustrations or
                “verse-pictures,” and (4) institute pauses for contemplation, halting the reader’s
                movement as if enforcing visual attention.</p>

                        <p rend="noCount">For Fulford, Wordsworth’s later work “was neither an escape from history as New
                Historicist critics argued in the 1980s, nor, on any simple level, an ecological
                poetry, as eco-critics suggested in the 1990s, but a topographic writing allied with
                guidebooks and local histories, and preoccupied with the landscape as a place marked
                by the deeds of past Britons—a historicized nationalism” (7). Fulford mentions the
                <title level="m">Guide</title> in this context, contending also that the book in
                its various editions shows Wordsworth taking advantage of new trends in publishing
                and meeting the demands of late-Romantic and Victorian audiences. </p>

               <p>Our aim is to produce a thoroughly annotated and contextualized edition of
                    Wordsworth's "Guide" that will prove useful to students, researchers, and the
                    general public. Our edition will feature complete transcriptions of each
                    iteration of the Guide and highlight key variants across the five editions
                    Wordsworth oversaw during his lifetime. We will also include extensive
                    background information on the Guide including annotations for obscure terms,
                    references, and literary allusions as well as maps and photographs of key
                    locations in England's Lake District. We hope also to include high-resolution
                    scans of the rarely seen Joseph Wilkinson sketches that inspired the Guide‟s
                    original composition.</p>

                  <p rend="noCount">As detailed in this edition’s <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.introduction.html#para8">introduction</ref> (esp. paras. 8–18), the essay now known as William
                    Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> initially appeared as
                    the anonymous letterpress to <title level="m">Select Views of Cumberland,
                        Westmoreland, and Lancashire</title>, a collection of forty-eight sketches
                    of Lake District landscapes by the Reverend Joseph Wilkinson. Marketed primarily
                    to affluent collectors, printed on high-end folio paper, and distributed by
                    leading art publisher Rudolph Ackermann, <title level="m">Select Views</title>
                    was, as Wordsworth remarked in 1820, “an expensive work, and necessarily of
                    limited circulation.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">From Wordsworth’s preface
                        to the “2nd edition” of the <title level="m">Guide</title>, which he
                        retitled <title level="a">Topographical Description of the Country of the
                            Lakes</title> and appended to his <title level="m">River Duddon</title>
                        collection of 1820 (p. 214).</note> Though the poet would repeatedly rework
                    his essay over the next quarter century, the 1810 text remained its heart. This
                    is readily seen in our <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/imported/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.paralleltext.pdf">parallel-text comparison</ref>, which tracks his extensive changes and
                    additions over the four subsequent editions of the <title level="m">Guide</title> published under his name between 1820 and 1835. </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">In accepting the <title level="m">Select Views</title> commission,
                    Wordsworth had two distinct assignments. The first, offering a general survey of

                    landmarks featured in Wilkinson’s sketches, proved considerably more vexing for

                    literature and the arts. You have cultivated a genuine taste for the sublime and
                    beautiful, and for the tranquil pleasures of rural retirement, amid the
                    turbulence of political life; which is apt in minds less happily disposed, to
                    abstract the attention from objects of more humble but more soothing and more

                    accuracy of the representations. You, dear Sir, have frequently approved and
                    encouraged the efforts of my pencil; and it was your suggestion, which excited

                    the scenery of Cumberland, Westmoreland and Lancashire. I was for many years a
                    resident in the most picturesque part of the North. Many of these views are
                    therefore endeared to me by numerous recollections of past times; but I trust
                    that the soft and the smiling, the wild and the rugged features with which they
                    are <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/0-4-Dedication%202.jpg">[Dedication p. 2]</ref> blended, will render them interesting to the
                    general beholder, who may not have seen the original landscapes; and in whom

               <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
               <p>At Lucerne in Switzerland there existed some years ago, and perhaps does still
                    exist, a model of a large portion of the Alpine country encompassing the lake of
                    the four Cantons. The spectator ascended a little platform and saw Mountains,
                    Lakes, Glaciers, Rivers, Woods, Waterfalls, and Vallies, with their Cottages and
                    every other object which they contained, lying at his feet; all things being
                    represented in their exact proportions and appropriate colours. It may be easily
                    conceived that this exhibition afforded an exquisite delight to the imagination,
                    which was tempted to wander from valley to valley, from mountain to mountain, at
                    will through the deepest recesses of the Alps. But it supplied also a more solid
                    and substantial pleasure; for the sublime and beautiful region, with all its
                    hidden treasures and their relations and bearings to each other, was thereby
                    comprehended and <emph>understood</emph> at once.</p>
               <p>Something of this kind (as far as can be performed by words, which must needs be
                    most inadequately) will be attempted in the following introductory pages, with
                    reference to the country which has furnished the subjects of the Drawings now
                    offered to the public, adding to a verbal representation of its permanent
                    features such appearances as are transitory from their dependence upon accidents
                    of season and weather. This, if tolerably executed, will in some instances
                    communicate to the traveller, who has already seen the objects, new information;
                    and will assist him to give to his recollections a more orderly arrangement than
                    his own opportunities of observing may have permitted him to do; while it will
                    be still more useful to the future traveller by directing his attention at once
                    to distinctions in things which, without such previous aid, a length of time
                    only could enable him to discover. And, as must be obvious, this general
                    introduction will combine with the Etchings certain notices of things which,
                    though they may not lie within the province of the pencil, cannot but tend to
                    render its productions more interesting; especially in a case like the present,
                    where a work wishes to recommend itself by a twofold claim, viz. by furnishing
                    pleasing Sketches, and at the same time accurate Portraits of those scenes from
                    which they are taken.</p>
               <p>To begin then with the main demarkation of the Country, I know not how I can give
                    the reader a more distinct image of this than by requesting him to place himself
                    in imagination upon some given point; let it be the top of either of the <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/2.jpg">[p. 2]</ref> mountains of Great Gavel or Scawfell; or rather let him
                    suppose his station to be a cloud hanging midway between the two mountains, at
                    not more than half a mile’s distance from the summit of each, and but a few
                    yards above their highest elevation, he will then see stretched at his feet a
                    number of Vallies, not fewer than nine, diverging from the point, on which he is
                    supposed to stand, like spokes from the nave of a wheel. First he will note,
                    lying to the south east, the Vale of Langdale which will conduct his eye to the
                    long Lake of Winandermere stretching, as appears, nearly to the sea, or rather
                    to the sands of the vast Bay of Morecamb, which here serves for the rim of this
                    imaginary wheel, trace it in a direction from the south east towards the south,
                    and he will next fix his eyes upon the Vale of Coniston running up likewise from
                    the sea, but not (as all the other vallies do) to the station which I have
                    considered as the nave of the wheel; and therefore it may not be inaptly
                    represented as a broken spoke sticking in the rim. Looking forth again, with an
                    inclination towards the west, immediately at our feet lies the Vale of Duddon,
                    in which is no Lake but a copious river winding among fields, rocks, and
                    mountains, and terminating its course in the Sands of Duddon. The fourth valley
                    which we shall next observe, viz. that of Eskdale, is of the same general
                    character as the last, yet beautifully discriminated from it by features which,
                    in the more minute details attached to the several parts of this work, will
                    hereafter be described. Next, almost due west, look down upon and into the deep
                    Valley of Wastdale with its little chapel and half a dozen neat scattered
                    dwellings, a plain of meadow and corn ground intersected with stone walls
                    apparently innumerable, like a large piece of lawless patch-work, or an array of
                    mathematical figures, such as in the ancient schools of geometry might have been
                    sportively and fantastically traced out upon sand. Beyond this little fertile
                    plain lies, within its bed of steep mountains, the long, narrow, stern, and
                    desolate Lake of Wastdale; and beyond this a dusky tract of level ground
                    conducts the eye to the Irish Sea. The several Vales of Ennerdale and
                    Buttermere, with their Lakes, next present themselves; and lastly the Vale of
                    Borrodale, of which that of Keswick is only a continuation, stretching due
                    north, brings us to a point nearly opposite to the Vale of Winandermere with
                    which we began. From this it will appear that the image of a wheel, which I have
                    made use of, and which is thus far exact, is not much more than half complete;
                    but the deficiency on the eastern side may be supplied by the vales of
                    Wytheburn, Ulswater, Hawswater, and the Vale of Grasmere and Rydale; none of
                    these however run up to the central point between Great Gavel and Scawfell. From
                    this, hitherto our central point, take a flight of not more than three or four
                    miles eastward to the ridge of Helvellyn and you will look down upon Wytheburn
                    and St. John’s Vale, which are a branch of the Vale of Keswick, upon Ulswater
                    stretching due east; and not far beyond to the south east, (though from this
                    point not visible) lie the Vale and <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/3.jpg">[p. 3]</ref> Lake of Hawswater; and lastly the winding Vale of Grasmere,
                    Rydale, and Ambleside, brings you back to Winandermere, thus completing, though
                    on the eastern side in an irregular manner, the representative figure of the
                    wheel.</p>
               <p>Such, concisely given, is the general topographical view of the country of the
                    Lakes in the North of England. But it must be observed that the visits of
                    travellers are for the most part confined to the Vales of Coniston, Winandermere
                    with the intermediate country between Ambleside and Keswick, the Vale of Keswick
                    itself, Buttermere, and Ulswater, which are the most easy of access, and indeed
                    from their several characters most likely to repay general curiosity; though
                    each of the other more retired vales, as will appear when we enter into detail
                    in the several numbers of this publication, has its own appropriate
                    beauties—all exquisite in their kind.</p>
               <p>This Introduction will be confined as much as possible to general remarks. And
                    first, returning to the illustrative figure which has been employed, it may be
                    observed that from the circumference to the centre, that is from the sea or
                    plain country, to the mountains of Great Gavel and Scawfell, there is in the
                    several ridges that enclose these vales, and divide them from each other, I mean
                    in the forms and surfaces, first of the swelling grounds, next of the hills and
                    rocks, and lastly of the mountains, an ascent by almost regular gradation from
                    elegance and richness to the highest point of grandeur. It follows therefore
                    from this, first, that these rocks, hills, and mountains, must present
                    themselves to the view in stages rising above each other, the mountains
                    clustering together towards the central point; and, next, that an observer
                    familiar with the several vales, must, from their various position in relation
                    to the sun, have had before his eyes every possible embellishment of beauty,
                    dignity, and splendour, which light and shadow can bestow upon objects so
                    diversified. For example, in the Vale of Winandermere, if the spectator looks
                    for gentle and lovely scenes, his eye is turned towards the south; if for the
                    grand, towards the north; in the Vale of Keswick, which (as hath been said) lies
                    almost due north of this, it is directly the reverse. Hence, when the sun is
                    setting in summer far to the north west, it is seen by the spectator from the
                    shores or breast of Winandermere resting among the summits of the loftiest
                    mountains, some of which will perhaps be half or wholly hidden by clouds, or by
                    the blaze of light which the orb diffuses around it; and the surface of the lake
                    will reflect before the eye correspondent colours through every variety of
                    beauty, and through all degrees of splendour. In the Vale of Keswick, at the
                    same period, the sun sets over the humbler regions of the landscape, and showers
                    down upon <emph>them</emph> the radiance which at once veils and glorifies,
                    sending forth, meanwhile, broad streams of rosy, crimson, purple, or golden,
                    light towards the grand mountains in the south and south east, which, thus
                    illuminated, with all their projections and cavities, and with an intermixture
                    of solemn shadows, are seen distinctly through <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/4_0.jpg">[p. 4]</ref> a cool and clear atmosphere. Of course there is as marked a
                    difference between the <emph>noontide</emph> appearance of these two opposite
                    vales. The bedimming haze that overspreads the south, and the clear atmosphere
                    and determined shadows of the clouds in the north, at the same time of the day,
                    are each seen, in these several vales, with a contrast as striking. The reader
                    perceiving in what degree the intermediate vales will partake of the same
                    variety.</p>
               <p>I do not indeed know any tract of country in which, within so narrow a compass,
                    may be found an equal variety in the influences of light and shadow upon the
                    grand or gentle features of landscape; and it is owing to the combined
                    circumstances to which I have directed the reader’s attention. From a point
                    between the mountains of Great Gavel and Scawfell, a shepherd would not require
                    more than an hour to descend into any one of eight of the principal vales by
                    which he would be surrounded; and all the others lie (with the exception of
                    Hawswater) but at a small distance. Yet, though thus clustered together, every
                    valley has its distinct and separate character; in some instances as if they had
                    been formed in studied contrast to each other, and in others with the united
                    pleasing differences and resemblances of a sisterly rivalship. This
                    concentration of interest gives to the country a decided superiority over the
                    most attractive districts of Scotland and Wales, especially for the pedestrian
                    traveller. In Scotland and Wales are found undoubtedly individual scenes which
                    in their several kinds cannot be surpassed. But in Scotland particularly what
                    desolate and unimpressive tracts of country almost perpetually intervene! so
                    that the traveller, when he reaches a spot deservedly of great celebrity, is
                    often at a loss to determine how much of his pleasure is owing to excellence
                    inherent in the landscape itself, and how much to an instantaneous recovery from
                    an oppression left upon his spirits by the barrenness and desolation through
                    which he has passed.</p>
               <p>For the <emph>forms</emph> of these mountains I refer to the Etchings to which
                    these pages are an Introduction, and from which it will appear that their
                    outlines are endlessly diversified, sweeping easily or boldly in simple majesty,
                    abrupt and precipitous, or soft and elegant. In magnitude and grandeur these
                    mountains are individually inferior to the most celebrated of those in some
                    other parts of this island; but in the combinations which they make, towering
                    above each other, or lifting themselves in ridges like the waves of a tumultuous
                    sea, and in the beauty and variety of their surfaces and their colours, they are
                    surpassed by none.</p>
               <p>The general <emph>surface</emph> of the mountains is turf made rich and green by
                    the moisture of the climate. Sometimes the turf, as in the neighbourhood of
                    Newlands, in particular, is little broken, the whole covering being soft and
                    downy pasturage. In other places rocks predominate; the soil is laid bare by
                    torrents and burstings of water from the sides of the mountains in heavy rains;
                    and occasionally their perpendicular sides are seamed by ravines formed also by
                    rains and torrents, <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/5.jpg">[p. 5]</ref> which, meeting in angular points, entrench and scar over the
                    surface with numerous figures like the letters W and Y.</p>
               <p>The Mountains are composed of the stone by mineralogists termed schist, which, as
                    you approach the plain country, gives way to lime-stone; but, schist being the
                    substance of the mountains, the predominant <emph>colour</emph> of
                        their <emph>rocky</emph> parts is bluish or of hoary grey—the general
                    tint of the lichens with which the bare stone is encrusted. With this blue and
                    grey colour is frequently intermixed a red tinge proceeding from the iron with
                    which the stone is interveined and the soil in many places impregnated. The iron
                    is the principle of decomposition in these rocks; and hence, when they become
                    pulverized, the elementary particles crumbling down overspread in many places
                    the steep and almost precipitous sides of the mountains with an intermixture of
                    colours like the compound hues of a dove’s neck. When, in the heat of advancing
                    summer, the freshness of the green tint of the herbage has somewhat faded, it is
                    again revived by the appearance of the fern profusely spread every where; and
                    upon this plant more than upon any thing else do the changes, which the seasons
                    make in the colouring of the mountains depend. By the first week in October, the
                    rich green which was preserved through the whole summer by the herbage and by
                    this plant, has usually passed away; its brilliant and various colours of light
                    yellow, orange, and brown, are then in harmony with the autumnal woods; bright
                    yellow or lemon colour, at the base of the mountains, melting gradually through
                    orange to a dark russet brown towards the summits, where the plant being more
                    exposed to the weather, is in a more advanced state of decay. Neither heath nor
                    furze are <emph>generally</emph> found upon the sides of these mountains, though
                    in some places they are richly adorned by them. We may add, that the mountains
                    are of height sufficient to have the surface towards the summits softened by
                    distance, and to imbibe the finest aerial hues. In common also with other
                    mountains, their apparent forms and colours are perpetually changed by the
                    clouds and vapours which float round them; the effect indeed of mist and haze,
                    in a country of this character, is like that of magic; I have seen six or seven
                    ridges rising above each other, all created in a moment by the vapours upon the
                    side of a mountain, which, in its ordinary appearance, shewed not a projecting
                    point to furnish even a hint for such an operation.</p>
               <p>I will take this opportunity of observing that they, who have studied the
                    appearances of nature, feel that the superiority, in point of visual interest,
                    of mountainous over other countries—is more strikingly displayed in winter
                    than in summer. This, as must be obvious is partly owing to
                        the <emph>forms</emph>  of the mountains, which of course are not affected
                    by the seasons; but also, in no small degree, to the greater variety which
                    exists in their winter than their summer <emph>colouring</emph>. This variety is
                    such and so harmoniously preserved, that it leaves little cause of <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/6_0.jpg">[p. 6]</ref> regret when the splendour of autumn is passed away. The
                    coppice woods, upon the sides of the mountains, retain russet leaves; the birch
                    stands conspicuous with its silver stem and puce-coloured twigs; the hollies
                    have come forth to view, with green leaves and scarlet berries, from among the
                    deciduous trees whose summer foliage had concealed them; the ivy is now apparent
                    upon the stems and boughs of the trees, and among the woody rocks. In place of
                    the uniform summer green of the herbage and fern, many rich colours play into
                    each other over the surface of the mountains; turf (whose tints are
                    interchangeably tawny–green, olive, and brown), beds of withered fern, and grey
                    rocks, being harmoniously blended together. The mosses and lichens are never so
                    fresh and flourishing as in winter, if it be not a season of frost; and their
                    minute beauties prodigally adorn the fore-ground. Wherever we turn, we find
                    these productions of nature, to which winter is rather favourable than unkindly,
                    scattered over the walls, banks of earth, rocks, and stones, and upon the trunks
                    of trees, with the intermixture of several species of small fern, now green and
                    fresh; and to the observing passenger their forms and colours are a source of
                    inexhaustible admiration. Add to this the hoar frost and snow with all the
                    varieties which they create, and which volumes would not be sufficient to
                    describe. I will content myself with one instance of the colouring produced by
                    snow, which may not be uninteresting to Painters. It is extracted from the
                    memorandum book of a friend, and for its accuracy I can speak, as I myself was
                    an eye-witness of the appearance. “I observed, says he, “the beautiful effect of
                    the drifted snow upon the mountains, and the perfect <emph>tone</emph> of
                    colour. From the top of the mountains downward a rich olive was produced by the
                    powdery snow and the grass, which olive was warmed with a little brown, and in
                    this way harmoniously combined, by insensible gradations, with the white. The
                    drifting took away all the monotony of snow; and the whole vale of Grasmere,
                    seen from the terrace walk in Easedale, was as varied, perhaps more so, than
                    even in the pomp of autumn. In the distance was Loughrigg Fell, the basin wall
                    of the lake; this, from the summit downward, was a rich orange-olive; then the
                    lake a bright olive-green, nearly the same tint as the snow-powdered mountain
                    tops and high slopes in Easedale; and lastly the church with its firs, forming
                    the centre of the view. The firs looked magnificent, and carried the eye back to
                    some firs in Brother’s Wood on the left side of the lake (we looking towards
                    Loughrigg). Next to the church with its firs came nine distinguishable hills,
                    six of them with woody sides turned towards us, all of them oak-copses with
                    their bright red leaves and snow-powdered twigs; these hills all distinguishable
                    indeed from the summit downward, but none seen all the way down, so as to give
                    the strongest sense of number with unity; and these hills so variously situated
                    to each other and to the view in general, so variously powdered, some only
                    enough to give the herbage a rich brown tint, one intensely white and <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/7_0.jpg">[p. 7]</ref> lighting up all the others, and yet so placed as in the most
                    inobtrusive manner to harmonize by contrast with a perfect naked, snowless bleak
                    summit in the far distance in the left—the variety of site, of colour, of
                    woodiness, of the situation of the woods, &amp;c. &amp;c. made it not merely
                    number with unity, but intricacy combined that activity of feeling, which
                    intricacy awakens, with the complacency and repose of perfect unity.”</p>
               <p>Having spoken of the forms, surface, and colour of the mountains, let us descend
                    into the <hi rendition="#smallcaps">Vallies</hi>. Though these have been
                    represented under the general image of the spokes of a wheel, they are for the
                    most part winding; the windings of many being abrupt and intricate. And it may
                    be observed that in one circumstance, the general shape of them all has been
                    determined by that primitive conformation through which so many became
                    receptacles of lakes. For they are not formed, as are most of the celebrated
                    Welch Vallies, by an approximation of the sloping bases of the opposite
                    mountains towards each other, leaving little more between than a channel for the
                    passage of a hasty river; but the bottom of these vallies is, for the most part,
                    a spacious and gently declining area apparently level as the floor of a temple,
                    or the surface of a lake, and beautifully broken in many cases by rocks and
                    hills which rise up like islands from the plain. As the vallies make many
                    windings, these level areas open upon the traveller in succession, divided from
                    each other sometimes by a mutual approximation of the hills leaving only a
                    passage for a river; sometimes by correspondent windings without such
                    approximation; and sometimes by a bold advance of one mountain towards that
                    which is opposite to it. It may here be observed, with propriety, that the
                    several rocks and hills, which I have described as rising up like islands from
                    the level area of the vale, have regulated the choice of the inhabitants in the
                    situation of their dwellings. Where none of these are found and the inclination
                    of the ground is not sufficiently rapid easily to carry off the waters (as in
                    the higher part of Langdale for instance), the houses are not sprinkled over the
                    middle part of the vales but confined to their sides, being placed merely so far
                    up the mountain as to protect them from the floods. But, where these rocks and
                    hills have been scattered over the plain of the vale (as in Grasmere,
                    Seathwaite, Eskdale, &amp;c.) the beauty which they give to the scene is much
                    heightened by a single cottage or clustre of cottages which will be almost
                    always found under them or upon their sides; dryness and shelter having tempted
                    the Dalesmen to fix their habitations there.</p>
               <p>I shall now say a few words concerning the <hi rendition="#smallcaps">Lakes</hi>
                    of this country. The form of the lake is most perfect when, like Derwent-water
                    and some of the smaller lakes, it least resembles that of a river. I mean, when
                    being looked at from any given point where the whole may be seen at once, the
                    width of it bears such proportion to the length that, however the outline may be
                    diversified by far-shooting bays, it never assumes the shape of a river, and is
                    contemplated with that placid and quiet feel- <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/8_0.jpg">[p. 8]</ref> ing which belongs peculiarly to the lake as a body of still
                    water under the influence of no current, reflecting therefore the clouds, the
                    light, and all the imagery of the sky and surrounding hills, expressing and
                    making visible the changes of the atmosphere, and motion of the lightest breeze,
                    and subject to agitation only from the winds— <quote>

               </p>
               <p>It must be noticed as a favourable characteristic of the lakes of this country
                    that though several of the largest, such as Winandermere, Ulswater, Hawswater,
                    &amp;c. do, when the whole length of them is commanded from an elevated point,
                    lose somewhat of the peculiar form of the lake and assume the resemblance of a
                    magnificent river; yet, as their shape is winding (particularly that of Ulswater
                    and Hawswater), when the view of the whole is obstructed by those barriers which
                    determine the windings, and the spectator is confined to one reach, the
                    appropriate feeling is revived; and one lake may thus in succession present the
                    essential characteristic of many. Hence I am led to remark that, while the forms
                    of the large lakes have this advantage, it is a circumstance still more
                    favourable to the beauty of the country that the largest of them are small; and
                    that the same valley generally furnishes a succession of lakes, instead of being
                    filled by one. The vallies in North Wales, as hath been observed, are not formed
                    for the reception of lakes; those of Switzerland, Scotland, and this part of the
                    North England, are so formed; but in Switzerland and Scotland the proportion of
                    diffused water is often too great, as at the lake of Geneva for instance, and
                    most of the Scotch lakes. No doubt it sounds magnificent and flatters the
                    imagination to hear at a distance of such expanses of water so many leagues in
                    length and miles in width; and such ample room may be delightful to the fresh
                    water sailor scudding with a lively breeze amid the rapidly shifting scenery.
                    But who ever travelled along the banks of Loch Lomond variegated as the lower
                    part is with islands, without wishing for a speedier termination of the long
                    vista of blank water, for an interposition of green meadows, trees, and
                    cottages, and a sparkling stream to run by his side? in fact, a notion of
                    grandeur, as connected with magnitude, has seduced persons of taste into a
                    general mistake upon this subject. It is much more desirable for the purposes of
                    pleasure that lakes should be numerous, and small or middle sized than large,
                    not only for communication by walks and rides, but for variety and recurrence of
                    similar appearances. To illustrate this only by one instance:—how pleasing
                    is it to have a ready and frequent opportunity of watching at the outlet of a
                    lake, the stream pushing its way among the rocks in lively contrast with the
                    stillness from which it has escaped; and how amusing to compare its noisy and
                    turbulent motions with the <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/9_0.jpg">[p. 9]</ref> gentle playfulness of the breezes, which may be starting up or
                    wandering here and there over the faintly rippled surface of the broad water. I
                    may add, as a general remark upon this subject, that in lakes of great width,
                    the shores cannot be distinctly seen at the same time, and therefore contribute
                    little to mutual illustration and ornament; and if, like the American and
                    Asiatic lakes, the opposite shores are out of sight of each other, then
                    unfortunately the traveller is reminded of a nobler object; he has the blankness
                    of a sea prospect without the same grandeur and accompanying sense of power.</p>
               <p>So much for the form and size of lakes in general as illustrative of these in
                    particular.—Their size and forms being thus in general terms described, I
                    may add that, from the multitude of brooks and torrents which fall into them,
                    and of internal springs by which they are fed, and which circulate through them
                    like veins, they are truly living lakes, “<emph>vivi lacus,</emph>” and are thus
                    discriminated from the stagnant and sullen pools frequent among mountains that
                    have been formed by volcanos, and from the shallow meres which are found in flat
                    and fenny countries. The water is also pure and chrystalline; so that, if it
                    were not for the reflections of the incumbent mountains by which it is darkened,
                    a delusion might be felt by a person resting quietly in a boat on the bosom of
                    Winandermere or Derwent-water similar to that which Carver so beautifully
                    describes when he was floating alone in the middle of the lake Erie or Ontario,
                    and could almost have imagined that his boat was suspended in an element as pure
                    as air, or rather that the air and water were one.</p>
               <p>As to the shores, it will be understood that those of the lakes in this country
                    are endlessly diversified; in some places mountains, that admit of no
                    cultivation, descend abruptly into the water; in others the shore is formed by
                    gently sloping lawns and rich woods, with the interposition of flat and fertile
                    meadows between the margin of the lake and the mountains; in many places they
                    are beautifully edged with a rim of blue gravel; here and there are found,
                    bordering the lake, groves (if I may so call them) of reeds and bulrushes, or
                    water-lilies lifting up the orb of their large leaves to the breeze, if it be
                    stirring, while the white flower is heaving upon the wave.</p>
               <p>The <hi rendition="#smallcaps">Islands</hi> are neither so numerous, nor so
                    beautiful, as might be expected from the account which I have given of the
                    manner in which the level areas of the vales are so frequently diversified by
                    rocks, hills, and hillocks, scattered over them; nor are they ornamented, as are
                    sometimes the islands of the lakes in Scotland, by the remains of castles or
                    other places of defence, or of monastic edifices. There is however a beautiful
                    cluster of islands at Winandermere; a pair of pleasingly contrasted at Rydale;
                    nor must the solitary green Island of Grasmere be forgotten. In the bosom of
                    each of the lakes of Ennerdale and Devock-water is a single rock which owing to
                    its neighbourhood to the sea, is <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/10_0.jpg">[p. 10]</ref>

                    several scenes. </p>
               <p>Having spoken of lakes I must not omit to mention, as a kindred feature of this
                    country, those bodies of still water which are called TARNS. These are found in
                    some of the vallies, and are very numerous upon the mountains. A Tarn <emph>in a
                        vale</emph> implies, for the most part, that the bed of the vale is not
                    happily formed; that the water of the brooks can neither wholly escape, nor
                    diffuse itself over a large area. Accordingly, in such situations, tarns are
                    often surrounded by a tract of boggy ground which has an unsightly appearance;
                    but this is not always the case, and in the cultivated parts of the country,
                    when the shores of the tarn are determined, it differs only from the lake in
                    being smaller and in belonging mostly to a smaller valley or circular recess. Of
                    this miniature class of lakes Loughrigg Tarn near Grasmere is the most beautiful
                    example. It has its margin of green firm meadows, of rocks and rocky woods, a
                    few reeds here, a little company of water lilies there, with beds of gravel or
                    stone beyond; a tiny stream issuing neither briskly nor sluggishly out of it;
                    but its feeding rills, from the shortness of their course, so small as to be
                    scarcely visible. Five or six cottages are reflected in its peaceful bosom;
                    rocky and barren steeps rise up above the hanging enclosures; and the solemn
                    pikes of Langdale overlook, from a distance, the low cultivated ridge of land
                    that forms the northern boundary of this small, quiet, and fertile domain.
                        The <emph>mountain</emph> tarns can only be recommended to the notice of the
                    inquisitive traveller who has time to spare. They are difficult of access and
                    naked; yet some of them are, in their permanent forms, very grand; and there are
                    accidents of things which would make the meanest of them interesting. In the
                    first place one of these pools is an acceptable sight to the mountain wanderer,
                    not merely as an incident that diversifies the prospect, but as forming in his
                    mind a spot or conspicuous point to which objects, otherwise disconnected or
                    unsubordinated, may be referred. Some few have a varied outline, with bold
                    heath-clad promontories; and, as they mostly lie at the foot of a steep
                    precipice, the water appears black and sullen; and round the margin, masses of
                    rock are scattered. The feeling of solitude is seldom more strongly and more
                    solemnly impressed than by the side of one of these mountain pools; though
                    desolate and forbidding, it seems a distinct place to repair to, yet where the
                    visitants must be rare, and there can be no disturbance—Water fowl flock
                    hither; and the lonely angler may oftentimes here be seen; but the imagination,
                    not content with this, is tempted to attribute a voluntary power to every change
                    which takes place in such a spot, whether it be the breeze that wanders over the
                    surface of the water, or the splendid lights of evening that rest upon it in the
                    midst of the awful precipices. <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/11_0.jpg">[p. 11]</ref>

               <p>Though this country is, on one side, bounded by the sea which combines
                    beautifully, from some elevated points of view, with the inland scenery; yet no
                    where are found the grand estuaries which are common in Scotland and Wales: the
                    lakes are such in the strict and usual sense of the word, being all of fresh
                    water; nor have the rivers themselves, from the shortness of their course, time
                    to acquire that body of water necessary to confer upon them much majesty. In
                    fact, while they continue in the mountain and lake country, they are rather
                    large brooks than rivers. The water is perfectly pellucid, through which in many
                    places are seen to a great depth their beds of rock or of blue gravel, which
                    give to the water itself and exquisitely cerulean colour: this is particularly
                    striking in the rivers of Derwent and Duddon which may confidently be compared,
                    such and so various are their beauties, to any two rivers of equal length of
                    course in any country. The number of the torrents and smaller brooks is
                    infinite, with their water-falls and water-breaks; and they need not here be
                    described. I will only observe that, as many, even of the smallest of these
                    rills, have either found or made for themselves recesses in the sides of the
                    mountains or in the vales, they have tempted the primitive inhabitants to settle
                    near them for household accommodation and for shelter; and hence the retirement
                    and seclusion by which these cottages are endeared to the eye of the man of
                    sensibility.</p>
               <p>The woods consist chiefly of oak, ash, and birch, and here and there (though very
                    rarely) a species of elm, with underwood of hazel, the white and black thorn and
                    hollies; in the moist places alders and willows abound; and yews among the
                    rocks. Formerly the whole country must have been covered with wood to a great
                    height up the mountains; and native Scotch firs (as in the northern parts of
                    Scotland to this day) must have grown in great profusion. But no one of these
                    old inhabitants of the country remains, or perhaps has done for some hundreds of
                    years; beautiful traces, however, of the universal sylvan appearance, which the
                    country formerly had, are yet seen both in the native coppice woods which
                    remain, and which have been protected by enclosures, and also in the forest
                    trees and hollies which, though disappearing fast, are yet scattered over both
                    the enclosed and uninclosed parts of the mountains. The same is expressed by the
                    beauty and intricacy with which the fields and coppice-woods are often
                    intermingled: the plough of the first settlers having followed naturally the
                    veins of richer, dryer, or less stony soil; and thus it has shaped out an
                    intermixture of wood and lawn the grace <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/12_0.jpg">[p. 12]</ref> and wildness of which it would have been impossible for the
                    hand of studied art to produce. Other trees have been introduced within these
                    last fifty years, such as beeches, larches, elms, limes, &amp;c. and plantations
                    of Scotch firs, seldom with advantage, and often with great injury to the
                    appearance of the country: but the sycamore (which I believe was brought into
                    this island from Germany not more than two hundred years ago) has long been the
                    favourite of the cottagers; and, with the Scotch fir, has been chosen to screen
                    their dwellings; and is sometimes found in the fields whither the winds or
                    waters may have carried its seeds.</p>
               <p>The want which is most felt, however, is that of timber trees. There are few
                    magnificent ones to be found near any of the lakes; and indeed, unless greater
                    care be taken, there will in a short time scarcely be left an oak that would
                    repay the cost of felling. The neighbourhood of Rydale, notwithstanding the
                    havoc which has been made, is yet nobly distinguished; and we have reason to
                    hope, will long continue so. In the woods of Lowther also are found store of the
                    grandest trees, and all the majesty and wildness of the native forest.</p>
               <p>Among the smaller vegetable ornaments which nature has here provided, must be
                    reckoned the juniper, bilberry, and the broom plant, with which the hills and
                    woods abound, the Dutch myrtle in moist places, and the endless variety of
                    brilliant flowers in the fields and meadows; which, if the agriculture of the
                    country were more carefully attended to, would disappear. Nor can I omit again
                    to notice the lichens and mosses, which, in profusion, beauty, and variety,
                    exceed those of any other country I have seen.</p>
               <p>Thus far I have chiefly spoken of the features by which Nature has discriminated
                    this country from others. I will now describe in general terms, in what manner
                    it is indebted to the hand of man. What I have to notice on this subject will
                    emanate most easily and perspicuously from a description of the ancient and
                    present inhabitants, their occupations, their condition of life, the
                    distribution of landed property among them, and the tenure by which it is
                    holden.</p>
               <p>The reader will here suffer me to recall to his mind the description which I have
                    given of the substance and form of these mountains, the shape of the vallies and
                    their position with respect to each other. He will people the vallies with lakes
                    and rivers, the sides and coves of the mountains with pools and torrents; and
                    will bound half of the circle which we have contemplated by the sands of the
                    sea, or by the sea itself. He will conceive that, from the point upon which he
                    before stood he looks down upon this scene before the country had been
                    penetrated by any inhabitants; to vary his sensations and to break in upon their
                    stillness, he will form to himself an image of the tides visiting and revisiting
                    the Friths, the main sea dashing against the bolder shore, the rivers pursuing
                    their course to be lost in the mighty mass of waters. He may see or hear in
                    fancy the winds sweeping over the lakes, <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/13_0.jpg">[p. 13]</ref> or piping with a loud noise among the mountain peaks; and
                    lastly may think of the primœval woods shedding and renewing their leaves with
                    no human eye to notice, or human heart to regret or welcome the change. “When
                    the first settlers entered this region, (says an animated writer) they found it
                    overspread with wood; forest trees, the fir, the oak, the ash, and the birch,
                    had skirted the fells, tufted the hills, and shaded the vallies through
                    centuries of silent solitude; the birds and beasts of prey reigned over the
                    meeker species; and the bellum inter omnia maintained the balance of nature in
                    the empire of beasts.”</p>
               <p>Such was the state and appearance of this region when the aboriginal colonists of
                    the Celtic tribes were first driven or drawn towards it, and became joint
                    tenants with the wolf, the boar, the wild bull, the red deer and the leigh, a
                    gigantic species of deer which has been long extinct; while the inaccessible
                    crags were occupied by the falcon, the raven, and the eagle. The inner parts
                    were too secluded and of too little value to participate much of the benefit of
                    Roman manners; and though these conquerors encouraged the Britons to the
                    improvement of their lands in the plain country of Furness and Cumberland, they
                    seem to have had little connection with the mountains which were not subservient
                    to the profit they drew from the mines.</p>
               <p>When the Romans retired from Great Britain, it is well known that these mountain
                    fastnesses furnished a protection to some unsubdued Britons, long after the more
                    accessible and more fertile districts had been seized by the Saxon or Danish
                    invader. A few traces of Roman forts or camps, as at Ambleside and upon
                    Dunmallet, (erected probably to secure a quiet transfer of the ore from the
                    mines) and two or three circles of rude stones attributed to the Druids, are the
                    only visible vestiges, that remain upon the surface of the country, of these
                    ancient occupants; and as the Saxons and Danes, who succeeded to the possession
                    of the villages and hamlets which had been established by the Britons, seem to
                    have confined themselves to the open country,—we may descend at once to
                    times long posterior to the conquest by the Normans when their feudal policy was
                    regularly established. We may easily conceive that these narrow dales and
                    mountain sides, choaked up as they would be with wood, lying out of the way of
                    communication with other parts of the Island, and upon the edge of a hostile
                    kingdom, would have little attraction for the high-born and powerful; especially
                    as the more open parts of the country furnished positions for castles and houses
                    of defence sufficient to repel any of those sudden attacks, which in the then
                    rude state of military knowledge, could be made upon them. Accordingly the more
                    retired regions (and observe it is to these I am now confining myself) must have
                    been neglected or shunned even by the persons whose baronial or seignioral
                    rights extended over them, and left doubtless partly as a place of refuge for
                    outlaws and robbers, and partly granted out for the more settled habi- <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/14_0.jpg">[p. 14]</ref> tation of a few vassals following the employment of shepherds
                    or woodlanders. Hence these lakes and inner vallies are unadorned by any of the
                    remains of ancient grandeur, castles or monastic edifices, which are only found
                    upon the skirts of this country, as Furness Abbey, Calder Abbey, the Priory of
                    Lanercost, Gleaston Castle, the original residence of the Flemings, and the
                    numerous ancient Castles of the Cliffords and the Dacres. On the southern side
                    of these mountains, (especially in that part known by the name of Furness Fells,
                    which is more remote from the borders) the state of society would necessarily be
                    more settled; though it was fashioned not a little, with the rest of this
                    country, by its neighbourhood to a hostile kingdom. We will therefore give a
                    sketch of the œconomy of the Abbots in the distribution of lands among their
                    tenants, as similar plans were doubtless adopted by other Lords, and as the
                    consequences have affected the face of the country materially to the present
                    day, being in fact one of the principal causes which give it such a striking
                    superiority, in beauty and interest over all other parts of the Island.</p>
               <p>“When the Abbots of Furness,” says an author before cited, “enfranchised their
                    villains, and raised them to the dignity of customary tenants, the lands, which
                    they had cultivated for their lord were divided into whole tenements; each of
                    which, besides the customary annual rent, was charged with the obligation of
                    having in readiness a man completely armed for the king’s service on the borders
                    or elsewhere; each of these whole tenements was again subdivided into four equal
                    parts; each villain had one; and the party tenant contributed his share to the
                    support of the man at arms, and of other burthens. These divisions were not
                    properly distinguished; the land remained mixed; each tenant had a share through
                    all the arable and meadow land, and common of pasture over all the wastes. These
                    sub-tenements were judged sufficient for the support of so many families; and no
                    further division was permitted. These divisions and sub-divisions were
                    convenient at the time for which they were calculated; the land, so parcelled
                    out, was of necessity more attended to; and the industry greater, when more
                    persons were to be supported by the produce of it. The frontier of the kingdom,
                    within which Furness was considered, was in a constant state of attack and
                    defence; more hands therefore were necessary to guard the coast, to repel an
                    invasion from Scotland, or make reprisals on the hostile neighbour. The dividing
                    the lands in such manner as has been shewn, increased the number of inhabitants,
                    and kept them at home till called for; and, the land being mixed, and the
                    several tenants united in equipping the plough, the absence of the fourth man
                    was no prejudice to the cultivation of his land, which was committed to the care
                    of three.</p>
               <p>While the villains of Low Furness were thus distributed over the land, and
                    employed in agriculture; those of High Furness were charged with the care of
                    flocks and herds, to protect them from the wolves which lurked in the
                        thickets, <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/15_0.jpg">[p. 15]</ref> and in winter to brouze them with the tender sprouts of
                    hollies and ash. This custom was not till lately discontinued in High Furness;
                    and holly trees were carefully preserved for that purpose, when all other wood
                    was cleared off; large tracts of common being so covered with these trees as to
                    have the appearance of a forest of hollies. At the Shepherd’s call the flocks
                    surrounded the holly bush, and received the croppings at his hand which they
                    greedily nibbled up, bleating for more. The Abbots of Furness enfranchised these
                    pastoral vassals, and permitted them to enclose <hi rend="italic">quillets </hi>to their houses for which they paid encroachment rent.”—<hi rendition="#smallcaps">West’s</hi> <title level="m">Antiquities of
                        Furness</title>.</p>
               <p>However desirable for the purposes of defence a numerous population might be, it
                    was not possible to make at once the same numerous allotments among the untilled
                    vallies and upon the sides of the mountains as had been made in the cultivated
                    plains. The enfranchised shepherd or woodlander, having chosen there his place
                    of residence, builds it of sods or of the mountain stone, and with the
                    permission of his lord, encloses, like Robinson Crusoe, a small croft or two
                    immediately at his door for such animals chiefly as he wishes to protect. Others
                    are happy to imitate his example, and avail themselves of the same privileges;
                    and thus population creeps on towards the more secluded parts of the vallies.
                    Chapels, daughters of some distant mother church, are first erected in the more
                    open and fertile vales, as those of Bowness and Grasmere, offsets of Kendal;
                    which again after a period, as the settled population increases, become mother
                    churches to smaller edifices scattered at length almost in every dale throughout
                    the country. The enclosures, formed by the tenantry, are for a long time
                    confined to the home-steads; and the arable and meadow land of the vales is
                    possessed in common field; the several portions being marked out by stones,
                    bushes, or trees; which portions, where the custom has survived, to this day are
                        called <emph>Dales</emph>, probably from the Belgic
                    word <emph>deylen</emph>, (to distribute) but while the vale was thus lying
                    open, enclosures seem to have taken place, upon the sides of the mountains;
                    because the land there was not intermixed, and was of little comparative value;
                    and therefore small opposition would be made to its being appropriated by those
                    to whose habitations it was contiguous. Hence the singular appearance which the
                    sides of many of these mountains exhibit, intersected as they are almost to
                    their summit, with stone walls, of which the fences are always formed. When
                    first erected, they must have little disfigured the face of the country; as part
                    of the lines would every where be hidden by the quantity of native wood then
                    remaining; and the lines would also be broken (as they still are) by the rocks
                    which interrupt and vary their course. In the meadows, and in those parts of the
                    lower grounds where the soil has not been sufficiently drained and could not
                    afford a stable foundation, there, when the encreasing value of land and the
                    inconvenience suffered from intermixed plots of ground in common field had
                    induced each in- <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/16_0.jpg">[p. 16]</ref> habitant to enclose his own, they were compelled to make the
                    fences of alders, willows, and other trees. These where the native wood had
                    disappeared, have frequently enriched the vallies with a sylvan appearance;
                    while the intricate intermixture of property has given to the fences a graceful
                    irregularity, which, where large properties are prevalent and large capitals
                    employed in agriculture, is unknown. This sylvan appearance is still further
                    heightened by the number of ash trees which have been planted in rows along the
                    quick fences, and along the walls, for the purpose of brouzing cattle at the
                    approach of winter. The branches are lopped off and strewed upon the pastures;
                    and, when the cattle have stripped them of the leaves, they are used for
                    repairing hedges or for fuel.</p>
               <p>We have thus seen a numerous body of dalesmen creeping into possession of their
                    home-steads, their little crofts, their mountain enclosures; and finally, the
                    whole vale is visibly divided; except perhaps here and there some marshy ground,
                    which till fully drained, would not repay the trouble of enclosing. But these
                    last partitions do not seem to have been general till long after the
                    pacification of the Borders, by the union of the two crowns; when the cause,
                    which had first determined the distribution of land into such small parcels, had
                    not only ceased,—but likewise a general improvement had taken place in the
                    country, with a correspondent rise in the value of its produce. From the time of
                    the union of the two kingdoms, it is certain that this species of feudal
                    population would rapidly diminish. That it was formerly much more numerous than
                    it is at present, is evident from the multitude of tenements (I do not mean
                    houses, but small divisions of land) which belonged formerly each to its several
                    proprietor, and for which separate fines are paid to the manorial lord at this
                    day. These are often in the proportion of four to one, of the present occupants.
                    “Sir Launcelot Threlkeld who lived in the reign of Henry VII, was wont to say,
                    he had three noble houses, one for pleasure, Crosby in Westmoreland, where he
                    had a park full of deer; one for profit and warmth, wherein to reside in winter,
                    namely, Yanwith nigh Penrith; and the third, Threlkeld (on the edge of the vale
                    of Keswick) well stocked with tenants to go with him to the wars.” But, as I
                    have said, from the union of the two kingdoms this numerous vassalage (their
                    services not being wanted) would rapidly diminish; various tenements would be
                    united in one possessor; and the aboriginal houses, probably little better than
                    hovels, like the kraels of savages or the huts of the Highlanders of Scotland,
                    would many of them fall into decay and wholly disappear, while the place of
                    others was supplied by substantial and comfortable buildings, a majority of
                    which remain to this day scattered over the vallies, and are in many the only
                    dwellings found in them.</p>
               <p>From the time of the erection of these houses, till within the last forty years,
                    the state of society, though no doubt slowly and gradually improving,
                        underwent <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/17_0.jpg">[p. 17]</ref> no material change. Corn was grown in these vales (through
                    which no carriage road had been made) sufficient upon each estate to furnish
                    bread for each family, and no more: notwithstanding the union of several
                    tenements, the possessions of each inhabitant still being small, in the same
                    field was seen an intermixture of different crops; and the plough was
                    interrupted by little rocks, mostly overgrown with wood, or by spungy places
                    which the Tillers of the soil had neither leisure nor capital to convert into
                    firm land. The storms and moisture of the climate induced them to sprinkle their
                    upland property with outhouses of native stone as places of shelter for their
                    sheep, where in tempestuous weather food was distributed to them. Every family
                    spun from its own flock the wool with which it was clothed; a weaver was here
                    and there found among them; and the rest of their wants were supplied by the
                    produce of the yarn, which they carded and spun in their own houses upon the
                    large wheel, and carried it to market either under their arms, or more
                    frequently on pack-horses, a small train taking their way weekly down the valley
                    or over the mountains to the most commodious town. They had, as I have said,
                    their rural chapel, and of course their Minister, in cloathing or in manner of
                    life in no respect differing from themselves, except on the Sabbath-day; this
                    was the sole distinguished individual among them; every thing else, person and
                    possession, exhibited a perfect equality, a community of Shepherds, and
                    Agriculturalists, proprietors for the most part of the lands which they occupied
                    and cultivated.</p>
               <p>While the process above detailed was going on, the native Forests must have been
                    every where receding: but trees were planted for the sustenance of the flocks in
                    winter, such was the then rude state of agriculture; and, for the same cause, it
                    was necessary that care should be taken of some part of the growth of the native
                    forest. Accordingly in Queen Elizabeth’s time this was so strongly felt, that a
                    petition was made to the Crown praying “that the Blomaries in high Furness might
                    be abolished on account of the quantity of wood which was consumed in them for
                    the use of the Mines, to the great detriment of the cattle.” But this same
                    cause, about a hundred years after, produced effects directly contrary to those
                    which had been deprecated. The re-establishment, at that period, of furnaces
                    upon a large scale made it the interest of the people to convert the steepest
                    and more stony of the enclosures, sprinkled over with the remains of the native
                    forest, into close woods, which, when cattle and sheep were excluded, rapidly
                    sowed and thickened themselves. I have already directed the Readers attention to
                    the cause by which tufts of wood, pasturage, meadow and arable land with its
                    various produce are intricately intermingled in the same field; and he will now
                    see in like manner how enclosures entirely of wood, and those of cultivated
                    ground, are blended all over the country under a law of similar wildness. <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/18_0.jpg">[p. 18]</ref>
               </p>
               <p>An historic detail has thus been given of the manner in which the hand of man has
                    acted upon the surface of the inner regions of the mountainous country, as
                    incorporated with and subservient to the powers and processes of nature. We will
                    now take a view of the same agency acting within narrower bounds for the
                    production of the few works of art and accommodations of life which in so simple
                    a state of society, could be necessary. These are merely habitations of man and
                    coverts for beasts, roads and bridges, and places of worship.</p>
               <p>And to begin with the <hi rendition="#smallcaps">Cottages</hi>. They are
                    scattered over the vallies, and under the hill sides, and on the rocks; and to
                    this day in the more retired dales, without any intrusion of more assuming
                    buildings, <quote>

                     </lg>
                  </quote> The dwelling houses, and contiguous out-houses are in many
                    instances of the colour of the native rock out of which they have been built;
                    but frequently the dwelling house has been distinguished from the barn and byre
                    by rough-cast, and white wash, which, as the inhabitants are not hasty in
                    renewing it, in a few years acquires, by the influence of the weather, a tint at
                    once sober and variegated. As these houses have been from father to son
                    inhabited by persons engaged in the same occupations, yet necessarily with
                    changes in their circumstances, they have received additions and accommodations
                    adapted to the needs of each successive occupant, who, being for the most part
                    proprietor, was at liberty to follow his own fancy; so that these humble
                    dwellings remind the contemplative spectator of a production of nature, and may
                    (using a strong expression) rather be said to have grown than to have been
                    erected;—to have risen by an instinct of their own out of the native rock;
                    so little is there in them of formality; such is their wildness and beauty.
                    Among the numerous recesses and projections in the walls and in the different
                    stages of their roofs are seen the boldest and most harmonious effects of
                    contrasted sunshine and shadow. It is a favourable circumstance that the strong
                    winds which sweep down the vallies induced the inhabitants, at a time when the
                    materials for building were easily procured, to furnish many of these dwellings
                    with substantial porches; and such as have not this defence are seldom
                    unprovided with a projection of two large slates over their threshholds. Nor
                    will the singular beauty of the chimnies escape the eye of the attentive
                    traveller. Sometimes a low chimney, almost upon a level with the roof, is
                    overlaid with a slate, supported upon four slender pillars, to prevent the wind
                    from driving the smoke down the chimney. Others are of a quadrangular shape
                    rising one or two feet above the roof; which low square is surmounted by a tall
                    cylinder giving to the cottage chimney the most <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/19_0.jpg">[p. 19]</ref> beautiful shape in which it is ever seen. Nor will it be too
                    fanciful or refined to remark, as a general principle, that there is a pleasing
                    harmony between a tall chimney of this circular form and the living column of
                    smoke through the still air ascending from it. These dwellings, as has been
                    said, are built of rough unhewn stone; and they are roofed with slates which
                    were rudely taken from the quarry, before the present art of splitting them was
                    understood, and the slates are therefore rough and uneven in their surfaces.
                    Both the coverings and sides of the houses have furnished places of rest for the
                    seeds of lichens, mosses, fern, and flowers. Hence buildings, which in their
                    very form call to mind the processes of nature, do thus, by this vegetable garb
                    with which they are cloathed, appear to be received into the bosom of the living
                    principle of things, as it acts and exists among the woods and fields; and, by
                    their colour and their shape, affectingly direct the thoughts to that tranquil
                    course of nature and simplicity along which the humble-minded inhabitants have
                    through so many generations been led. Add the little garden with its shed for
                    bee-hives, its small beds of pot-herbs, and its border and patches of flowers
                    for Sunday posies, with sometimes a choice few too much prized to be plucked; an
                    orchard of proportioned size; a cheese-press often supported by some tree near
                    the door; a cluster of embowering sycamores for summer shade, with a tall Scotch
                    fir through which the winds sing when other trees are leafless; the little rill
                    or household spout murmuring in all seasons—combine these incidents and
                    images together, and you have the representative idea of a mountain cottage in
                    this country, so beautifully formed in itself and so richly adorned by the hand
                    of nature.</p>
               <p>Till within the last forty years there was no communication between any of these
                    vales by carriage roads; all bulky articles were transported on pack-horses.
                    But, owing to the population not being concentrated in villages but scattered,
                    the vallies themselves were intersected as now by innumerable lanes and pathways
                    leading from house to house and from field to field. These lanes where they are
                    fenced by stone walls are mostly bordered with ashes, hazels, wild roses, and
                    beds of tall fern, at their base; while the walls themselves if old, are
                    overspread with mosses, small ferns, wild strawberries, the geranium, and
                    lichens; and, if the wall happens to rest against a bank of earth, it is
                    sometimes almost wholly concealed by a rich facing of stone-fern. It is a great
                    advantage to a traveller or resident, that these numerous lanes and paths, if he
                    be a zealous admirer of nature, will introduce him, nay, will lead him on into
                    all the recesses of the country, so that the hidden treasures of its landscapes
                    will by an ever ready guide be laid open to his eyes.</p>
               <p>Likewise to the smallness of the several properties is owing the great number of
                    bridges over the brooks and torrents, and the daring and graceful neglect of
                    danger or accommodation with which so many of them are constructed, the rude-
                        <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/20_0.jpg">[p. 20]</ref> ness of the forms of some, and their endless variety. But,
                    when I speak of this rudeness, I must at the same time add that many of these
                    structures are in themselves models of elegance, as if they had been formed upon
                    principles of the most thoughtful architecture. It is to be regretted that these
                    monuments of the skill of our ancestors, and of that happiness of instinct by
                    which consummate beauty was produced, are disappearing fast; but sufficient
                    specimens remain to give a high gratification to the man of genuine taste. Such
                    travellers as may not be accustomed to pay attention to these things will excuse
                    me if I point out the proportion between the span and elevation of the arch, the
                    lightness of the parapet, and the graceful manner in which its curve follows
                    faithfully that of the arch.</p>
               <p>Upon this subject I have nothing further to notice, except the places of worship,
                    which have mostly a little school-house adjoining. The lowliness of simple
                    elegance of these churches and chapels, a well proportioned oblong with a porch,
                    in some instances a steeple tower, and in others nothing more than a small
                    belfry in which one or two bells hang visibly,—these are objects which,
                    though pleasing in their forms, must necessarily, more than any others in rural
                    scenery, derive their interest from the feelings of piety and reverence for the
                    modest virtues and simple manners of humble life with which they may be
                    contemplated. A man must be very insensible who would not be touched with
                    pleasure at the sight of the Chapel of Buttermere, which by its diminutive size,
                    so strikingly expresses how small must be the congregation there assembled, as
                    it were like one family, and proclaims at the same time to the passenger, in
                    connection with the surrounding mountains, the depth of that seclusion in which
                    the people live which has rendered necessary the building of a separate place of
                    worship for so few. A Patriot, calling to mind the image of the stately fabrics
                    of Canterbury, York, or Westminster, will find a heartfelt satisfaction in
                    presence of this lowly pile, as a monument of the wise institutions of our
                    country, and as evidence of the all-pervading and paternal care of that
                    venerable Establishment of which it is perhaps the humblest daughter.—The
                    edifice is scarcely larger than many of the single stones or fragments of rock
                    which are scattered near it.</p>
               <p>We have thus far confined our observations on this division of the subject to
                    that part of these Dales which runs far up into the mountains. In addition to
                    such objects as have been hitherto described, it may be mentioned that, as we
                    descend towards the open part of the Vales, we meet with the remains of ancient
                    Parks, and with old mansions of more stately architecture; and it may be
                    observed that to these circumstances the country owes whatever ornament it
                    retains of majestic and full-grown timber, as the remains of the park of the
                    ancient family of the Ratcliffs at Derwent-water, Gowbray-park, and the
                    venerable woods of Rydale. Through the more open part of the vales also are
                    scattered houses of <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/21_0.jpg">[p. 21]</ref> a middle rank between the pastoral cottage and the old
                    hall-residences of the more wealthy <emph>estatesman</emph> with more spacious
                    domains attached to them.</p>
               <p>Thus has been given a faithful description, the minuteness of which the Reader
                    will pardon, of the face of this country as it was and had been through
                    centuries till within the last forty years. Towards the head of these Dales was
                    found a perfect Republic of Shepherds and Agriculturists, among whom the plough
                    of each man was confined to the maintenance of his own family, or to the
                    occasional accommodation of his neighbour. Two or three cows furnished each
                    family with milk and cheese. The Chapel was the only edifice that presided over
                    these dwellings, the supreme head of this pure Commonwealth; the members of
                    which existed in the midst of a powerful empire, like an ideal society or an
                    organized community whose constitution had been imposed and regulated by the
                    mountains which protected it. Neither Knight nor Squire nor high-born Nobleman
                    was here; but many of these humble sons of the hills had a consciousness that
                    the land, which they walked over and tilled, had for more than five hundred
                    years been possessed by men of their name and blood—and venerable was the
                    transition when a curious traveller, descending from the heart of the mountains,
                    had come to some ancient manorial residence in the more open part of the vales,
                    which, with the rights attached to its proprietor, connected the almost
                    visionary mountain Republic which he had been contemplating with the substantial
                    frame of society as existing in the laws and constitution of a mighty
                    empire.</p>
               <p>Such, as I have said, was the appearance of things till within these last forty
                    years. A practice which by a strange abuse of terms has been denominated
                    ornamental gardening, was at that time, becoming generally prevalent over
                    England. In union with an admiration of this art, and in some instances in
                    opposition to it, had been generated a relish for select parts of natural
                    scenery; and Travellers, instead of confining their observations to Towns,
                    Manufactures, or Mines, began (a thing till then unheard of) to wander over the
                    Island in search of sequestered spots which they might have accidentally learnt
                    were distinguished for the sublimity and beauty of the forms of nature there to
                    be seen. Dr. Brown the celebrated author of the “Estimate of the Manners and
                    Principles of the Times,” &amp;c. published a letter to a friend in which the
                    attractions of the Vale of Keswick were delineated with a powerful pencil and
                    the feeling of a genuine enthusiast. Gray, the Poet followed; and the report,
                    which he gave, was circulated among his friends. He died soon after his forlorn
                    and melancholy pilgrimage to the Vale of Keswick; and the record which he left
                    behind him of what he had seen and felt in this journey excited that pensive
                    interest with which the human mind is ever disposed to listen to the farewell
                    words of a man of genius. The journal of Gray feelingly recorded the manner in
                    which the gloom of ill health and low spirits had been irradiated by objects
                    most beautiful and sublime which the Author’s <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/22_0.jpg">[p. 22]</ref> powers of mind enabled him to describe with distinctness and
                    unaffected simplicity. The Vale of Grasmere is thus happily discriminated at the
                    close of his description.—“Not a single red tile, no gentleman’s flaring
                    house or garden walls, break in upon the repose of this little unsuspected
                    paradise; but all is peace, rusticity, and happy poverty, in its neatest and
                    most becoming attire.”</p>
               <p>What is here so justly said of Grasmere applied almost equally to all its sister
                    vales. It was well for the undisturbed pleasure of the Poet’s mind that he had
                    no forebodings of what was so soon after to take place; and it might have been
                    hoped that these words, at once the dictate of a sympathetic heart, a pure
                    imagination, and a genuine taste, would almost of themselves have preserved the
                    ancient franchises of this and other kindred mountain retirements from trespass
                    or intrusion, or (shall I dare to say?) would have secured scenes so consecrated
                    from profanation. The Lakes had now become celebrated; the mania of ornamental
                    gardening and prospect hunting had spread wide; visitors flocked hither from all
                    parts of the Island; the fancies of some of these were so strongly smitten that
                    they became settlers; and numerous violations soon ensued.</p>
               <p>This beautiful country has, in a great variety of instances, suffered from the
                    spirit of tasteless and capricious innovation. No one can now travel through the
                    more frequented tracts, without finding at almost every turn the venerable and
                    pure simplicity of nature vitiated by some act of inconsiderate and impertinent
                    art; without being offended by an introduction of discordant objects, disturbing
                    every where that peaceful harmony of form and colour which had been through a
                    long lapse of ages most happily preserved.</p>
               <p>All gross transgressions of this kind in matters of taste originate in a feeling
                    natural and honourable to the human mind, viz., the pleasure which we receive
                    from distinct ideas and from the perception of order, regularity, and
                    contrivance. Now unpractised minds receive these impressions only from objects
                    between which there exists eternally a strong demarkation; hence the pleasure
                    with which such minds are smitten by formality and harsh contrast. But I would
                    beg of those who, under the control of this craving for distinct ideas, are
                    hastily setting about the production of food by which it may be gratified, to
                    temper their impatience, to look carefully about them, to observe and to watch;
                    and they will find gradually growing within them a sense by which they will be
                    enabled to perceive in a country so lavishly gifted by nature an ever-renewing
                    variety of forms which will be marked out with a precision that will satisfy
                    their desires. Moreover, a new habit of pleasure will be forming in the mind the
                    opposite of this, viz., a habit arising out of the perception of the fine
                    gradations by which in nature one thing passes away into another, and the
                    boundaries that constitute individuality disappear in one instance only to be
                    renewed in another under a more alluring form. My meaning will at once be
                    obvious to those who remember the hill of Dunmallet at the foot of <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/23_0.jpg">[p. 23]</ref> Ulswater divided into different portions, as it once was by
                    avenues of fir trees with a green and almost perpendicular lane descending down
                    the steep hill through each avenue; who can recall to mind the delight with
                    which they might as children have looked at this quaint appearance; and are
                    enabled to contrast that remembrance with the pleasure which the more practiced
                    eye of mature age would create for itself from the image of the same hill
                    overgrown with self-planted wood, each tree springing up in the situation best
                    suited to its kind, and with that shape which the same situation constrained or
                    suffered it to take. What endless melting and playing into each other of forms
                    and colours does the one offer to a mind at once attentive and active; and how
                    insipid and lifeless, compared with it, appear those parts of its former
                    exhibition with which a child, a peasant perhaps, or a citizen unfamiliar with
                    natural imagery, would have been most delighted! I cannot however omit observing
                    that the disfigurement, which this country has undergone has not proceeded
                    wholly from those common feelings of human nature which have been referred to as
                    the primary sources of bad taste in rural scenery; another cause must be added,
                    which has chiefly shewn itself in its effect upon buildings. I mean a constraint
                    or warping of the natural mind arising out of a sense that, this country being
                    an object of general admiration, every new house would be looked at and
                    commented upon either for approbation or censure. Hence all the deformity and
                    ungracefulness which ever pursue the steps of constraint or affectation. Men,
                    who in Leicestershire or Northamptonshire would probably have built a modest
                    dwelling like those of their sensible neighbours, have been turned out of their
                    course; and acting a part, no wonder if, having had little experience, they act
                    it ill. Moreover, the craving for prospect which is immoderate, particularly in
                    new settlers, has rendered it impossible that buildings, whatever might have
                    been their architecture, should in most instances be ornamental to the
                    landscape; starting, as they do on the summits of naked hills in staring
                    contrast to the snugness and privacy of the ancient houses.</p>
               <p>I do not condemn in any man a desire that his residence and possessions should
                    draw upon them the approbation of the judicious; nor do I censure attempts to
                    decorate them for that purpose. I rather applaud both the one and the other; and
                    would shew in what manner the end may be best attained. The rule is simple; with
                    respect to grounds,—work, where you can, in the spirit of nature with an
                    invisible hand of art. Planting, and a removal of wood, may thus and thus only
                    be carried on with good effect; and the like may be said of building, if
                    antiquity which may be stiled the copartner and sister of nature, be not denied
                    the respect to which she is entitled. I have already spoken of the beautiful
                    forms of the ancient mansions of this country, and of the happy manner in which
                    they harmonize with the forms of nature. Why cannot these be taken as a model
                    and modern internal convenience be confined within their external grace and
                    dignity? But, <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/24_0.jpg">[p. 24]</ref> should expense to be avoided or difficulties to be overcome
                    prevent a close adherence to this model, still it might be followed to a certain
                    degree in the style of architecture and in the choice of situation, if the
                    craving for prospect were mitigated by those considerations of comfort, shelter,
                    and convenience, which used to be chiefly sought after. But should an aversion
                    to old fashions unfortunately exist accompanied with a desire to transplant into
                    the cold and stormy North, the elegancies of a villa formed upon a model taken
                    from countries with a milder climate, I will adduce a passage from an English
                    Poet, the divine Spenser, which will shew in what manner such a plan may be
                    realized without injury to the native beauty of these scenes. <quote>

               <p>I have been treating of the erection of houses or mansions suited to a grand and
                    beautiful region; and I have laid it down as a position that they should be “not
                    obvious, nor obtrusive, but retired;” and the reasons for this, though they have
                    been little adverted to, are evident. Mountainous countries more frequently and
                    forcibly than others, remind us of the power of the elements as it is exhibited
                    in winds, snows, and torrents, and accordingly make the notion of exposure very
                    unpleasing; while shelter and comfort are in proportion necessary and
                    acceptable. Far-winding vallies, which are difficult of access, and our feelings
                    of simplicity which are habitually connected with mountain retirements, prompt
                    us to turn from ostentation as a thing there eminently unnatural and out of
                    place. A mansion amid such scenes can never have sufficient dignity or interest
                    to become principal in the landscape and render the mountains, lakes, or
                    torrents, by which it may be surrounded, a subordinate part of the view; nor are
                    the grand features of nature to be absorbed by the puny efforts of human art. It
                    is, I grant, easy to conceive that an ancient castellated mansion hanging over a
                    precipice or raised upon an island or the peninsula of a lake, like that of
                    Kilchurn Castle near Loch <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/25_0.jpg">[p. 25]</ref> Awe, may not want, whether deserted or inhabited, that
                    majesty which shall enable it to preside for a moment in the spectator’s
                    thoughts over the high mountains among which it is embosomed; but its titles are
                    from antiquity—a power which is readily submitted to upon occasions as the
                    viceregent of Nature; it is respected as having owed its existence to the
                    necessity of things—as a monument of security in times of disturbance and
                    danger long passed away—as a record of the pomp and violence of passion,
                    and a symbol of the wisdom of law—it bears a countenance of authority
                    which is not impaired by decay. These honours render it worthy of its situation;
                    and to which of these honours can a modern edifice pretend? Obtruding itself in
                    rivalry with the grandeur of Nature, it only displays the presumption and
                    caprice of its individual founder, or the class to which he belongs. But, in a
                    flat or merely undulating country, a Gentleman’s Mansion may with propriety
                    become a principal feature in the landscape; and, itself being a work of art,
                    works and traces of artificial ornament may without censure be extended around
                    it, as they will be referred to the common centre, the house; the right of which
                    to impress within certain limits a character of obvious ornament will not be
                    denied, where there are no conspicuous or commanding forms of Nature to dispute
                    it or set it aside. Now to a want of the perception of this difference, and to
                    the causes before assigned, may chiefly be attributed the disfigurement which
                    the Country of the Lakes has undergone from persons who may have built,
                    demolished, and planted, with full confidence that every change and addition was
                    or would become an improvement.</p>
               <p>The principle which ought to determine the position, apparent size, and
                    architecture of a house, viz., that it should be so constructed, and (if large)
                    so much of it hidden, as to admit of its being gently incorporated with the
                    scenery of Nature—should also determine its colour. Sir Joshua Reynolds
                    used to say “if you would fix upon the best colour for your house, turn up a
                    stone, or pluck up a handful of grass by the roots, and see what is the colour
                    of the soil where the house is to stand, and let that be your choice.” Of course
                    the precept, given in conversation, could not have been meant to be taken
                    literally. For example in Low Furness, where the soil from its strong
                    impregnation with iron is universally of a deep red, if this rule were strictly
                    followed, the house also must be of a glaring red; in other places it must be of
                    a sullen black; which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance. The rule
                    however, as a general guide, is good; and in agricultural districts where large
                    tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough, particularly if (the face of the
                    country being undulating) they are held up to view, this rule, though not to be
                    implicitly adhered to, should never be lost sight of, that is, the colour of the
                    house ought, if possible, to have a cast or shade of the colour of the soil. The
                    principle is that the house must harmonize with the surrounding landscape;
                    accordingly, in mountainous countries, with still more confi- <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/26_0.jpg">[p. 26]</ref> dence may it be said, “look at the rocks and those parts of
                    the mountains where the soil is visible, and they will furnish a safe general
                    direction.” Nevertheless, it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large
                    a proportion to the rest of the landscape, and may be of such a tone of colour
                    that the rule may not even here admit of being implicitly followed. For
                    instance, the chief defect in the colouring of the Country of the Lakes (which
                    is most strongly felt in the summer season) is an over-prevalence of a bluish
                    tint, which the green of the herbage, the fern, and the woods, does not
                    sufficiently counteract. This blue tint proceeds from the diffused water, and
                    still more from the rocks which the reader will remember are generally of this
                    colour. If a house therefore should stand where this defect prevails, I have no
                    hesitation in saying that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the
                    best that could be chosen. A tint ought to be introduced approaching nearer to
                    those which, in the technical language of painters, are
                    called <emph>warm</emph>: this, if happily selected, would not disturb, but
                    would animate the landscape. How often do we see this exemplified upon a small
                    scale by the native cottages, in cases where the glare of white wash has been
                    subdued by time and enriched by weather-stains. No harshness is then seen; but
                    one of these cottages thus coloured, will often form a central point to a
                    landscape by which the whole shall be connected, and the influence of pleasure
                    diffused over all the objects of which the picture is composed. Where however
                    the cold blue tint of the rocks is animated by hues of the iron tinge, the
                    colour cannot be too closely imitated; and it will be produced of itself by the
                    stones hewn from the adjoining quarry, and by the mortar which may be tempered
                    with the most gravelly part of the soil. But, should the mason object to this,
                    as they will do, and insist upon the mortar being tempered by blue gravel from
                    the bed of the river, and say that the house must be rough-cast, otherwise it
                    cannot be kept dry, then the builder of taste will set about contriving such
                    means as may enable him to come the nearest to the effect aimed at.</p>
               <p>The supposed necessity of rough-cast to keep out rain in houses not built of hewn
                    stone or brick, has tended greatly to injure English landscape, and the
                    neighbourhood of these Lakes especially, by furnishing such an apt occasion for
                    whitening buildings. I will therefore say a few words upon this subject; because
                    many persons, not deficient in taste, are admirers of this colour for rural
                    residences. The reasons are manifold; first, as is obvious, the air of
                    cleanliness and neatness which is thus given not only to an individual house,
                    but, where the practice is general, to the whole face of the country; which
                    moral associations are so powerful that, in the minds of many, they take place
                    of every other relating to such objects. But what has been already said upon the
                    subject of cottages must have convinced men of feeling and imagination, that a
                    human habitation of the humblest class may be rendered more deeply interesting
                    to the affections, and far more pleasing to the <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/27_0.jpg">[p. 27]</ref> eye, by other influences than by a sprightly tone of colour
                    spread over its outside. I do not however mean to deny that a small white
                    building, embowered in trees, may in some situations be a delightful and
                    animating object—in no way injurious to the landscape; but this only where
                    it sparkles from the midst of a thick shade, and in rare and solitary instances;
                    especially if the country be in itself rich and pleasing and full of grand
                    forms. On the sides of bleak and desolate moors, one is indeed thankful for the
                    sight of white Cottages and white houses plentifully scattered, where without
                    these perhaps every thing would be chearless: this is said however with
                    hesitation, and in the sleep of some of the higher faculties of the mind. But I
                    have certainly seen such buildings glittering at sunrise and in wandering lights
                    with no common pleasure. The continental Traveller also will remember that the
                    Convents hanging from the rocks of the Rhine, the Rhone, the Danube, or among
                    the Appenines or the Mountains of Spain, are not looked at with less complacency
                    when, as is often the case, they happen to be of a brilliant white. But this is
                    perhaps owing, in no small degree, to the contrast of that lively colour with
                    the feeling of gloom associated with monastic life, and to the general want of
                    rural residences of smiling and attractive appearance in those countries.</p>
               <p>The objections to white as a colour in large spots or masses in landscape,
                    especially in a mountainous country, are insurmountable. In nature it is
                    scarcely ever found but in small objects, such as flowers; or in those which are
                    transitory, as the clouds, foam of rivers, and snow. Mr. Gilpin, who notices
                    this, has also recorded the just remark of Mr. Locke of N—— that
                    white destroys the <emph>gradations</emph> of distance, and therefore an object
                    of pure white can scarcely ever be managed with good effect in landscape
                    painting. Five or six white houses, scattered over a valley, by their
                    obtrusiveness dot the surface and divide it into triangles or other mathematical
                    figures which haunt the eye and disturb that repose which might otherwise be
                    perfect. I have seen a single white house materially impair the majesty of a
                    mountain, cutting away by a harsh separation the whole of the base below the
                    point on which the house stood. Thus was the apparent size of the mountain
                    reduced not by the interposition of another object in a manner to call forth the
                    imagination, which will give more than the eye loses; but what had been
                    abstracted in this case was left visible; and the mountain appeared to take its
                    beginning or to rise from the line of the house instead of its own natural base.
                    But, if I may express my own individual feeling, it is after sunset at the
                    coming on of twilight that white objects are most to be complained of. The
                    solemnity and quietness of nature at that time is always marred and often
                    destroyed by them. When the ground is covered with snow, they are inoffensive;
                    and in moonshine they are always pleasing—it is a tone of light with which
                    they accord; and the dimness of the scene is enlivened by an object at once
                    conspicuous and chearful. I will con- <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/28_0.jpg">[p. 28]</ref> clude this subject with noticing that the cold slaty colour,
                    which many persons who have heard the white condemned have adopted in its stead,
                    must be disapproved of for the reason already given. The flaring yellow runs
                    into the opposite extreme, and is still more censurable. Upon the whole, the
                    safest colour for general use is something between a cream and a dust colour
                    commonly called stone-colour—there are among the Lakes examples of this
                    which need not be pointed out.</p>
               <p>The principle which we have taken for our guide, viz., that the house should be
                    so formed and of such apparent size and colour as to admit of its being gently
                    incorporated with the scenery of nature, should also be applied to the
                    management of the grounds and plantations, and is here more urgently needed; for
                    it is from abuses in this department, far more even than from the introduction
                        of <emph>exotics</emph> in architecture, (if the phrase may be used) that
                    this country has suffered. Larch and fir plantations have been spread every
                    where, not merely with a view to profit, but in many instances for the sake of
                    ornament. To those who plant for profit, and are thrusting every other tree out
                    of the way to make room for their favourite the Larch, I would utter first a
                    regret that they should have selected these lovely vales for their vegetable
                    manufactory, when there is so much barren and irreclaimable land in other parts
                    of the Island which might have been had for this purpose at a far cheaper rate.
                    And I will also beg leave to represent to them that they ought not to be carried
                    away by flattering promises from the speedy growth of this tree; because, in
                    rich soils and sheltered situations, the wood, though it thrives fast, is full
                    of sap, and of little value, and is likewise very subject to ravage from the
                    attacks of insects and from blight. Accordingly in Scotland, where planting is
                    much better understood, and carried on upon an incomparably larger scale than
                    among us, good soil and sheltered situations are appropriated to the oak, the
                    ash, and other native deciduous trees; and the larch is now generally confined
                    to barren and exposed ground. There the plant, which is a hardy one, is of
                    slower growth; much less liable to the injuries which I have mentioned; and the
                    timber is of better quality. But there are many whose circumstances permit them,
                    and whose taste leads them, to plant with little regard to profit; and others
                    less wealthy who have such a lively feeling of the native beauty of these
                    scenes, that they are laudably not unwilling to make some sacrifices to heighten
                    it. Both these classes of persons I would entreat to enquire of themselves
                    wherein that beauty which they admire consists. They would then see that, after
                    the feeling has been gratified which prompts us to gather round our dwelling a
                    few flowers and shrubs which, from the circumstance of their not being native,
                    may, by their very looks, remind us that they owe their existence to our hands
                    and their prosperity to our care, they will see that, after this natural desire
                    has been provided for, <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/29_0.jpg">[p. 29]</ref> the course of all beyond has been predetermined by the spirit
                    of the place. Before I proceed with this subject, I will prepare my way with a
                    remark of general application by reminding those, who are not satisfied with the
                    restraint thus laid upon them, that they are liable to a charge of inconsistency
                    when they are so eager to change the face of that country, the native
                    attractions of which by the art of erecting their habitations in it they have
                    emphatically and conspicuously acknowledged. And surely there is not in this
                    country a single spot that would not have, if well managed, sufficient dignity
                    to support itself unaided by the productions of other climates or by elaborate
                    decorations which might be becoming elsewhere.</p>
               <p>But to return; having adverted to the considerations which justify the
                    introduction of a few exotic plants, provided they be confined almost to the
                    doors of the house, we may add, that a transition should be contrived without
                    abruptness from these foreigners to the rest of the shrubs, which ought to be of
                    the kinds scattered by nature through the woods—holly, broom, wild rose,
                    elder, dogberry, white and black thorn, &amp;c., either these only, or such as
                    are carefully selected in consequence of their uniting in form, and harmonizing
                    in colour with them, especially, with respect to colour, when the tints are most
                    diversified, as in autumn and spring. The various sorts of fruit and
                    blossom-bearing trees usually found in orchards, to which may be added those of
                    the woods; the wilding, black cherry tree, and wild cluster cherry (here called
                    heck-berry) may be happily admitted as an intermediate link between the shrubs
                    and the forest trees; which last ought almost entirely to be such as are natives
                    of the country, oak, ash, birch, mountain ash, &amp;c. &amp;c. Of the birch, one
                    of the most beautiful of the native trees, it may be noticed, that, in dry and
                    rocky situations, it outstrips even the larch which many persons are tempted to
                    plant merely on account of the speed of its growth. Sycamore, and the Scotch fir
                    (which, when it has room to spread out its arms, is a noble tree) may be placed
                    with advantage near the house; for, from their massiveness, they unite well with
                    buildings, and in some situations with rocks also; having in their forms and
                    apparent substances, the effect of something intermediate betwixt the
                    immovableness and solidity of stone and the sprays and foliage of the lighter
                    trees. If these general rules be just, what shall we say to whole acres of
                    artificial shrubbery and exotic trees among rocks and dashing torrents with
                    their own wild wood in sight—where we have the whole contents of the
                    nursery-man’s catalogue jumbled together—colour at war with colour, and
                    form with form—among the most peaceful subjects of nature’s kingdom every
                    where discord, distraction, and bewilderment! But this deformity, bad as it is,
                    is not so obtrusive as the small patches and large tracts of larch plantations
                    which are over-running the hill-sides. To justify our condemnation of these, let
                    us again recur to nature. The process by which she forms woods and forests, is
                    as follows. Seeds are scattered <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/30_0.jpg">[p. 30]</ref> indiscriminately by winds, brought by waters, and dropped by
                    birds. They perish or produce, according as the soil upon which they fall is
                    suited to them; and under the same dependence the seedling or sucker, if not
                    cropped by animals, thrives, and the tree grows, sometimes single, taking its
                    own shape without constraint, but for the most part being compelled to conform
                    itself to some law imposed upon it by its neighbours. From low and sheltered
                    places vegetation travels upwards to the more exposed; and the young plants are
                    protected, and to a certain degree fashioned, by those which have preceded them.
                    The continuous mass of foliage which would thus be produced is broken by rocks
                    or by glades or open places where the brouzing of animals has prevented the
                    growth of wood. As vegetation ascends, the winds begin also to bear their part
                    in moulding the forms of the trees; but, thus mutually protected, trees, though
                    not of the hardiest kind, are enabled to climb high up the mountains. Gradually
                    however, by the nature of the ground and by increasing exposure, as top is put
                    to their ascent; the hardy trees only are left; these also, by little and
                    little, give way; and a wild and irregular boundary is established, which, while
                    it is graceful in its outline, is never contemplated without some feeling more
                    or less distinct of the powers of nature by which it has been imposed.</p>
               <p>Contrast the liberty and law under which this is carried on, as a joint work of
                    nature and time, with the disheartening necessities, restrictions, and
                    disadvantages, under which the artificial planter must proceed, even he whom
                    long observation and fine feeling have best qualified to tread in the path of
                    nature. In the first place his trees, however well chosen and adapted to their
                    several situations, must generally all start at the same time; and this
                    circumstance would of itself prevent that fine connection of parts, that
                    sympathy and organization, if I may so express myself, which pervades the whole
                    of a natural wood, and which appears to the eye in its single trees, its masses
                    of foliage, and their various colours when they are held up to view on the side
                    of a mountain; or, when spread over a valley, they are looked down upon from an
                    eminence. It is then impossible under any circumstances for the artificial
                    planter to rival the beauty of nature. But a moment’s thought will shew that, if
                    ten thousand of this spiky tree, the larch, are stuck in at once upon the side
                    of a hill, they can grow up into nothing but deformity; that, while they are
                    suffered to stand, an absolute and insurmountable obstacle will prevent the
                    realization of any of those appearances which we have described as the chief
                    cause of the beauty of a natural wood.</p>
               <p>It must be acknowledged that the larch, till it has outgrown the size of a shrub,
                    has, when looked at singly, some elegance in its form and appearance, especially
                    in spring when decorated by the pink tassels of its blossoms; but as a tree, it
                    is less than any other pleasing; its branches (for <emph>boughs</emph> it has
                    none) have no variety in the youth of the tree, and little dignity even when it
                    attains its full growth;  <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/31_0.jpg">[p. 31]</ref>
                  <emph>leaves</emph> it cannot be said to have; consequently neither affords
                    shade, nor shelter. In spring it becomes green long before the native trees; and
                    its green is so peculiar and vivid, that, finding nothing to harmonize with it,
                    it makes a speck and deformity in the landscape. In summer when all other trees
                    are in their pride, it is of a dingy lifeless hue, and in winter appears
                    absolutely dead. In this respect it is lamentably distinguished from every other
                    tree of the forest. If an attempt be made to mingle thickets, or a certain
                    proportion of other forest trees, with the larch,—its horizontal branches
                    intolerantly cut them down as with a scythe or force them to spindle up to keep
                    pace with it. The spike, in which it terminates, renders it impossible, when it
                    is planted in numbers, that the several trees should ever blend together so as
                    to form a mass or masses of wood. Add thousands to tens of thousands, and the
                    appearance is still the same—a collection of separate individual trees
                    which obstinately present themselves as such; and, from whatever point they are
                    looked at, if but seen, may be counted upon the fingers. Sunshine or shadow has
                    little power to adorn the surface of such a wood; and the trees not carrying up
                    their heads, the wind produces among them no majestic undulations. It is indeed,
                    true that, in countries where the larch is a native, and where without
                    interruption it may sweep from valley to valley and from hill to hill, a sublime
                    image may be produced by such a forest in the same manner as by one composed of
                    any other single tree to the spreading of which no limits can be assigned. For
                    sublimity will never be wanting, where the sense of innumerable multitude is
                    lost in, and alternates with, that of intense unity; and to the ready perception
                    of this effect similarity and almost identity of individual form and monotony of
                    colour contribute. But this feeling is confined to the native immeasurable
                    forest; no artificial plantation can give it.</p>
               <p>The foregoing observations will, I hope, (as nothing has been condemned or
                    recommended without a substantial reason) have some influence upon those who
                    plant for ornament mainly. To those, who plant for profit, I have already
                    spoken. Let me then entreat that the native deciduous trees may be left in
                    complete possession of the lower ground; and that plantations of larch, if
                    introduced at all, may be confined to the higher and more barren tracts.
                    Interposition of rocks would there break the dreary uniformity of which we have
                    been complaining; and the winds would take hold of the trees, and imprint upon
                    their shapes a wildness congenial to their situation.</p>
               <p>Having determined what kinds of trees must be wholly rejected, or at least very
                    sparingly used by those who are unwilling to disfigure the country; and having
                    shewn what kinds ought to be chosen; I should have given, if I had not already
                    overstepped my limits, a few practical rules for the <emph>manner</emph> in
                    which trees ought to be disposed in planting. But to this subject I should
                    attach little importance, if I could succeed in banishing such trees as
                    introduce deformity, and could prevail <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/32_0.jpg">[p. 32]</ref> upon the Proprietor to confine himself either to those which
                    form the native woods, or to such as accord with them. This is indeed the main
                    point; for, much as these scenes have been injured by what has been taken from
                    them—buildings, trees and woods, either through negligence, necessity,
                    avarice, or caprice—it is not these removals, but the
                        harsh <emph>additions</emph> that have been made, which are the worst
                    grievance—a standing and unavoidable annoyance. Often have I felt this
                    distinction with mingled satisfaction and regret; for if no positive deformity
                    or discordance be substituted or superinduced, such is the benignity of nature
                    that, take away from her beauty after beauty and ornament after ornament, her
                    appearance cannot be lastingly marred;—the scars, if any be left, will
                    gradually disappear before a healing spirit; and what remains will still be
                    soothing and pleasing.—“Many hearts;” says a living Poet speaking of a

               <p>There are few ancient woods left in this part of England upon which such
                    indiscriminate ravage could now be committed. But out of the numerous copses
                    fine woods might in time be raised, probably without any sacrifice of profit, by
                    leaving at the periodical fellings a due proportion of the healthiest trees to
                    grow up into timber.—This plan has fortunately, in many instances, been
                    adopted; and they, who have set the example, are entitled to the thanks of all
                    persons of taste. As to the management of planting with reasonable attention to
                    ornament, let the images of nature be your guide, and the whole secret lurks in
                    a few words; thickets or underwoods—single trees—trees clustered or
                    in groups—groves—unbroken woods, but with varied masses of
                    foliage—glades—invisible or winding boundaries—in rocky
                    districts a seemly proportion of rock left wholly bare, and other parts half
                    hidden—disagreeable objects concealed, and formal lines broken—trees
                    climbing up to the horizon, and in some places ascending from its sharp edge in
                    which they are rooted, with the whole body of the tree appearing to stand in the
                    clear sky—in other parts woods surmounted by rocks utterly bare and naked,
                    which add to the sense of height as if vegetation could not thither be carried,
                    and impress a feeling of duration, power of resistance, and security from
                    change.</p>
               <p>I have been induced to speak thus at length with a wish to preserve the native
                    beauty of this delightful district, because still farther changes in its
                    appearance must inevitably follow, from the change of inhabitants and owners
                    which is rapidly <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/33_0.jpg">[p. 33]</ref> taking place.—About the same time that strangers began
                    to be attracted to the country, and to feel a wish to settle in it, the
                    difficulty, which would have stood in the way of their procuring situations, was
                    lessened by an unfortunate alteration in the circumstances of the native
                    Peasantry, proceeding from a cause which then began to operate, and is now felt
                    in every house. The family of each man, whether estatesman or farmer, formerly
                    had a twofold support; first, the produce of his lands and flocks; and secondly
                    the profit which was drawn from the employment of the women and children, as
                    manufacturers; spinning their own wool in their own houses (which was done
                    chiefly in the winter season) and carrying it to market for sale. Hence, however
                    numerous the children, the income of the family kept pace with its increase.
                    But, by the invention and universal application of machinery, this second
                    resource has been almost wholly cut off; the gains being so far reduced, as not
                    to be sought after but by a few aged persons disabled from other employment.
                    Doubtless the invention of machinery has not been to these people a pure loss;
                    for the profits arising from home-manufactures operated as a strong temptation
                    to choose that mode of labour in neglect of husbandry. They also participate in
                    the general benefit which the Island has derived from the increased value of the
                    produce of land, brought about by the establishment of manufactories, and in the
                    consequent quickening of agricultural industry. But this is far from making them
                    amends; and now, that home-manufactures are nearly done away, though the women
                    and children might at many seasons of the year employ themselves with advantage
                    in the fields beyond what they are accustomed to do, yet still all possible
                    exertion in this way cannot be rationally expected from persons whose
                    agricultural knowledge is so confined, and above all where there must
                    necessarily be so small a capital. The consequence, then, is—that, farmers
                    being no longer able to maintain themselves upon small farms, several are united
                    into one, and the buildings go to decay or are destroyed; and that the lands of
                    the estatesmen being mortgaged and the owners constrained to part with them,
                    they fall into the hands of wealthy purchasers, who in like manner unite and
                    consolidate; and if they wish to become residents, erect new mansions out of the
                    ruins of the ancient cottages whose little enclosures, with all the wild graces
                    which grew out of them and around them, disappear. The feudal tenure of these
                    estates has indeed done something towards checking this influx of new settlers;
                    but so strong is the inclination that these galling restraints are endured; and
                    it is probable that in a few years the country of the Lakes will fall almost
                    entirely into the possession of Gentry, either strangers or natives. It is then
                    much to be wished, that a better taste should prevail among these new
                    proprietors; and, as they cannot be expected to leave things to themselves, that
                    skill and knowledge should prevent unnecessary deviations from that path of
                    simplicity and beauty in which, without design and unconsciously, their humble
                    predecessors have moved. In this wish the author will be <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/34_0.jpg">[p. 34]</ref> joined by persons of pure taste throughout the whole Island,
                    who by their visits, often repeated, to the Lakes to the North of England,
                    testify that they deem the district a sort of national property, in which every
                    man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to
                    enjoy.</p>
               <p>The Writer may now express a hope that the end, which was proposed in the
                    commencement of this Introduction, has not been wholly unattained; and that
                    there is no impropriety in connecting these latter remarks with the Etchings now
                    offered to the public. For it is certain that, if the evil complained of should
                    continue to spread, these Vales, notwithstanding their lakes, rivers, torrents,
                    and surrounding rocks and mountains, will lose their chief recommendation for
                    the eye of the painter and the man of imagination and feeling. And, upon the
                    present occasion, the Artist is bound to acknowledge that, if the fruit of his
                    labours have any value, it is owing entirely to the models which he has had
                    before him, in a country which retained till lately an appearance unimpaired of
                        <hi rendition="#smallcaps">Man</hi> and <hi rendition="#smallcaps">Nature</hi> animated, as it were, by one spirit for the production of

               <p>
                  <hi rendition="#smallcaps">In</hi> the Introduction to this Work a survey has
                    been given of the face of the country, in which our English Lakes are situated
                    which will not perhaps prove unserviceable even to Natives and Residents,
                    however well acquainted with its appearance; as it will probably direct their
                    attention to some objects which they have overlooked, and will exhibit others
                    under relations of which they have been unconscious. I will now address myself
                    more particularly to the Stranger and the Traveller; and, without attempting to
                    give a formal Tour through the country, and without binding myself servilely to
                    accompany the Etchings, I will attach to the Work such directions, descriptions,
                    and remarks, as I hope will confer an additional interest upon the Views, and
                    will also be of use to a person preparing for a first visit to these scenes, and
                    during his progress through them.—To begin then with the time which he
                    ought to choose;—Mr. West recommends the interval from the beginning of
                    June to the end of August; and the two latter months, being a season of vacation
                    and leisure, are those which are generally selected; but they are by no means
                    the best; for the disadvantages belonging to them are many and great. The
                    principal are, the monotonous green of the Mountains and of the Woods, and the
                    embrowned colour of the grass in the Vallies. This however is variegated and
                    enlivened after hay-making begins, which is much later than in the southern
                    parts of the Island. An objection which will be more strongly felt, is rainy
                    weather, which often sets in at this period with a vigour, and continues with a
                    perseverance, that may remind the disappointed and dejected Traveller of the wet
                    season between the Tropics; or of those deluges of rain which fall among the
                    Abyssinian Mountains for the annual supply of the Nile. Hence, as a very large
                    majority of strangers visit the Lakes at this season, the country labours under
                    the ill repute of being scarcely ever free from rain.—The months of
                    September and October, (particularly October) are generally attended with much
                    finer weather; and the scenery is then, beyond comparison, more diversified,
                    more splendid and beautiful; but, on the other hand, short days prevent long
                    excursions, and sharp and chill gales are unfavorable to parties of pleasure out
                    of doors. Nevertheless the beauty of this country in Autumn so far surpasses
                    that of Midsummer, that to the sincere admirer of Nature, who is in good health
                    and spirits and at liberty to make a choice, the six weeks following the first
                    of September may be recommended in preference to July and August.—For
                    there is no inconvenience arising from the Season which to such a person would
                    not be amply recompensed by the <emph>Autumnal</emph> appearance of any of the
                    more retired Vallies, into which discordant plantations and unsuitable buildings
                    have not yet found entrance.—In such spots at this season, there is an
                    admirable and affecting compass and proportion of natural harmony in form and
                    colour, through the whole scale of objects; in the tender green of the
                    after-grass upon the meadows interspersed with islands of grey or mossy rocks
                    crowned by shrubs and trees; in the irregular inclosures of standing corn or
                    stubble-fields in like manner broken; in the mountain-sides glowing with fern of
                    divers colours; in the calm blue Lakes or River-pools; and in the foliage of the
                    trees through all the tints of Autumn, from the pale and brilliant yellow of the
                    birch and ash to the deep greens of the unfaded oak and the alder, and of the
                    ivy upon the rocks, the trees, and the cottages. Yet as most travellers are
                    either stinted or stint themselves for time, I would recommend the space between
                    the middle or last week in May and the middle or last week of June as affording
                    the best combination of long days, fine weather, and variety of impressions. Few
                    of the native trees are indeed then in full leaf, but for whatever may be
                    wanting in depth of shade, far more than an equivalent will be found in the
                    diversity of foliage, in the blossoms of the fruit- and berry-bearing Trees
                    which abound in the woods, and in the golden flowers of the broom and other
                    shrubs, with which many of the copses are variegated. In those woods, also, and
                    on those mountain-sides which have a northern aspect, and in the deep dells,
                    many of the earlier spring-flowers still linger; while the open and sunny places
                    are stocked with the flowers of approaching summer. And, besides, is not an
                    exquisite pleasure still untasted by him who has not heard the <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/36_0.jpg">[p. 36]</ref> choir of Linnets and Thrushes chaunting their love-songs in
                    the copses, woods, and hedge-rows, of a mountainous country; safe from the birds
                    of prey, which build in the inaccessible crags, and are at all hours seen or
                    heard wheeling about in the air? The number of those formidable Creatures is the
                    cause why in the narrow vallies there are no sky-larks; as the Destroyer would
                    be enabled to dart upon them from the near and surrounding crags, before they
                    could descend to their ground nests, for protection. Neither are Nightingales
                    here to be heard; but almost all the other tribes of our English warblers are
                    numerous; and their notes, when listened to by the side of broad still waters,
                    or when heard in unison with the murmuring of mountain brooks, have much more
                    power over the heart, and the imagination than in other places.—There is
                    also an imaginative influence in the voice of the Cuckoo, when that voice has
                    taken possession of a deep mountain Valley, which is very different from any
                    thing which can be excited by the same sound in a flat country. Nor must I omit
                    a circumstance which here renders the close of Spring especially interesting; I
                    mean the practice of bringing down the Ewes from the Mountains, to yean in the
                    Vallies and enclosed grounds.—The springing herbage being thus cropped,
                    that first tender and emerald green of the season, which would otherwise last
                    little more than a fortnight, is prolonged in the pastures and meadows for many
                    weeks; while they are farther enlivened by the multitude of lambs bleating and
                    skipping about; which, as they gather strength, are turned out upon the open
                    mountains, and with their slender limbs, their snow white colour, and their wild
                    and light motions, beautifully accord or contrast with the lawns and rocks, upon
                    and among which they must now begin to seek their food. But, what is of most
                    consequence, the Traveller at this season would be almost sure of having fine
                    weather.—The opinion which I have given concerning the comparative
                    advantages of the different times for visiting these Lakes, is founded upon a
                    long acquaintance with the Country, and an intimate knowledge of its appearance
                    at all seasons. But, I am aware that few of those, who may be satisfied with the
                    reasons, by which this opinion is supported, will be able to profit from what
                    has been said; as the time and manner of an excursion of this kind are mostly
                    regulated by circumstances which prevent an entire freedom of choice. It will
                    therefore be more pleasant to me to observe that, though the months of July and
                    August are liable to the objections which have been mentioned, yet it not
                    unfrequently happens that the weather, at this time, is not more wet or stormy
                    than they, who are really capable of enjoying the sublime forms of Nature in
                    their height of sublimity, would desire. For no Traveller, provided he is in
                    good health and with any command of time, would have a just privilege to visit
                    such scenes, if he could grudge the price of a little confinement among them or
                    interruption in his journey from the sight or sound of a storm coming-on or
                    clearing-away; and he would congratulate himself upon the bold bursts of
                    sunshine, the descending vapours, and wandering lights and shadows, the
                    invigorated torrents and water-falls, with which broken weather, in a
                    mountainous region, is accompanied.—At such a time the monotony of
                    midsummer colouring, and the want of variety caused by this, and by the glaring
                    atmosphere of long, cloudless and hot days, is wholly removed.</p>

               <p>It is obvious that the point, from which a Stranger should begin this Tour, and
                    the order in which it will be convenient to him to see the different Vales will
                    depend upon this circumstance; viz: from what quarter of the Island he comes. If
                    from Scotland, or by the way of Stainmoor, it will suit him to start from
                    Penrith, taking the scenery of Lowther in his way to Hawes-water. He will next
                    visit Ullswater, &amp;c. reversing the order which I shall point out as being in
                    itself the best. Mr. West has judiciously directed those to whom it is
                    convenient to proceed from Lancaster over the sands to take Furness Abbey in
                    their way, if so inclined; and then to advance by the Lake of Coniston. This is
                    unquestionably the most favourable approach. The beautiful Lake of Coniston will
                    thus be traced upwards from its outlet, the only way in which it can be seen,
                    for the first time, without an entire yielding up of its most delightful
                    appearances. And further, the Stranger, from the moment he sets his foot upon
                    the Sands, seems to leave the turmoil and the traffic of the world behind him;
                    and crossing the majestic Plain from which the Sea has retired, he beholds,
                    rising apparently from its base, that cluster of Mountains, among the recesses
                    of which he is going to wander, and into which, by the Vale of Coniston, he is
                    gradually and peacefully introduced. The Lake and Vale of Coniston, approached
                    in this manner, improve in appearance with every step. And I may here make this
                    general remark, which, indeed the Reader may have deduced from the
                    representation of the Country, given in the Introduction, that, wherever it is
                    possible, these Lakes and Vallies should be approached from the foot; otherwise
                    most things will come upon the Spectator to great disadvantage. This general
                    rule applies, though not with equal force to all the Lakes, with the single
                    exception of Lowes-water, which, lying in a direction opposite to the rest, has
                    its most favourable aspects determined accordingly.</p>
               <p>At the head of Coniston close to the water side is a small and comfortable Inn,
                    which I would advise the Traveller, who is not part of a large company, and who
                    does not look for a parade of accommodation, to make his head-quarters for two
                    days. The first of these days, if the weather permit, may be agreeably passed in
                    an excursion to the Vale of Duddon, or Donnerdale, as part of it is called, and
                    which name may with propriety be given to the whole. It lies over the high hill
                    which bounds the Vale of Coniston on the West. This Valley is very rarely
                    visited; but I recommend it with confidence to the notice of the Traveller of
                    taste and feeling. It will be best approached by a road, ascending from near the
                    church of Coniston, which leads to that part of Donnerdale called Seathwaite.
                    The road is so long and steep that the Traveller will be obliged to lead his
                    horse a considerable part of it. The ascent and descent cannot I think be less
                    than five miles; but, nothing can be found more beautiful than the scene, into
                    which he will be received at the bottom of the hill on the other side. This
                    little circular Valley is a collateral compartment of the long winding Vale,
                    through which flows the stream of Duddon; and its Brook finds its way to the
                    River. Advancing, you will come to the lowly Chapel of Seathwaite, and a field
                    or two beyond, is a Farm-house, where, though there be no sign-board, or outward
                    mark of an Inn, the Traveller who can content himself with homely diet may be
                    accommodated.—Having satisfied himself with strolling about Seathwaite, he
                    will proceed down Donnerdale to Ulpha Kirk; and from this Church-yard he will
                    have as grand a combination of mountain lines and forms as perhaps this country
                    furnishes. The whole scene is inspirited by the sound and sight of the River
                    rolling immediately below the steep ground upon the top of which the Church
                    stands. From Ulpha Kirk proceed down the Vale towards Broughton. The same
                    character of mingled wildness and cultivation is still preserved. Rocky grounds,
                    which must for ever forbid the entrance of the plough, here and there, interrupt
                    the cultivation; and in part or wholly fill up the bottom or sides of the
                    Vale.—This beautiful Vale does not gradually disappear in a flat Plain,
                    but terminates abruptly in a prospect of the Sands of Duddon, and of the Irish
                    Sea. These are seen in conjunction with its River, and deep recesses of wood. On
                    this account, and for the sake of descending upon Seathwaite so advantageously,
                    I have <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/38_0.jpg">[p. 38]</ref> recommended in opposition to the general rule, that it should
                    be approached from the upper part, rather than from its outlet. From Broughton
                    return to Coniston by the nearest road. The morning of the next day may be
                    employed in sailing upon, and looking about the higher part of the Lake, and in
                    strolling upon its Banks; and the other half in an excursion to the Valley of
                    Yewdale (a branch of the Vale of Coniston) and round the sequestered Valley of
                    Tilberthwaite, which may be considered as a remoter apartment of the Valley of
                    Yewdale. This excursion may be about five miles, and may be taken either on foot
                    or horse-back; but not in a carriage. From the Valley of Yewdale having mounted
                    to that of Tilberthwaite, with the Brook upon the right hand, pursue the road
                    till it leads to the furthest of two Cottages; there, ask the way through the
                    fields to an house called Holm-ground. If, on horse-back, alight there; and from
                    a rocky and woody hill, behind the house you will look down upon this wild,
                    beautiful, and singularly secluded Valley. From Holm-ground return to the Inn at
                    Coniston. Next day proceed to Hawkshead; and thence by the side of Estwaite
                    looking back a little while after the road has left the Lake side upon a fine
                    view (which will be found among these Etchings) of the Lake of Estwaite. Thence,
                    through the two Villages of Sawrey, you come to the Ferry-house upon Windermere
                    where are good accommodations for the night.</p>
               <p>The Tourist has now reached Windermere, and has been introduced in his road to
                    some sequestered spots not exemplified in these Etchings, but, which, if he
                    wishes to have a complete knowledge of the various features of this Country, he
                    will be glad to have visited. Every thing that is of consequence has been taken
                    in its best order, except that the first burst of the Vale of Windermere, though
                    very interesting from this approach, is much inferior to that which would have
                    come upon him had he descended by the road from Kendal. Before the Traveller,
                    whom I have thus far accompanied, enters the Peninsula, at the extremity of
                    which the Ferry House stands, it will be adviseable to ascend to a
                    Pleasure-house belonging to J.C. Curwen, Esq. which he will see upon the side of
                    the rocks on his left hand.—There is a gate, and a person, attending at a
                    little Lodge, or Cot adjoining, who will conduct him. From this point he will
                    look down upon the cluster of Islands in the central part of the Lake, upon
                    Bowness, Rayrigg, and the Mountains of Troutbeck; and will have a prospect of
                    the lower division of this expanse of water to its extremity. The upper part is
                    hidden. The Pleasure house is happily situated, and is well in its kind, but,
                    without intending any harsh reflections on the contriver, from whom it was
                    purchased by its present Proprietor, it may be said that he, who remembers the
                    spot on which this building stands, and the immediate surrounding grounds as
                    they were less than thirty years ago, will sigh for the coming of that day when
                    Art, through every rank of society, shall be taught to have more reverence for
                    Nature. This scene is, in its natural constitution, far too beautiful to require
                    any exotic or obtrusive embellishments, either of planting or architecture. With
                    Winandermere a large majority of Visitants begin this Tour. The ordinary course
                    is from Kendal, by the nearest road to Bowness; but I would recommend it to all
                    persons, whatever may be their mode of conveyance, or however large their party,
                    when they shall have reached the Turnpike-house, about a mile beyond Kendal, not
                    to take, as is commonly done, the road which leads directly to Bowness; but that
                    through Stavely; inasmuch as the break of prospect from Orrest-head, where the
                    road brings you to the first sight of Windermere, in itself one of the finest
                    things in the Tour, is much grander than as it appears from the other road. This
                    for two reasons; first, that you are between two and three miles nearer the
                    sublime mountains and large expanse of water at the head of the Lake; and
                    secondly that the new houses and plantations, and the number of trim and
                    artificial objects with which the neighbourhood of Bowness is crouded, are so
                    far removed from this point, as not to be individually offensive, as they melt
                    into the general mass of the Landscape. At the bottom of the hill, you find a
                    Guide-post; and, turning, abruptly to the left, will immediately come in sight
                    of the same general prospect which has been seen above, from a point, which, as
                    it is comparatively low, necessarily changes the character of the scene. Thence
                    on, through the close woods of Rayrigg, to the bustling Inn of Bowness.</p>
               <p>I will not call upon the Reader to waste his time upon descriptions of things,
                    which every one makes a point of seeing, and of such as lie open to the notice
                    of the most inattentive Traveller. This, with respect to a country now so well
                    known, would be useless in itself; and would be especially improper in a
                    publication of this kind, the main purport of which is, to exhibit scenes which
                    lie apart from the beaten course of observation.—Accordingly I shall
                    chiefly expatiate upon those retired spots, which have furnished subjects for
                    the majority of these Etchings, or upon others of the same character; and when I
                    treat of the more frequent scenes, I shall attempt little more than to point out
                        <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/39_0.jpg">[p. 39]</ref> qualities by which they are characterized, which may easily
                    escape the notice of the cursory Spectator. The appearance of the neighbourhood
                    of Bowness, within the last five and thirty years, has undergone many changes,
                    and most of these for the worse, for want of due attention to those principles
                    of taste, and those rules for planting and building in a country of this kind,
                    which have been discussed at large in the Introduction. The Islands of
                    Windermere are beautifully shaped and intermingled. Upon the largest are a few
                    fine old trees; but a great part of this delightful spot, when it first fell
                    into the Improver’s hand, was struck over with trees that are here out of place;
                    and, had the present public-spirited Proprietor sufficient leisure amidst his
                    important avocations to examine the principles which have been enforced in these
                    pages, he would probably be induced to weed these foreigners out by little and
                    little, and introduce more appropriate trees in their stead; such as would be
                    pleasing to look at in their youth, and in maturity and old age might succeed to
                    those venerable natives which the axe has spared. The embankment also, which has
                    been raised round this Island for the sake of preserving the land, could only,
                    it should seem, have been necessary in a few exposed points; and the artificial
                    appearance which this has given to the whole spot is much to be regretted; not
                    to speak of the infinite varieties of minute beauty which it must have
                    destroyed. Could not the margin of this noble Island be given back to Nature?
                    Winds and Waves work with a careless and graceful hand; and any thing which they
                    take away would be amply compensated by the additional spirit, dignity and
                    loveliness which these agents and the other powers of Nature would soon
                    communicate to what was left behind.</p>
               <p>Windermere ought to be seen both from its shores and from its surface. None of
                    the other Lakes unfold so many fresh beauties to him who sails upon them. This
                    is owing to its greater size, to its Islands, and to a circumstance in which
                    this Lake differs from all the rest, viz. that of having two Vales at its head,
                    with their accompanying mountains of nearly equal dignity. Nor can the whole
                    grandeur of these two terminations be seen at the same time from any one point,
                    except from the bosom of the Lake. The Islands may be explored at any time of
                    the day; but one bright unruffled evening at least, must, if possible, be set
                    apart for the splendour, the stillness and solemnity of a three hours voyage
                    upon the higher division of the Lake, not omitting, towards the end of the
                    excursion, to quit the expanse of water, and peep into the close and calm River
                    at the head; which, in its quiet character, at such a time, appears rather like
                    an overflow of the peaceful Lake itself than to have any more immediate
                    connection with the rough mountains from which it has descended, or the
                    turbulent Torrents of which it is composed. Many persons content themselves with
                    what they see of Windermere in their progress in a boat from Bowness to the head
                    of the Lake, walking thence to Ambleside; but this is doing things by halves.
                    The whole road from Bowness is rich in diversity of pleasing or grand scenery;
                    there is scarcely a field on the road side which, if it were entered, would not
                    give to the Landscape some additional charm. Low-wood Inn, a mile from the head
                    of Windermere is a pleasant halting-place; and the fields above it, and the lane
                    which leads to the Troutbeck, present beautiful views towards each extremity of
                    the Lake. From this place, and still more conveniently from Ambleside, rides on
                    horse-back or in carriages may be taken in almost every direction, and the
                    interesting walks are inexhaustible.</p>

               <p>This Town or Market-village was formerly perhaps more rich in picturesque beauty,
                    arising from a combination of rustic architecture and natural scenery than any
                    small Town or Village in Great Britain. Many of the ancient buildings with their
                    porches, projections, round chimnies and galleries have been displaced to make
                    way for the docked, featureless, and memberless edifices of modern architecture;
                    which look as if fresh brought upon wheels from the Foundry, where they had been
                    cast. Yet this Town, if carefully noticed, will still be found to retain such
                    store of picturesque materials as will secure the praise of what it once was
                    from any suspicion of partiality. The Brook, which divides the Town ought to be
                    explored along its channel; if the state of the stream will permit. Below the
                    Bridge is a Mill, and also an old Summer-house, with other old buildings, ivied
                    Trunks of Trees, and mossy Stones, which have furnished subjects for many a
                    picture; and above the Bridge, though there are no Buildings, every step is
                    interesting till the curious Traveller is stopped by the huge breastwork of
                    Stock-gill Force. Within a quarter of a mile of Ambleside is a scene called the
                    Nook, which deserves to be explored. It is to be found in Scandle Gill, the
                    channel of the first Brook that comes down Scandle Fell to the North of
                    Ambleside. I need not describe the scene; its prin- <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/40_0.jpg">[p. 40]</ref> cipal feature is a Bridge thrown over the Torrent. From this
                    Bridge I wish it were in my power to recommend it to the Traveller to proceed
                    northwards, along the slope of the hill-side, till he reaches the Park of
                    Rydale; but this would be a trespass; for there is no path, and high and envious
                    stone walls interpose. We must therefore give up the best approach to some of
                    the most glorious scenes in the world; this may be yet said, though not without
                    painful regret for the havoc which has been made among them. Some hundreds of
                    oaks are gone, <quote>

                    of which penetrated like a vision, Landscapes of rivers, broad waters, vallies,
                    rocks and mountains:—The Lake of Rydale on the North-west, with its
                    Islands and rocky steeps, circular and deeply embosomed; and to the South the
                    long Valley of Ambleside and the gleaming Lake of Windermere. The noblest of
                    these trees have been sacrificed; but the side of the hill, though thinned, is
                    not wholly laid bare; and the Herons and Rooks that hover round this choice
                    retreat have yet a remnant of their ancient roosting-place. The unfrequented
                    spots, of which I have been speaking may be visited, with permission from the
                    Mansion, after the Water-fall has been seen.</p>
               <p>Of places at a distance from Ambleside, but commodiously visited from that
                    Village, Coniston may be first mentioned; though this Lake as I said before,
                    will thus be approached to great disadvantage.—Next comes Great Langdale,
                    a Vale which should on no account be missed by him who has a true enjoyment of
                    grand separate Forms composing a sublime Unity, austere but reconciled and
                    rendered attractive to the affections by the deep serenity that is spread over
                    every thing. There is no good carriage road through this Vale; nor ought that to
                    be regretted; for it would impair its solemnity; but the road is tolerable for
                    about the distance of three miles from Ambleside, namely along the Vale of
                    Brathay, and above the western banks of Loughrigg Tarn, and still further, to
                    the entrance of Langdale itself; but the small and peaceful Valley of Loughrigg
                    is seen to much greater advantage from the eastern side. When therefore you have
                    quitted the River Brathay enquire at the first house for the foot road, which
                    will conduct you round the lower extremity of the Tarn, and so on to its head,
                    where, at a little distance from the Tarn the path again leads to the publick
                    road and about a mile further conducts you to Langdale Chapel.—A little
                    way beyond this sequestered and simple place of worship is a narrow passage on
                    the right leading into a slate-quarry which has been finely excavated. Pursuing
                    this road a few hundred yards further, you come in view of the noblest reach of
                    this Vale, which I shall not attempt to describe. Under the Precipice adjoining
                    to the Pikes lies invisibly Stickle Tarn, and thence descends a conspicuous
                    Torrent down the breast of the Mountain. Near this Torrent is Dungeon Gill
                    Force, which cannot be found without a Guide, who may be taken up at one of the
                    Cottages at the foot of the Mountain. <quote>

                  </quote> At the head of Langdale is a passage over to the Borrowdale;
                    but this ought on no account to be taken by a person who has not seen the main
                    features of the country from their best approaches.—If the Traveller has
                    been zealous enough to advance as far as Dungeon-gill Force, let him enquire for
                    Blea Tarn; he may return by that circuit to Ambleside. Blea Tarn is not an
                    object of any beauty in itself, but it is situated in a small, deep circular
                    Valley of peculiar character; for it contains only one Dwelling-house and two or
                    three cultivated fields. Passing down this Valley fail not to look back now and
                    then, and you will see Langdale Pikes, from behind the rocky steeps that form
                    its north-eastern boundary, lifting themselves, as if on tip-toe, to pry into
                    it. Quitting the Valley you will descend into little Langdale, and thence may
                    proceed by Colwith Force and Bridge. Leaving Skelwith-Bridge on your left ascend
                    with the road to Skelwith; and from a field on the northern side of that small
                    cluster of houses, you will look down upon a grand view of the River Brathay,
                    Elter-water and the mountains of Langdale, &amp;c. Thence proceed occasionally
                    looking, down the Brathay on the side of the River opposite to that by which you
                    had ascended in your way to Louthrigg Tarn. The whole of this excursion may be
                    as much as 18 miles, and would require a <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/41_0.jpg">[p. 41]</ref> long morning to be devoted to the accomplishment. I will now
                    mention only one more ride or walk from Ambleside. Go to the Bridge over the
                    Rothay (of which a view is given in the Etchings), between Ambleside and
                    Clappersgate. When you have crossed the Bridge, turn to a Gate on the right
                    hand, and proceed with the road up the Valley of Ambleside, till you come
                    opposite to the Village of Rydale; do not cross over to Rydale, but keep close
                    to the Mountain on your left hand, with the River at a little distance on your
                    right, till you come in view of Rydale Lake. Advance with the Lake on your right
                    till you quit the Vale of Rydale, and come in view of Grasmere. Follow the road,
                    which will conduct you round along the lower extremity of the Lake of Grasmere,
                    till you reach the Church; thence into the main road back to Ambleside, looking
                    behind you frequently.</p>
               <p>The two hours before sun-set are the most favourable time of the day for seeing
                    the lower division of Wytheburne Lake, but it is advisable to choose the earlier
                    part of this time, in order that the Traveller may be enabled to descend into
                    the Vale of Keswick while the sun-beams are upon it. That this first impression
                    of that Vale should be received under the most favourable circumstances, is very
                    desirable; and therefore I do not recommend, as I should otherwise have done,
                    that the Traveller, who has been guided by my directions thus far, should
                    lengthen his journey to Keswick still further, and follow the stream that issues
                    out of Wytheburn Lake till it enters St. John’s Vale, which he may do if he be
                    on foot, keeping to the side of it almost all the way; and, if on horseback, he
                    may return to it by a small circuit, after having crossed Shoulthwaite Moss. I
                    should have directed the Traveller in this case to proceed a mile and a half
                    down St. John’s Vale, and then to cross Naddle Fell, by St. John’s Chapel, which
                    would bring him into the road between Ambleside and Keswick, something better
                    than two miles short of the latter place. This may easily be done, taking the
                    lower division of Wytheburn earlier in the afternoon than the time which I have
                    recommended as the best.</p>
               <p>We have now reached Keswick. I shall not attempt a general description of this
                    celebrated Vale, because this has already been admirably performed by Dr. Brown,
                    and by the Poet Gray; and the place is at this time very generally known. As the
                    Views in this work have been taken almost exclusively from retired spots in
                        the <emph>Ghylls</emph>, or Gills, and smaller Vallies that branch off from
                    the trunk of the Vale, it will be more appropriate to this publication, and will
                    better suit its narrow limits, to say a few words upon them. And to begin with
                    one of the smallest, Applethwaite (for Views of which see <hi rendition="#smallcaps">Nos</hi>. 22, 23, and 24). This is a hamlet of six or
                    seven houses, hidden in a small recess at the foot of Skiddaw, and adorned by a
                    little Brook, which, having descended from a great height in a silver line down
                    the steep blue side of the Mountain, trickles past the doors of the Cottages.
                    This concealed spot is very interesting as you approach from the bottom, with
                    your face towards the green and blue mass of Skiddaw; and is not less pleasing
                    when, having advanced by a gentle slope for some space, you turn your head and
                    look out from this chink or fissure, which is sprinkled with little orchards and
                    trees, and behold the whole splendour of the upper and middle part of the Vale
                    of Keswick, with its Lakes and Mountains spread before your eyes. A small
                    Spinning-mill has lately been erected here, and some of the old Cottages, with
                    their picturesque appendages, are fallen into decay. This is to be regretted;
                    for, these blemishes excepted, the scene is a rare and almost singular
                    combination of minute and sequestered beauty, with splendid and extensive
                    prospects. On the opposite side of the Vale of Keswick lie the Valley of
                    Newlands, and the Village of Braithwaite, with its stream descending from a cove
                    of the Mountain. From both these spots I have given Views, from which an idea of
                    their features may be collected. Braithwaite lies at the foot of Whenlater, in
                    the road to Lorton and Cockermouth; and through Newlands passes the nearest road
                    to Buttermere. Returning to the eastern side of the Vale of Keswick, we find the
                    narrow and retired Valley of Watenlath, enclosed on each side and at the head by
                    craggy Mountains. In the Mountains at the head, the stream rises, which forms
                    the Cascade of Lodore. This, after flowing a short way through a pastoral tract,
                    falls into a small Lake or Tarn, which lies midway in the long Valley of
                    Watenlath. At the point where the stream issues out of the Tarn, is a beautiful
                    Bridge of one arch, and close beside the Bridge is a little Hamlet, a cluster of
                    grey Cottages. There are no other dwellings in the Valley; and a more secluded
                    spot than this Hamlet cannot well be conceived; yet ascend a very little up the
                    hill above it, and you have a most magnificent prospect of the Vale of Keswick,
                    as far as Skiddaw; and, pursuing the Valley of Watenlath to its head, if you
                    look back, the view of the little Valley itself, with its Lake, Bridge, and
                    Cottages, is combined with that of the majestic Vale beyond, so that each seems
                    to be a part of the other. But the most considerable of the Dales which
                    communicate with the Vale of Keswick by the Rivers which flow through them, are
                    Borrowdale and St. John’s. Of St. John’s we have already spoken; and Borrowdale
                    is in fact the head of the Vale of Keswick. It would be an <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/42_0.jpg">[p. 42]</ref> endless task to attempt, by verbal descriptions, to guide the
                    traveller among the infinite variety of beautiful or interesting objects which
                    are found in the different reaches of the broad Valley itself, nor less so to
                    attempt to lead him through its little recesses, its nooks, and tributary glens.
                    I must content myself with saying, that this Valley surpasses all the others in
                    variety. Rocks and Woods are intermingled on the hill-sides with profuse
                    wildness; and on the plain below (for the area of the Valley, through all its
                    windings is generally a level plain, out of which the Mountains rise as from
                    their base,) the single Cottages and clusters of Houses are numerous; not
                    glaringly spread before the eye, but unobtrusive as the rocks themselves, and
                    mostly coloured like them. There is scarcely a Cottage that has not its own tuft
                    of trees. The Yew-tree has been a favourite with the former Inhabitants of
                    Borrowdale; for many fine old Yew-trees yet remain near the Cottages, probably
                    first planted for an ornament to their gardens, and now preserved as a shelter,
                    and for the sake of their venerable appearance. But the noblest Yew-trees to be
                    found here, are a cluster of three, with a fourth a little detached, which do
                    not stand in connection with any houses; they are in that part of Borrowdale
                    which is called Seathwaite, immediately under the entrance into the Lead-mines.
                    Nothing of the kind can be conceived more solemn and impressive than the small
                    gloomy grove formed by these trees.</p>
               <p>The lower part of the Vale of Keswick is occupied by the Lake of Bassenthwaite;
                    and he who coasts its western shore, will be well and variously recompensed; and
                    in particular by the appearance of Skiddaw, rising immediately from the opposite
                    side of the Lake. Following this road, we cross the lower extremity of Embleton
                    Vale. Embleton may be mentioned as the last of the Vallies collateral to the
                    main Vale of Keswick. It unfolds on the west, near the foot of Bassenthwaite
                    Lake, a scene of humble and gentle character; but deriving animated beauty from
                    the Lake, and striking majesty from the Mountain of Skiddaw, which is on this
                    side broken and rugged, and of an aspect which is forcibly contrasted with that
                    with which it looks upon Derwent Lake. The view of the whole vista of the Vale
                    of Keswick from Armathwaite and Ouze Bridge is magnificent; and the scenes upon
                    the River Derwent, as far as the grand ruins of Cockermouth Castle, are soft and
                    varied, and well worthy of the notice of the Pedestrian, who has leisure to go
                    in search of them.</p>
               <p>From the Vale of Keswick, of which there is no need to say any thing more, the
                    Tourist usually proceeds to Buttermere, to which there are three roads; the one
                    through part of Borrowdale, which brings him down into the Vale of Buttermere,
                    at its head; but Borrowdale I suppose to have been already explored, a strong
                    reason against choosing this approach. Yet in justice to this road I must add,
                    that the descent into Gatesgarth, immediately under Honister Crag, causes one of
                    the sublimest impressions which this country can produce. The second road leads
                    through Newlands. The descent into Buttermere by this way is solitary and grand;
                    but the Vale of Newlands itself I suppose also to have been visited in the Tour
                    round the Lake of Keswick (which no person of taste ought to omit), or in other
                    rambles. It follows, then, that the third is the road which I would recommend,
                    namely, the carriage road, which leads over Whinlater, through part of the Vale
                    of Lorton, to the outlet of Crummock-water. Here was formerly an inn, kept at a
                    house called Scale Hill, an accommodation which I believe no longer exists. It
                    would, however, be ill-judged not to turn aside to Scale Hill; the carriage or
                    horses might be sent forward by the high-road, and ordered to wait till the
                    Traveller rejoined them by the footpath, which leads through the woods along the
                    side of Crummock. This path presents noble scenes, looking up the Lake towards
                    Buttermere. If the Traveller be desirous of visiting Lowes-water, instead of
                    proceeding directly along this path, he must cross the Bridge over the Cocker,
                    near Scale Hill, to which he must return after a walk or ride of three or four
                    miles. I am not sure that the circuit of this Lake can be made on horseback; but
                    every path and field in the neighbourhood would well repay the active exertions
                    of the Pedestrian. Nor will the most hasty Visitant fail to notice with
                    pleasure, that community of attractive and substantial houses which are
                    dispersed over the fertile inclosures at the foot of those rugged Mountains, and
                    form a most impressive contrast with the humble and rude dwellings which are
                    usually found at the head of these far-winding Dales. It must be mentioned also,
                    that there is scarcely any thing finer than the view from a boat in the centre
                    of Crummock-water. The scene is deep, and solemn, and lonely; and in no other
                    spot is the majesty of the Mountains so irresistibly felt as an omnipresence, or
                    so passively submitted to as a spirit incumbent upon the imagination. Near the
                    head of Crummock-water, on the right, is Scale Force, a Waterfal worthy of being
                    visited, both for its own sake, and for the sublime View across the Lake,
                    looking back in your ascent towards the Chasm. The Fall is perpendicular from an
                    immense height, a slender stream faintly illuminating a gloomy fissure. This
                    spot is never seen to a more advantage than when it happens, that, while you are
                    looking up <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/43_1.jpg">[p. 43]</ref> through the Chasm towards the summit of the lofty Waterfal,
                    large fleecy clouds, of dazzling brightness, suddenly ascend into view, and
                    disappear silently upon the wind. The Village of Buttermere lies a mile and a
                    half higher up the Vale, and of the intermediate country I have nothing to say.
                    It would be advisable, if time permit, that you should go as far up the Vale as
                    Honister Crag; and if in horseback, or on foot, you may return to Keswick by
                    Newlands.</p>
               <p>The rest of the scenes in this part of the country of which I have given views,
                    namely, those of Ennerdale and Westdale, cannot, without a good deal of trouble,
                    be approached in a carriage. For Foot-travellers, and for those who are not
                    afraid of leading their horses through difficult ways, there is a road from
                    Buttermere directly over the mountains to Ennerdale; there is also another road
                    from the head of Buttermere to the head of Westdale, without going into
                    Borrowdale; but both Ennerdale and Westdale are <emph>best</emph> seen by making
                    a considerable circuit; namely, by retracing our steps to Scale Hill, and thence
                    by Lowes-water and Lamplugh to Ennerdale. The first burst of Ennerdale from an
                    eminence is very noble, and the mind is more alive to the impression, because we
                    have quitted for a while the heart of the mountains, and been led through a
                    tamer country. Ennerdale is bold and savage in its general aspect, though not
                    destitute, towards the higher part of the Lake, of fertile and beautiful spots.
                    From Ennerdale-Bridge to Calder-Bridge, the road leads over Cold Fell. The
                    distance is six miles, a desolate tract, with the exception of the last half
                    mile, through a narrow and well-wooded Valley, in which is a small, but
                    beautiful fragment of Calder Abbey. The village lying close to Calder-Bridge has
                    good inns, and the bed of the River about the Bridge is rocky and spirited. We
                    are here in a plain country near to the sea, and therefore better prepared to
                    enjoy the mountain sublimities of Westdale, which soon begin to shew themselves,
                    and grow upon us at every step, till we reach the margin of the Lake. This Water
                    (for the Lakes are generally called <emph>Waters</emph> by the country people)
                    is not so much as four miles in length, and becomes very narrow for the space of
                    half a mile towards its outlet. On one side it is bordered by a continued
                    straight line of high and almost perpendicular steeps, rising immediately from
                    the Lake, without any bays or indentings. This is a very striking feature; for
                    these steeps, or <emph>screes</emph> (as places of this kind are named), are not
                    more distinguished by their height and extent, than by the beautiful colours
                    with which the pulverized rock, for ever crumbling down their sides, overspreads
                    them. The surface has the apparent softness of the dove’s neck, and (as was
                    before mentioned, in reference to spots of this kind,) resembles a dove’s neck
                    strongly in its hues, and in the manner in which they are intermingled. On the
                    other side, Wast-water is bordered by knotty and projecting rocky mountains,
                    which, retiring in one place, admit the interposition of a few green fields
                    between them and the Lake, with a solitary farmhouse. From the termination of
                    the Screes rises Scaw Fell, deemed higher than Skiddaw, or Helvellyn, or any of
                    the Mountains. The summit, as seen from Westdale, is bold and abrupt, and if you
                    should quit the Valley and ascend towards it, it appears, from the Cove beneath,
                    like the shattered walls or towers of an enormous edifice. Upon the summit of
                    one of those towers is a fragment of rock that looks like an eagle, or a large
                    owl, on that commanding eminence, stationary through all seasons. The Views
                    which I have given are from the shore about the middle of Wast-water, from a
                    point where the Vale appears to be terminated by three large conical Mountains,
                    Yewbarrow on the left, Great Gavel in the centre, and Lingmoor on the right.
                    About two miles further is the Division of West-dale Head, with its lowly
                    Chapel. This place formerly consisted of twenty tenements. It is now reduced to
                    six. This Valley has been described in the Introduction, as seen from the summit
                    of Great Gavel; but the Traveller will be pleased with a nearer view of these
                    pastoral dwellings, which in the inside are as comfortable as their outside is
                    beautiful and picturesque. A hospitable people live here, and do not repine at
                    the distance and the barriers which separate them from the noisy world. Give
                    them more sunshine and a richer soil, and they would have little to complain of.
                    The Stranger will observe here and elsewhere large heaps of stones, like
                    Sepulchral Barrows, which have been collected from the fields and thrown
                    together by the labours of many generations. From the summits either of Great
                    Gavel, or Scaw Fell, there are sublime prospects. Great Gavel may be proud of
                    the Vallies which it looks down into, and Scaw Fell of the dark multitudinous
                    Mountains, rising ridge above ridge, which it commands on the one side, and of
                    the extent of sea and sand spreading in a level plain on the other. The ascent
                    of Scaw Fell is easy, that of Great Gavel laborious. I cannot deny myself the
                    pleasure of adding, that on the highest point of Great Gavel is a small
                    triangular receptacle of water in a rock. It is not a spring; yet the shepherds
                    say that it is never dry: certainly when I was there, during a season of
                    drought, it was well supplied with water. Here the Traveller may slake his
                    thirst plenteously with a pure and celestial beverage; for it appears that this
                    cup or bason has no other <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/44_0.jpg">[p. 44]</ref> feeder than the dews of heaven, the showers, the vapours, the
                    hoar frost, and the spotless snow. From Wastdale return to Keswick by Stye-Head
                    and Borrowdale. Take a look backwards upon Wastdale, from the last point where
                    it is visible. The long strait vista of the Vale, and the sea beyond, apparent
                    between the Mountains, form a grand whole. A few steps further bring you to
                    Stye-Head Tarn (for which see No. 43). By the side of the Tarn, an eagle (I
                    believe of the ospray species) was killed last spring. Though large, it was very
                    light, and seemed exhausted by hunger. The stream which flows into this Tarn
                    comes from another, called Sprinkling Tarn, famous among anglers for the finest
                    trouts in the country. In rainy seasons there is a magnificent waterfal formed
                    by the stream which issues from Stye-Head Tarn. You have it on your left as you
                    descend into Seathwaite division of Rovendale. About a mile further down upon
                    the left is that cluster of yew-tress recommended to notice; thence through a
                    succession of magnificent scenes to Keswick.</p>
               <p>It remains that we should speak of Ullswater. There are two roads by which this
                    Lake may be visited from Keswick. That which is adapted for Travellers on
                    horseback, or on foot, crosses the lower part of St. John’s Vale, and brings you
                    down through the Valley and scattered Village of Matterdale into Gowbarrow Park,
                    unfolding at once a magnificent view of the two higher reaches of the Lake.
                    Airey Force thunders down the <emph>Ghyll</emph>, or Gill, on the left, at a
                    small distance from the road; but you are separated from it by the Park-wall. In
                    a carriage, Ullswater is best approached from Penrith. A mile and a half brings
                    you to the winding Vale of Emont, and the prospects increase in interest till
                    you reach Patterdale; but the first four miles along Ullswater by this road are
                    comparatively tame, and in order to see the lower part of the Lake to advantage,
                    it is absolutely necessary to go round by Poolly-Bridge, and to ride at least
                    three miles along the Westmoreland side of the Water, towards Martindale. The
                    Views from this quarter, especially if you ascend from the road into the fields,
                    are magnificent; yet I only mention this that the transient Traveller may know
                    what exists; for it will be very inconvenient for him to go in search of them.
                    The person who takes this course of three or four miles, which I am now
                    recommending, <emph>on foot</emph>, should take care to have a boat in readiness
                    at the end of his walk, to carry him right across to the Cumberland side, along
                    which he may pursue his way upwards to Patterdale.</p>
               <p>Having conducted the Traveller hither, I shall treat no further of the body of
                    this celebrated Vale; but, for the same reasons which governed me when I was
                    speaking of Keswick, I shall confine myself to the Glens and Vallies which
                    branch off from it.</p>
               <p>At Dalemain, about three miles from Penrith, a Stream is crossed, called Dacre,
                    which, rising in the moorish country about Penruddock, flows down a soft
                    sequestered Valley, passing by the ancient mansions of Hutton John and Dacre
                    Castle. The former is pleasantly situated, though of a character somewhat gloomy
                    and monastic; and from some of the fields near Dalemain, Dacre Castle, backed by
                    the jagged summit of Saddleback, and with the Valley and Stream in front of it,
                    forms a grand picture. There is no other stream that conducts us to any glen or
                    valley worthy of being mentioned, till you reach the one which leads you up to
                    Airey Force, and then into Matterdale, before spoken of. Matterdale, though a
                    wild and interesting spot, has no peculiar features that would make it worth the
                    Stranger’s while to go in search of them; but in Gowbarrow Park the lover of
                    Nature might wish to linger for hours. Here is a powerful Brook, which dashes
                    among rocks through a deep glen, hung on every side with a rich and happy
                    intermixture of native wood; here are beds of luxuriant fern, aged hawthorns,
                    and hollies decked with honeysuckles; and fallow-deer glancing and bounding over
                    the lawns and through the thickets. These are the attractions of the retired
                    views, or constitute a fore-ground to ever-varying pictures of the majestic
                    Lake, forced to take a winding course by bold promontories, and environed by
                    mountains of sublime form, towering above each other. Having passed under a
                    plantation of larches, we reach, at the outlet of Gowbarrow Park, a third
                    Stream, which flows through a little recess called Glencoin, in which lurks a
                    single house, yet visible from the road. Let the Artist and leisurely Traveller
                    turn aside to it for the buildings, and the objects around them are both
                    romantic and exquisitely picturesque. Having passed under the steeps of
                    Styebarrow Crag, and the remains of its native woods, you cross, at
                    Glenridding-Bridge, a fourth Stream, which, if followed up, would lead to Red
                    Tarn and the recesses of Helvellyn. The opening on the side of Ullswater Vale,
                    down which the Stream flows, is adorned with fertile fields, cottages, and
                    natural groves, which agreeably coalesce with the transverse views of the Lake;
                    and the Stream, if followed up after the enclosures are left behind, will lead
                    along bold water-breaks and waterfals to a silent Tarn in the recesses of
                    Helvellyn. This desolate spot was formerly haunted by eagles, that built in the
                    precipice which forms its western barrier. These birds used to wheel and hover
                    round the head of the solitary angler. It also now derives a melancholy interest
                    from the <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/45_0.jpg">[p. 45]</ref> fate of a young man, a stranger, who perished here a few
                    years ago, by falling down the rocks in his attempt to cross over to Grasmere.
                    His remains were discovered by means of a faithful dog, which had lingered here
                    for the space of three months, self supported, and probably retaining to the
                    last an attachment to the skeleton of its dead master. But to return to the road
                    which we have left in the main Vale of Ullswater.—At the head of the Lake
                    (being now in Patterdale) we cross a fifth Stream, Grisdale Beck; this conducts
                    through a woody steep, where may be seen some unusually large ancient hollies,
                    up to the level area of the Valley of Grisdale; hence there is a path for
                    Foot-travellers, and along which a horse may be led, but not without difficulty,
                    to Grasmere. I know not any where a more sublime combination of mountain forms
                    than those which appear in front, as we ascend along the bed of this Valley; and
                    the impression increases with every step till the path grows steep; and as we
                    climb almost immediately under the projecting masses of Helvellyn, the mind is
                    overcome with a sensation, which in some would amount to personal fear, and
                    cannot but be awful even to those who are most familiar with the images of
                    duration, and power, and other kindred influences, by which mountainous
                    countries controul or exalt the imaginations of men. It is not uninteresting to
                    know, that in the last house but one of this Valley, separated, as it might
                    seem, from all the ambition and troubles of the world, from its wars and
                    commotions, was born the youth, who, in Spain, took prisoner the Colonel of the
                    Imperial Guard of Buonaparte. This favourite of the tyrant fled from the assault
                    of our British mountaineer with his two attendants, who escaped; but he himself
                    was not so fortunate. Having retraced the banks of this stream to Patterdale,
                    and pursued our way up the main Dale, the next considerable stream which we
                    cross, would, if ascended in the same manner, conduct us into Deepdale, the
                    character of which Valley may be conjectured by its name. It is terminated by a
                    cove, a craggy and gloomy abyss, with precipitous sides; a faithful receptacle
                    of the snows, which are carried into it, by the west wind, from the summit of
                    Fairfield. Lastly, having gone along the western side of Brothers-water and
                    passed Hartsop Hall, we are brought soon after to a stream which issues from a
                    cove richly decorated with native wood. This spot is, I believe, never explored
                    by Travellers; but whether from these sylvan and rocky recesses you look back on
                    the gleaming surface of Brothers-water, or forward to the precipitous sides and
                    lofty ridges of the mountains, you will be equally pleased with the beauty, the
                    grandeur, and the wildness of the scenery.</p>
               <p>We have thus noticed no less than seven Glens, or Vallies, which branch off from
                    the western side of the long Vale which we have been ascending. The opposite
                    side has only two streams of any importance, one of which flows by the Village
                    of Hartsop, near the foot of Brothers-water, and the other, coming down
                    Martindale, enters Ullswater at Sandwyke, opposite to Gowbarrow Park. Of
                    Martindale I shall say a few words, but I must first return to our head-quarters
                    at the Village of Patterdale. No persons, but such as come to this place merely
                    to pass through it, should fail to walk a mile and a half down the side of the
                    Lake opposite to that on which the high-road lies; they should proceed beyond
                    the point where the inclosures terminate. I have already had too frequent reason
                    to lament the changes which have been made in the face of this country; and
                    scarcely any where has a more grievous loss been sustained than upon the Farm of
                    Blowick, the only enclosed land which on this side borders the higher part of
                    the Lake. The axe has indiscriminately levelled a rich wood of birches and oaks,
                    which, two or three years ago, varied this favoured spot into a thousand
                    pictures. It has yet its land-locked bays and promontories; but now those
                    beautiful woods are gone, which clothed its lawns and <emph>perfected</emph> its
                    seclusion. Who, then, will not regret that those scenes, which might formerly
                    have been compared to an inexhaustible volume, are now spread before the eye in
                    a single sheet, magnificent indeed, but seemingly perused in a moment? From
                    Blowick, a narrow tract, by which a horse may be led, but with difficulty,
                    conducts along the cragged side of Place Fell, richly adorned with juniper, and
                    sprinkled over with birches, to the Village of Sandwyke; a few straggling
                    houses, which, with the small estates attached to them, occupy an opening
                    opposite to Lyulph’s Tower and Gowbarrow Park. This stream flows down
                    Martindale, a Valley deficient in richness, but interesting from its seclusion.
                    In Vales of this character the general want of wood gives a peculiar interest to
                    the scattered cottages, embowered in sycamores; and few of the Mountain Chapels
                    are more striking than this of Martindale, standing as it does in the centre of
                    the Valley, with one dark yew-tree, and enclosed by “a bare ring of mossy wall.”
                    The name of Boardale, a bare, deep, and houseless Valley, which communicates
                    with Martindale, shews that the wild swine were once numerous in that nook; and
                    Martindale Forest is yet one of the few spots in England ranged over by red
                    deer. These are the descendants of the aboriginal herds. In Martindale, the road
                    loses sight of the Lake, and leads over a steep hill, <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/image_galleries/46_0.jpg">[p. 46]</ref> bringing you again into view of Ullswater. Its lowest reach,
                    four miles in length, is before you; and the View is terminated by the long
                    ridge of Cross Fell at a distance. Immediately under the eye is a deep-indented
                    bay, with a plot of fertile land by the side of it, traversed by a small brook,
                    and rendered cheerful by two or three substantial houses of a more ornamental
                    and shewy appearance than is usual in these wild spots. Poolly-Bridge, at the
                    foot of the Lake, to which we have again returned, has a good inn; and from this
                    place Hawes-water, which has furnished me with the subject of an Etching, may be
                    conveniently visited. Of Hawes-water I shall only say, that it is a lesser
                    Ullswater, with this advantage, that it remains undefiled by the intrusion of
                    bad taste.</p>
               <p>Lowther Castle is about four miles from Poolly-Bridge, and if during this Tour
                    the Stranger has complained, as he will have reason to do, of a want of majestic
                    trees, he may be abundantly recompensed for his loss in the far-spreading woods
                    which surround that mansion.</p>
               <p>I must now express my hope, that the Reader of the foregoing pages will not blame
                    me for having led him through unfrequented paths so much out of the common road.
                    In this I have acted in conformity to the spirit of the Etchings, which are
                    chiefly taken from sequestered scenes; and these must become every day more
                    attractive in the eyes of the man of taste, unless juster notions and more
                    appropriate feelings should find their way into the minds of those who, either
                    from vanity, want of judgment, or some other cause, are rapidly taking away the
                    native beauties of such parts of this Country as are most frequented, or most
                    easy of access; and who are disguising the Vales, and the Borders of the Lakes,
                    by an accumulation of unsightly buildings and discordant objects.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This appendix assembles illustrative passages from letters directly related to 
                the composition, reception, and revision of Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title>. 
                The selections appear chronologically and are grouped into five key phases in the <title level="m">Guide</title>’s history: <ref target="#first">1807–1811</ref> (its origination 
                and initial publication in Wilkinson’s <title level="m">Select Views</title>); 
                <ref target="#second">1820</ref> (its first appearance under Wordsworth’s 
                name in <title level="m">The River Duddon</title>); <ref target="#third">1821–1834</ref> (the 
                text’s evolution into an independent guidebook in the third and fourth editions); 
                <ref target="#fourth">1835–1841</ref> (Wordsworth’s final revisions and the reception 
                of the fifth edition); and <ref target="#fifth">1842–1850</ref> (its reissue in 
                Hudson’s <title level="m">Complete Guide</title> 
                and absorption by the early-Victorian travel book industry).</p>
               <p rend="noCount">These excerpts derive from a number of sources, including original letters held at 
                various repositories. Unless otherwise indicated in the footnotes, reliable and complete transcriptions 
                of those letters by the Wordsworths may be found in <title level="m">The Letters of William and Dorothy 
                    Wordsworth</title>, 2nd ed., 8 vols. Oxford UP, 1967–93. Throughout our selections, we regularize 
                punctuation, expand abbreviations, and offer slight emendations for the sake of clarity.</p>

                  <head>2. <emph>William Wordsworth (WW) to the Reverend J. Pering, 
                    2 October 1808</emph>
                  </head>
                  <note place="inline" resp="editors">John Pering, vicar of Skipton and Kildwick in North 
                        Yorkshire, toured the Lakes in the summer of 1808 and enjoyed meeting William and Dorothy Wordsworth. 
                        Hoping to enhance his travel journal, he later requested a written description of the local 
                        mountains from the poet. In this friendly reply, Wordsworth offered several reasons for 
                        respectfully declining the request. A copy of Wordsworth’s letter survives in Pering’s manuscript 
                        notebook.</note>
                  <p rend="noCount">I am pleased to find that this beautiful country has made such an impression upon 
                        you as to induce you to record your feelings: but what shall I say to your request that I should 
                        communicate to you some description of the same objects?—Alas! you have but a faint notion how 
                        disagreeable writing, of all Sorts, is to me, except from the impulse of the moment.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">I must be my own Task master or I can do nothing at all. Last autumn I made a little 
                        Tour, with my wife, and she was very anxious that I should preserve the memory of it by a written 
                        account. I tried to comply with her entreaty, but an insuperable dullness came over me, and I could 
                        make no progress.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">This simple and true statement I am sure you will deem a sufficient apology for not 
                        venturing upon a theme so boundless as this sublime and beautiful region.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">Besides, you can easily conceive that objects may be too familiar to a Man, to leave 
                        him the power of describing them. This is the case with me in regard to these Lakes and mountains, 
                        which are my native Country, and among which I have passed the greatest part of my life: and 
                        really I should be utterly at a loss were I about to set myself to a formal delineation of them, 
                        or of any part of them, where to begin, and where to end.</p>

                  </head>
                  <note place="inline" resp="editors">The only surviving document detailing the negotiations surrounding 
                        the <title level="m">Select Views</title> letterpress, this letter was posted by Wilkinson from his 
                        home in Norfolk to Grasmere, where Coleridge was residing with the Wordsworths. Presumably 
                        overwhelmed with his new periodical, <title level="m">The Friend</title>, Coleridge had 
                        apparently suggested Wordsworth as a potential collaborator for Wilkinson. This letter includes 
                        Wilkinson’s response to Wordsworth’s concerns over <title level="m">Select Views</title> competing 
                        with a similar series by the poet’s artist friend William Green of Ambleside (1725–1811, 
                        <title level="m">DNB</title>). On its dating, see note 26 <!--[link]--> in the introduction to

                        tell our friend Wordsworth—that no two works, descriptive of the same country can be more 
                        different, or less likely to interfere with each other, than his and mine. But I shall write 
                        to Mr. Wordsworth in a few days more fully upon the subject when I hope either Mr.  W.—or 
                        yourself, or both, will afford me the assistance I shall explain, to enable me to make my work 
                        more perfect and acceptable to the public than it otherwise would be.</p>

                  <head>4. <emph>DW to Catherine Clarkson, 18 November 1809</emph>
                  </head>
                  <note place="inline" resp="editors">Catherine Clarkson, wife of the prominent abolitionist 
                        Thomas Clarkson (1760–1846, <title level="m">DNB</title>), was one of Dorothy’s closest 
                        friends. The Clarksons lived in the Lake District from 1796 to 1806, during which time 
                        they became intimates of the Wordsworths, but now they had moved back to the south of 
                        England. Dorothy here praises William’s introduction to <title level="m">Select Views</title> 
                        and reports that he is considering publishing his own guidebook apart from Wilkinson, 
                        predicting that a guidebook will prove more lucrative than her brother’s poetry. The letter 
                        reveals various details about the textual history of <title level="m">Select Views</title>, 
                        including that Sara Hutchinson sometimes acted as scribe for the project and that Wordsworth 
                        was awaiting proofs of Wilkinson’s prints before setting out on the “descriptions” part of 
                        his assignment.</note>
                  <p rend="noCount">Sara has been kept almost constantly busy in transcribing: for William, 
                        and for ‘The Friend’; therefore she has desired me to write to you. For William she has 
                        been transcribing the introduction to a collection of prints to be published by Mr. 
                        Wilkinson of Thetford (of which I believe you know the history as your husband’s name is 
                        down among those of the subscribers). I hope you will be interested with William’s part 
                        of the work (he has only finished the general introduction, being unable to do the rest 
                        till he has seen the prints). It is the only regular and I may say <emph>scientific</emph> 
                        account of the present and past state and appearance of the country that has yet appeared. 
                        I think, if he were to write a Guide to the Lakes and prefix this preface, it would sell 
                        better, and bring him more money than any of his higher labours. He has some thoughts of 
                        doing this; but do not mention it, as Mr. W[ilkinson]’s work should have its fair run. He 
                        mentioned to Mr. Wilkinson his scheme, to which I should think that Mr. W. will have no 
                        objection; as the Guide will, by calling Mr. W.’s publication to mind, after its first 
                        run, perhaps help to keep up the sale.</p>

                  <note place="inline" resp="editors">These two businesslike scribbles appear on undated <title level="m">Select Views</title> manuscript material sent by Wordsworth to Wilkinson. The first, 
                        inserted in Wordsworth’s hand at the top of a sheet transcribed by Sara Hutchinson, illuminates 
                        the collaborative process of <title level="m">Select Views</title>, showing all parties 
                        scrambling to keep up with the serial publication schedule. The second, a postscript, implies 
                        that Wilkinson’s art had impressed at least some in the extended Wordsworth family. 
                        Wordsworth’s notes have been conjecturally dated March 1810 by earlier editors, but our 
                        research suggests he wrote them later (see note 46 <!--[link]--> in our Introduction).</note>

                  </head>
                  <note place="inline" resp="editors">This is the most commonly cited letter related to <title level="m">Select Views</title>, largely because it contains Wordsworth’s private complaints 
                        about Wilkinson’s drawings. It begins with his estimate of the best features of his introduction 
                        and an explanation of his rhetorical aims before moving on to dismiss Wilkinson’s artwork. Sir 
                        George (1753–1827, <title level="m">DNB</title>) and Lady Margaret Beaumont were important 
                        patrons of the arts, and Sir George was an amateur landscape painter himself.</note>
                  <p rend="noCount">I am very happy that you have read the Introduction with so much pleasure, and 
                        must thank you for your kindness in telling me of it. I thought the part about the Cottages 
                        well-done; and also liked a sentence where I transport the Reader to the top of one of the 
                        Mountains, or rather to the Cloud chosen for his station, and give a sketch of the impressions 
                        which the Country might be supposed to make on a feeling mind, contemplating its appearance 
                        before it was inhabited. But what I wished to accomplish was to give a model of the manner in 
                        which topographical descriptions ought to be executed, in order to their being either useful or 
                        intelligible, by evolving truly and distinctly one appearance from another. In this I think I have 
                        not wholly failed.</p>
                  <ab rend="center">[ . . . ]</ab>
                  <p rend="noCount">The drawings, or Etchings, or whatever they may be called, are, I know[?], such as 
                        to you and Sir George must be intolerable. You will receive from them that sort of disgust which 
                        I do from bad Poetry, a disgust which can never be felt in its full strength, but by those who 
                        are practised in an art, as well as Amateurs of it. I took Sir George’s subscription as a 
                        kindness done to myself; and Wilkinson though not superabundant in good sense told me that he saw 
                        it in that light. I do however sincerely hope that the Author and his Wife (who certainly, 
                        notwithstanding her faults and foibles, is no ordinary Woman) may be spared any mortification from 
                        hearing them condemned severely by acknowledged judges. They will please many who in all the arts 
                        are most taken with what is most worthless. I do not mean that there is not in simple unadulterated 
                        minds a sense of the beautiful and sublime in art; but into the hands of few such do prints or 
                        picture fall.</p>

                        and prose. Reed had written to Wordsworth in January 1839, thanking him for a copy of the

                        a guide to the mind in kindred scenes and that it cultivates a taste for landscape which finds 
                        its indulgence in the worthy admiration of regions that are accessible to us.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">A complete transcript of this letter appears in <title level="m">Wordsworth

                            Concerning it, Reed wrote (in the May letter mentioned by the poet), “I was not less 
                            surprised than delighted in finding so much more of permanent and universal interest than 
                            I had any reason to look for in a work professedly of an <emph>occasional</emph> character. 
                            I cannot better convey the impression it has made on my mind than by saying that I cherish 
                            it with the same feeling as the poems, and therefore is it that I am anxious to see them 
                            conjoined. No reader, who duly appreciates the latter, can fail to perceive that the Tract 
                            is rich in the same elements of thought and feeling.”</note> and I think myself with some 
                        interest upon its being reprinted hereafter, along with my other writings. . . . It was I repeat 
                        gratifying to me that you should have spoken of that work as you do, and particularly that you 
                        should have considered it in relation to my Poems, somewhat in the same manner you had done in

                        as much of this sort of matter as could be of any real use, appeared to be wanting in this 
                        respect. The employment to which I had by a sort of promise committed myself I found upon 
                        further consideration to be very troublesome and

                        pecuniary emolument, for that was quite trifling, but for the principles of Taste which it 
                        recommended, I turned all that I had written over to Mr. Hudson the Publisher, stipulating only

                  <p rend="noCount">I snatch a moment from the hurry of this place to thank you for the first of 
                            the Series of Letters on the Geology of the Lake district which you have done me the honor 
                            of addressing to me. I received it yesterday from Mr. Danby,<note place="foot" resp="editors">F. C. Danby of Kendal. With Wordsworth’s approval, Hudson and Nicholson 
                                had first approached Sedgwick though this mutual acquaintance.</note> liked it very 
                            much, and am impatient for the rest. It will give the Kendal lake Book so decided a 
                            superiority over every other, that the Publishers have good reason to rejoice. I am happy 
                            to think that my endeavours to illustrate the beautiful Region may be thought not unworthy 
                            of accompanying your scientific researches. I address this to you at random, but hope it will 
                            be forwarded should you be no longer at Cambridge.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">You perhaps don’t remember that the Pocket Hammerers were complained of not by 
                            me in my own person, but in the character of a splenetic Recluse; I will, however, frankly own 
                            that to a certain extent I <emph>sympathized</emph> with my imaginary personage, but I am sure 
                            I need not define for you how far, but no farther, I went along with him. Geology and 
                            <emph>Minerology</emph>  are very different things.</p>

               <p>Our aim is to produce a thoroughly annotated and contextualized edition of Wordsworth's
          "Guide" that will prove useful to students, researchers, and the general public. Our
          edition will feature complete transcriptions of each iteration of the Guide and highlight
          key variants across the five editions Wordsworth oversaw during his lifetime. We will also
          include extensive background information on the Guide including annotations for obscure
          terms, references, and literary allusions as well as maps and photographs of key locations
          in England's Lake District. We hope also to include high-resolution scans of the rarely
          seen Joseph Wilkinson sketches that inspired the Guide‟s original composition.</p>

               <p>William Wordsworth’s experience writing and publishing the original 1810 version of the
            <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> was unlike any other of his sixty-year
          literary career. As detailed in our <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.introduction.html#section3">introduction</ref>, much of this episode’s uniqueness stemmed from his serving as the
          de facto ghost writer for Joseph Wilkinson’s <title level="m">Select Views in Cumberland,
            Westmoreland, and Lancashire</title>. Not only did this arrangement curtail his
          customary liberty to choose his own subject matter and set his own deadlines, but it also
          left Wordsworth largely disenfranchised in matters of when, in what format, and for what
          audience his work would appear. Unsurprisingly, then, the famously independent writer
          quickly came to regret having accepted the <title level="m">Select Views</title>
          commission, and his correspondence from 1810 frequently bemoans having yoked himself to so
          “intolerable” an artist and his “drawings, or Etchings, or whatever they may be called.”

              Wordsworth</title>, ed. Ernest De Sélincourt et al., 2nd ed., 8 vols. (Oxford:
            Clarendon, 1967–1993), 2:449. See also <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.letters.html#letter6">Appendix C, letter 6</ref>). For details on Wilkinson and Wordsworth’s falling out,

               <p>While Wilkinson served as a convenient scapegoat, the poet’s aggravations can largely be
          attributed to his unfamiliarity with, and ultimate unfitness for, the conventions of
          publishing a series of art prints. Prior to <title level="m">Select Views</title>,
          Wordsworth had been deeply, even obsessively, involved in the publication of seven
          editions of his verse and one of his prose.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Wordsworth’s
            first prose book, <title level="m">The Convention of Cintra</title>, appeared in May
            1809. Before then, he had published seven editions of verse: <title level="m">An Evening
              Walk</title> (1793), <title level="m">Descriptive Sketches</title> (1793), four
            editions of <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> (1798, 1800, 1802, and 1805), and
              <title level="m">Poems, in Two Volumes</title> (1807).</note> But all of these
          experiences occurred in the specific fiscal context of the English book trade, where
          editing, typesetting, advertising, and other upfront costs were sufficiently low (albeit
          far from insignificant) that the established publisher or genteel author of the early
          Romantic age could generally afford to underwrite a new title in hopes of recouping the
          investment or even turning a profit upon its release.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Publishing by subscription, of course, remained an option for literary titles during
            the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. But, as James Raven and Michael Gamer have
            shown, literary historians have typically overestimated its prevalence. Raven’s and
            Gamer’s respective surveys suggest only 2–4% of eighteenth-century literary titles in
            Britain were published by subscription. See Raven, <title level="m">The Business of
              Books: Booksellers and the English Book Trade, 1450–1850</title> (New Haven: Yale
            UP, 2007), 316, and Gamer, <title level="m">Romanticism,
              Self-Canonization, and the Business of Poetry</title> (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2017), 76–79.</note> 
          Publishers of prints, however—who were largely
          distinct from specialists in books—faced much steeper upfront costs and were
          therefore considerably more reluctant to risk a title’s completely flopping. Although
          series of collectible engravings had always been a luxury good, prices reached historic
          highs (even adjusting for inflation) in the early nineteenth century. By 1810, nearly two
          decades of war with France had exacerbated ongoing paper and labor shortages; and
          breakthrough, cost-cutting technologies like lithography and wood-based papermaking would
          not permeate the British market until the 1820s and 1830s. Meanwhile, burgeoning European
          and North American demand for art prints had triggered spikes in engravers’ fees,
          especially at the upper reaches of the market. While rates varied widely by region and in
          accordance with a print’s size and level of detail, elite London engravers could charge
          £15 or more for folio plates in 1810. Prices might easily double when working from pencil
          sketches like Wilkinson’s, as capturing subtle variations in shading and line weight
          necessitated the use of labor-intensive soft-ground etching techniques.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On soft-ground etching, see Antony Griffiths, <title level="m">Prints and
              Printmaking: An Introduction to the History and Techniques</title> (Berkeley:
            U of California P, 1996), 97–99. The economics of engraving remains largely
            underexplored. John Ford’s recent study, <title level="m">Rudolph Ackermann and the
              Regency World</title> (Sussex: Warnham Books, 2018), records Ackermann paying £5 per
            plate (£4 for engraving and £1 for each copper plate) for the eighty images in <title level="m">A History of the University of Oxford</title> (1814). These engravings,
            however, were half as large as those in <title level="m">Select Views</title> (quarto
            vs. folio) and would not have required soft-ground etching. See also G. E. Bentley’s
              <title level="m">William Blake in the Desolate Market</title> (McGill-Queen’s UP, 2014),
            which offers a plethora of details regarding engraving pricing
            in general and Blake’s fees in particular. Bentley’s chart on “Blake’s earnings as a
            commercial engraver” (Table 1.3, pp. 18–29) shows that for fifty-two
            engravings—all relatively small and none soft-ground etchings—completed
            between 1800 and 1809, Blake received on average £12.5s. per plate. In or around 1813,
            Blake received £42 for a larger, quarto-sized engraving of Thomas Phillips’s portrait of
              <title level="a">The Right Honourable Earl Spencer.</title>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>No surviving documents record total sales of the 1810 <title level="m">Select
          Views</title>, but circumstantial evidence suggests a small print run of 200 or fewer copies.<note place="foot" resp="editors">This admittedly tenuous estimate is based on
            two data points. First, Ackermann is known to have sold 815 sets of <title level="m">The
              History of the Abbey Church at St. Peter’s, Westminster</title> (1812) and 703 of
              <title level="m">A History of the University of Oxford</title> (1814) (Ford, <title level="m">Rudolph Ackermann</title>, 143). Given that these were among the firm’s most
            popular and heavily marketed series of the early 1810s, a print run of 100–200 copies
            for the considerably more obscure <title level="m">Select Views</title> seems roughly
            commensurate. Second, fewer than forty copies of the 1810 <title level="m">Select
              Views</title> are known to survive in university libraries and other archives
            (WorldCat lists twenty-seven copies, and the Wordsworth Trust owns seven more). If
            roughly as many sets are housed in personal collections, the total of surviving copies
            would fall well short of one hundred.</note> If the circulation was, in fact, this low,
          Wilkinson almost certainly would have been required to subsidize his vanity
          project with personal funds. Even if, hypothetically, the engraver, W. F. Wells, offered
          the bargain rate of £15 per plate for folio-sized soft-ground etchings, total charges for
          the forty-eight engravings would have been £720. In such a scenario, Wilkinson would
          therefore have needed to sell 115 sets at the advertised price of 10s.6d. per installment
          (or £6.6s. for all twelve numbers) just to pay the engravers’ bill. And, judging from
          Ackermann’s ledgers for similar series, engraving expenses may well have accounted for
          under one-third of total production costs for <title level="m">Select Views</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Extrapolating from Ford’s itemized list of Ackermann’s
            production costs for <title level="m">The History of the University of Oxford</title>,
            about two-thirds of the £6.6s. collected for each copy of <title level="m">Select
              Views</title> likely went toward paper (roughly £1.10s. per copy), plate printing
            (£1), letterpress printing (£1), and postage and booksellers’ fees (£1) (<title level="m">Rudolph Ackermann</title>, 143). Factoring in Wordsworth’s and Ackermann’s
            fees and miscellaneous expenses, Wilkinson may well have needed to sell 400 or more sets
            just to break even. </note>
               </p>
               <p>Unfortunately, no Ackermann ledgers are known to survive for 1809–11, when, presumably,
          most expenditures or revenues from <title level="m">Select Views</title> would have been
          logged. The firm’s extant payments book that begins in January 1812, however, records four
          disbursements to Wilkinson between the start of 1812 and February 1813 totaling £217.15s.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Ackermann’s ledgers are archived at Coutts Bank, which
            rarely grants access to historical financial records. Our knowledge of these details is

          these details obviously reveal little about the series’ overall circulation or
          profitability. They do, however, clarify that, like most vanity publications, <title level="m">Select Views</title> was almost certainly produced at the financial risk of
          the author rather than the publisher. Had the series been underwritten by Ackermann, any
          disbursements to Wilkinson would in all probability have occurred either at the point of
          contract (1809) or upon receipt of the final sketches and letterpress (1810). Presuming,
          then, that the series was published at Wilkinson’s expense, these sizeable, and likely
          final, remittances represented not profits but partial reimbursements made upon receipt of
          late-arriving subscriber fees in 1812 and early 1813.</p>
               <p>By most indications, the Wilkinsons were relatively affluent but not so wealthy as to be
          able to spend hundreds of pounds on a passion project without feeling the effects.
          Presumably, then, in contracting with Ackermann rather than self-publishing, the artist
          calculated that any added expenses would be counterbalanced by the London firm’s
          expertise, distribution networks, and increasingly prestigious imprimatur. Even before
          retaining Ackermann—or, for that matter, an engraver or letterpress
          writer—Wilkinson worked to secure enough subscriptions to keep the undertaking from
          proving financially ruinous. His first calls for subscribers appeared in November 1808,
          roughly six months before he made arrangements with Wells, Ackermann, and Wordsworth and
          over a year before the first number of <title level="m">Select Views</title>
            appeared.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See para. 9 and fig. 3 of the <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.introduction.html#para9">introduction</ref> to this edition.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Besides publishing by subscription, another conventional safeguard Wilkinson embraced was
          serializing the set across an entire calendar year. On the first day of each month of
          1810, subscribers to <title level="m">Select Views</title> received installments typically
          consisting of four prints and several letterpress pages. Each number arrived in wrappers
          listing the month’s contents, reprinting the series’ prospectus, and reminding purchasers
          that “Ten Shillings and Sixpence each Number” were “to be paid for on Delivery” (figs. 1
          and 2). For those financing projects like <title level="m">Select Views</title>,
          this mode of distribution had obvious appeal, as it allowed them to spread production
          costs over an entire year and start recouping their investment when subscribers began
          making monthly payments upon receipt of the first installment.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Serial publication also allowed subscribers feeling the pinch of so
            expensive a purchase to pay in monthly installments. Sticker-shock was a real
            possibility, as, according to the <ref target="https://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/ukcompare/"

              Poetry</title>, 75–80. </note> Another clear benefit of this method was the extended
          window it afforded contributors to complete their assigned tasks. At the outset, the plan
          for <title level="m">Select Views</title> was for Wilkinson to submit his finished
          sketches to Wells, who would then, as he completed his etchings, send proofs to Wordsworth
          in Grasmere. As detailed in <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.introduction.html#para19">paras. 19–23</ref> of our general introduction, this process quickly broke down; but,
          at least in theory, the idea was for Wordsworth to receive proofs early enough to key the
          “Descriptions” in his letterpress to specific drawings (fig. 3 below).<note place="foot" resp="editors">The Wordsworth Trust owns a complete set of engraver’s proofs
            (2010.18.2), which shows that at this stage the large script titles for specific images
            had not yet been etched onto the plates. Several proofs also omitted the scheduled month
            of publication, and many sloppily misspelled the names of the artist (e.g., Wilkenson,
            Wikinson, etc.) and publisher (Akermann, Akerman, Ackerman). </note>

               <p>No discernible logic governs the orders in which the printed engravings were originally
          serialized or later reorganized in the table of contents included in the series’ final
          installment. The ordering of Wordsworth’s contributions was, by contrast, relatively
          straightforward, as his <title level="a">Introduction,</title>
                  <title level="a">Section I,</title> and <title level="a">Section II</title> were
          serialized, paginated, and later bound in the exact sequence in which he wrote and
          submitted them. Less certainty, however, has surrounded precisely when specific page
          ranges of his letterpress first appeared in serial numbers. Part of the confusion is owing
          to a 10 May 1810 letter in which the poet informs Lady Beaumont, “I am very happy that you
          have read the Introduction [to <title level="m">Select Views</title>] with so much
          pleasure, and must thank you for your kindness in telling me of it.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

               <p>Such a timeline, however, is contradicted by a <emph>sui generis</emph>, and generally
          overlooked, copy of <title level="m">Select Views</title> at the Yale Center for British
          Art. Originally owned by Wilkinson’s Thetford neighbors the “Ladies FitzRoy” of Euston
          Hall, this is the only known set where all twelve monthly numbers were never removed from
          their original shipping wrappers. Consequently, this set allows us for the first time to
          pinpoint the serialization schedule for every plate and letterpress page in <title level="m">Select Views</title>. As revealed by the unopened installments and detailed in
          the <ref target="#chronotable">table that ends this appendix</ref>, the first seven monthly shipments (January through
          July) brought four Wilkinson prints and four consecutive pages of Wordsworth’s <title level="a">Introduction.</title>
                  <note place="foot" resp="editors">Most of the wrappers in
            this copy (YCBA, Folio A 5188) bear a handwritten note of the “Ladies FitzRoy’s”
            ownership (e.g., Fig. 1). The ladies in question were presumably the wife (Anne) and
            daughter (Georgiana) of Augustus FitzRoy (1735–1811, <title level="m">DNB</title>), the 3rd Duke of Grafton and former
            Prime Minister (1768–70). </note> The first departure from this norm came in August,
          when subscribers received the final six pages of Wordsworth’s introductory section, only
          three prints, and a note from Wilkinson explaining that a fourth print was delayed due to
          “an Accident to the Plate of Furness Abbey” (fig. 4). In light of these details, it
          becomes clear that if, in fact, it was the full text of Wordsworth’s <title level="a">Introduction</title> that Lady Beaumont read “with so much pleasure” in early May, it
          must have been in manuscript rather than published form. For, as the FitzRoy set
          demonstrates, only twenty pages had been published by 1 May and another three months would

               </p>
               <p>The FitzRoy copy at Yale also shows that, while Wilkinson’s two-page dedication shipped
          with the January number, his title and contents pages were, in keeping with custom,
          withheld until the last installment of December. As for the hodge-podge of “descriptions”
          Wordsworth—with considerable assistance from his sister, Dorothy—begrudgingly
          wrote after completing his <title level="a">Introduction,</title> the two-page-long <title level="a">Section I</title> appeared in September, the first four pages of <title level="a">Section II</title> in October, and—following the conspicuous absence of
          letterpress pages in November—the concluding six pages of <title level="a">Section
            II</title> in December.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For details on Wordsworth’s
            dilatory composition of Sections I and II, see <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.introduction.html#para18">paras. 18–23</ref> of our introduction. Sending the title and contents pages with the
            final installment was a conventional way to avoid reprinting front matter if the
            contents changed during serialization (Griffiths, <title level="m">The Print Before
              Photography</title>, 359–61).</note>
               </p>
               <p>More generally, this remarkable set at Yale suggests the diverse motivations, not always
          grounded in aesthetic taste, that could impel well-heeled Britons to subscribe to such a
          series. While we know little about Wilkinson’s relationship with the FitzRoys, that no
          member of their household deigned to open even a single installment of <title level="m">Select Views</title> suggests their subscription owed more to neighborly duty or
          noblesse oblige than to heartfelt admiration for the rector’s art. Oddly, though, despite
          the family’s apparent apathy toward Wilkinson’s drawings, they went a step beyond
          subscribing, arranging to have all forty-eight plates hand-colored before leaving
          Ackermann’s shop.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Another expertly colored copy of <title level="m">Select Views</title> can be seen at the Wordsworth Trust. While added
            expense and some collectors’ aversion to altering originals kept this practice
            relatively rare, Ackermann is said to have retained a team of specialized colorists
            consisting of British women and émigrés from revolutionary France (Antony Griffiths,
              <title level="m">The Print Before Photography</title>, 144–154, esp. 147). </note>
               </p>
               <p>In the run-up to publication, advertisements for <title level="m">Select Views</title> warned that the series
          would either be unavailable or would cost considerably more after the subscriber deadline.
          This proved a bluff, as in coming years Ackermann advertised leftover sets “in boards” for
          the same £6.6s. paid by original subscribers. <note place="foot" resp="editors">See, e.g., Ackermann’s stock
            lists in the end pages of <title level="m">Naples and the Campagna Felice</title> (London: Ackermann, 1815) and the
            <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title> for April 1815.</note> Even that price may have proven too high, though, as
          deeply discounted second-hand copies began showing up in estate-sale advertisements and
          book catalogues by the mid-1810s. In 1816, for instance, the Newcastle bookseller Emerson
          Charnley advertised two used sets of <title level="m">Select Views</title>, one “elegantly half-bound in Russia”
          leather for £3.13s.6d and another still sewn in its original wrappers for £3.3s. A year
          later, Richard Priestley of London shaved an additional 30% off the original price,
          offering a pre-owned set for £2.12s.6d. In ensuing decades, not even increasing awareness
          of Wordsworth’s connection to <title level="m">Select Views</title> could check this trend, as second-hand sets in
          boards went for £1.1s. in 1837 and 10s.6d. in 1851. This depreciation continued into the early
          twentieth century, when bound copies were advertised for 12s. in 1903 and 18s. in 1917.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <title level="m">A Catalogue of Books, Now on Sale by Emerson Charnley, Newcastle</title> (Newcastle:
            S. Hodgson, 1816), pp. 15–16; R. Priestley, <title level="m">A Catalogue of Books, for 1817</title> (London: J.
          Adland, 1817), p. 372; A. E. Evans catalogue, p. 12, advertising supplement to the

              Records</title>, vol. 14 (London: Karslake, 1917), p. 38.</note> Testifying, however, to the ongoing
          vagaries of the antiquarian book market, surviving copies of <title level="m">Select Views</title> have since
          regained their value and then some. At this writing in early 2020, online dealers are
          asking £45 for individual Wilkinson prints from a dissembled copy of <title level="m">Select Views</title>, £1,200
          for a bound copy of his 1821 reprint, and £1,800 for an 1810 set still in boards.
          Presumably, much of this surge in prices can be chalked up to Wordsworth’s enduring
          importance in literary studies and the increased scarcity brought on by university
          libraries scooping up and locking away many of the copies that come up for sale.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">Our aim is to produce a thoroughly annotated and contextualized edition of Wordsworth's Guide to the Lakes that will prove
                    useful to students, researchers, and the general public. Our edition will feature complete transcriptions of the first and final editions of the Guide and highlight key variants across the five editions Wordsworth oversaw during his lifetime. We will also include extensive
                    background information on the Guide including annotations for obscure terms, references, and literary allusions as well as maps
                    and photographs of key locations in England's Lake District. We will include high-resolution scans of the rarely seen
                    Joseph Wilkinson sketches that inspired the Guide's original composition. The edition will also provide a bibliography of scholarship on the Guide and an appendix comprised of Wordsworth-circle letters related to the text.</p>

          The poet Thomas Gray toured the Lake District in 1769 and subsequently sent
            transcriptions of his journal to his friend Thomas Wharton. Though not intended for
            publication, this journal was printed posthumously in William Mason’s edition of
              <emph>The Poems of Mr. Gray</emph> (1775). Five years later the text was incorporated
            in the second edition of Thomas West’s <emph>Guide</emph>, thus becoming a permanent part of the
            tourist literature. Wordsworth owned Mason’s 1776 edition of Gray as well as West’s
            guidebook.</p>

            Scar is a series of long, cavern-filled limestone cliffs that run along the route of the
            old A65. The natural curiosity Wordsworth mentions (the well) intrigued tour writers
            from the eighteenth century forward. An underground syphon seems to be the most likely
            explanation for the rise and fall of the water, which is less frequent and dramatic now
            than it was in Wordsworth’s time. The well may still be seen at the side of the road at
            the base of the cliffs. (Photo by kind courtesy of http://www.yorkshire-dales.com and

          Lt. Col. William Mudge (1762–1820) was among the first great surveyors of the region.
            His findings, including his extensive observations from Black Combe, were published in
            1811 in <emph>An Account of the Trigonometrical Survey, Carried on by Order of the
              Master-General of His Majesty’s Ordnance</emph>. Wordsworth’s fascination with Mudge’s
            surveys is evident in two sonnets of 1811, “Written with a Slate Pencil on a Stone, on
            the Side of the Mountain of Black Comb” and “View from the Top of Black Comb.”</p>

          The Marshalls were intimates of the Wordsworths, Jane Marshall (née Pollard) being one
            of Dorothy’s oldest friends. According to a Ph.D. thesis by Derek Denman, John Marshall
            purchased lands in the Buttermere, Crummock, and Loweswater area from 1814 onwards. Owen
            and Smyser cite an apposite letter, dated 12 July 1816, from Sarah Hutchinson to Thomas
            Monkhouse: “William and I spent three days, the week before last, with Mr Marshall at
            Scale Hill, Lowess Water, Buttermere, &amp; Crumock [sic], viewing his estates and manor
            there, and planning his proposed plantations and Improvements. He is going to plant very
            largely by the side of the two last lakes—and, as he will only plant native wood, and in
            no wise sacrifice beauty to convenience, we expect that his labours will not only be
            profitable but ornamental.”</p>

          The “new” chapel mentioned by Wordsworth has since been replaced by a building
            constructed in 1881 (All Saints Church, Watermillock). However, the tower at the
            building’s west end dates from the 1550s. Bishop Owen Oglethorpe, who consecrated the
            fifteenth-century building, was the lone clergyman willing to crown Elizabeth I in 1559
            because of her public Protestantism. He came to regret that decision. Queen Elizabeth
            imprisoned him months later, and he died a religious martyr. Photo: Bob Jenkins, Wikimedia Commons.</p>

          Also known as Saint Bede (c. 673–735), the monk often called “the Father of English
            History.” His mention of Dacre (“Dacore”) appears in his <emph>Ecclesiastical History of

          The cloud’s-eye vision Wordsworth conjures here is easy to understand with the help of
            a map. Wordsworth was fond of this passage. In a letter to Lady Beaumont (10 May 1810),
            he wrote, “I am very happy that you have read the Introduction [to <emph>Select Views</emph>] with so
            much pleasure…. I though the part about the Cottages well-done; and also liked a
            sentence where I transport the Reader to the top of one of the Mountains, or rather to
            the Cloud chosen for his station, and give a sketch of the impressions which the Country
            might be supposed to make on a feeling mind, contemplating its appearance before it was
            inhabited.” Commentators have debated the originality of Wordsworth’s wheel metaphor,
            but it seems to be his own invention (Owen and Smyser 388-89).</p>

          The Windermere island Wordsworth calls “Chapel-Holm” is more commonly known as Lady Holme

            established there in medieval times. St. Herbert’s Island on Derwentwater is named for
            the seventh-century anchorite who had his hermitage there. The island became a place of
            pilgrimage by 1374, when the Bishop of Carlisle ordered the vicar of Crosthwaite to
            celebrate mass there on the saint’s feast day and offered forty-day indulgences to
            participants. See Wordsworth’s inscription poem “For the Spot Where the Hermitage Stood

          Derwentwater’s floating island has long been a curiosity, varying in size during its
            different appearances. Early writers on the Lakes offered various ingenious speculations
            on the science behind it. Wordsworth wrote about a “floating island” in the

          The 1810 edition is more definitive, claiming that nightingales are never found as far
            north as the Lake District. As De Selincourt points out, if Wordsworth revised this
            passage because he believed he had observed a nightingale in Cumbria between 1810 and
            1820, he must have been mistaken, as all ornithological studies suggest the bird never
            journeys this far north.</p>

          Wordsworth’s contention here is generally true, in part because most landscape
            paintings by these “ancient masters” of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were set
            in classical or Biblical lands. Titian (1488/1490-1576) was born in the village of Pieve
            di Cavore in the Italian Alps and lived much of his life in nearby Venice. Nicolas
            Poussin (1594-1665) and his brother-in-law Gaspard Dughet (self-styled “Gaspard
            Poussin”) (1615-1675) lived primarily in Paris and Rome, respectively, and spent little
            to no time in the Alps (although Nicolas did paint <emph>Hannibal Crossing the
              Alps</emph> in 1625-1627). The French painter Claude Lorrain (1600-1682) visited Tyrol
            and Bavaria in his twenties but was generally more drawn to beautiful or picturesque
            settings than sublime landscapes like the Alps. The minor Italian painters Pellegrino
            Tibaldi (1527-1596) and Bernardino Luini (c. 1482-1532) both resided in Milan, which is
            located at the southern base of the Alps.</p>

            (1775-1851), who painted a series of Alpine landscapes after returning to England from
            Switzerland in 1802. Wordsworth might also have been thinking of Philip James de
            Loutherbourg (1740-1812), the German-born but London-based painter of <emph>Avalanche in
              the Alps</emph> (1803). Illustration: De Loutherbourg’s <emph>Avalanche in the

            collection. In his 1843 collected works, he added the following note: “Rydal Mount,
            1816. The lady was Miss Blackett, then residing with Mr. Montagu Burgoyne, at Fox-Ghyll.
            We were tempted to remain too long upon the mountain, and I imprudently, with the hope
            of shortening the way, led her among the crags and down a steep slope, which entangled
            us in difficulties, that were met by her with much spirit and courage.”</p>

          This was more than just a fancy, as the primary purpose for this excursion was to
            purchase a property suitable for the growing Wordsworth clan. Thanks to the assistance
            of his patron, Lord Lowther, Wordsworth was soon thereafter able to acquire the Broad
            How farm near Ullswater. Wordsworth never built a family home on the site and sold the

                     <title level="m">A Guide through the District of the Lakes in the North of England</title> (1835) is the best-known version of Wordsworth’s guidebook, the last edition substantially revised by the author, and the one most often reprinted. This electronic edition offers an enriched reading experience of Wordsworth’s definitive text. Its extensive annotations include not only textual notes and content aids but also dozens of illustrations—far more than would be possible in a standard print edition. All live links are indicated by <hi rendition="#color(365F91)">blue text</hi>. Clicking on a link brings up a box containing an editorial note and, where available, a thumbnail image. An additional click on the thumbnail brings
        up an enlarged version at higher resolution. Numbered notes are Wordsworth’s own, not the editors’. Readers curious about locations (some two hundred of them) mentioned in the text may also wish to consult this edition’s “<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/places-map">Mapping the Lakes</ref>” appendix, which makes visualizing places and their relationships to each other easier. </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">This edition does not recreate the typography or pagination of the 1835 edition, but it retains its spelling, punctuation, and so forth, correcting only obvious printer’s errors silently. As the itinerary tables included at the end of the 1835 edition were prepared by Wordsworth’s publishers rather than by the poet, we have chosen not to transcribe them. We have, however, included scanned page images from the 1835 text for reference.</p>

               <p>In preparing this Manual, it was the Author's principal wish to furnish a Guide or
          Companion for the <emph>Minds</emph> of Persons of taste, and feeling for Landscape, who
          might be inclined to explore the District of the Lakes with that degree of attention to
          which its beauty may fairly lay claim. For the more sure attainment, however, of this
          primary object, he will begin by undertaking the humble and tedious task of supplying the
          Tourist with directions how to approach the several scenes in their best, or most
          convenient, order. But first, <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n002.html">supposing the approach to be made from
            the south</ref>, and through Yorkshire, there are certain interesting spots which may
          be confidently recommended to his notice, if time can be spared before entering upon the
          Lake District; and the route may be changed in returning.</p>
               <p>There are three approaches to the Lakes through Yorkshire; the least adviseable is the <pb rend="none"/>
                  <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n003.html">great north road</ref> by Catterick and Greta Bridge, and onwards to
          Penrith. <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n004.html">The Traveller, however, taking this route, might halt at
            Greta Bridge</ref>, and be well recompenced if he can afford to give an hour or two to
          the banks of the Greta, and of the <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n005.html">Tees, at Rokeby</ref>. <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n006.html">Barnard Castle</ref> also, about two miles up the Tees, is a striking
          object, and the main North Road might be rejoined at Bowes. Every one has heard of the
            <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n007.html">great fall of the Tees</ref> above <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n008.html">Middleham</ref>, interesting for its grandeur, as the avenue of rocks that leads to it,
          is to the geologist. But this place lies so far out of the way as scarcely to be within
          the compass of our notice. It might, however, be visited by a Traveller on foot, or on
          horseback, who could rejoin the main road upon Stanemoor.</p>
               <p>The second road leads through a more interesting tract of country, beginning at Ripon,
          from which place see <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n009.html">Fountain's Abbey, and thence by Hackfall, and
            Masham, to Jervaux Abbey</ref>, and up the vale of Wensley; turning aside before Askrigg
          is reached, to see <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n010.html">Aysgarth-force</ref>, upon the Ure; and again, near
          Hawes, to <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n011.html">Hardraw Scar</ref>, of which, with its waterfall, Turner has
          a fine drawing. Thence over the fells to Sedbergh, and Kendal.</p>
               <p>The third approach from Yorkshire is through Leeds. Four miles beyond that town are the
          ruins of <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n012.html">Kirkstall Abbey</ref>, should that road to Skipton be chosen;
          but the other by Otley may be made much more interesting by turning off at Addington to
          Bolton Bridge, for the <pb rend="none"/> sake of visiting the Abbey and grounds. It would be well,
          however, for a party previously to secure beds, if wanted, at the inn, as there is but
          one, and it is much resorted to in summer.</p>
               <p>The Traveller on foot, or horseback, would do well to follow the banks of the Wharf
          upwards, to Burnsall, and thence cross over the hills to <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n013.html">Gordale</ref>—a noble scene, beautifully described in <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n015.html">Gray's Tour</ref>, and with which no one can be disappointed. Thence to Malham, where
          there is a respectable village inn, and so on, by <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n014.html">Malham Cove</ref>,
          to Settle.</p>
               <p>Travellers in carriages must go from Bolton Bridge to Skipton, where they rejoin the main
          road; and should they be inclined to visit Gordale, a tolerable road turns off beyond
          Skipton. Beyond Settle, under <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n016.html">Giggleswick Scar, the road passes an
            ebbing and flowing well</ref>, worthy the notice of the Naturalist. Four miles to the
          right of Ingleton, is <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n017.html">Weathercote Cave</ref>, a fine object, but
          whoever diverges for this, must return to Ingleton. Near <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n018.html">Kirkby
            Lonsdale observe the view from the bridge over the Lune</ref>, and descend to the
          channel of the river, and by no means omit looking at the <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n019.html">Vale of Lune
            from the Church-yard</ref>.</p>
               <p>The journey towards the lake country through Lancashire, is, with the exception of the
          Vale of the Ribble, at Preston, uninteresting; till you come near Lancaster, and obtain a
          view of the fells and mountains of Lancashire and Westmorland; with <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n020.html">Lancaster Castle</ref>, and the <pb rend="none"/> Tower of the Church seeming to make part of the
          Castle, in the foreground.</p>
               <p>They who wish to see the celebrated ruins of <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n021.html">Furness Abbey</ref>, and
          are not afraid of crossing <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n022.html">the Sands</ref>, may go from Lancaster to
          Ulverston; from which place take the direct road to Dalton; but by all means return
          through <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n023.html">Urswick, for the sake of the view from the top of the
            hill</ref>, before descending into the grounds of <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n024.html">Conishead
            Priory</ref>. From this quarter the Lakes would be advantageously approached by
          Coniston; thence to Hawkshead, and by the Ferry over Windermere, to Bowness: a much better
          introduction than by going direct from Coniston to Ambleside, which ought not to be done,
          as that would greatly take off from the effect of Windermere.</p>
               <p>Let us now go back to Lancaster. The direct road thence to Kendal is 22 miles, but by
          making a circuit of eight miles, the Vale of the Lune to Kirkby Lonsdale will be included.
          The whole tract is pleasing; there is one view mentioned by Gray and Mason especially so.
          In <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n025.html">West's Guide</ref> it is thus pointed out:— “About a quarter
          of a mile beyond the third mile-stone, where the road makes a turn to the right, there is
          a gate on the left which leads into a field where the station meant, will be found.” Thus
          far for those who approach the Lakes from the South.</p>
               <p>Travellers from the North would do well to go from Carlisle by Wigton, and proceed along
          the Lake of Bassenthwaite to Keswick; or, if<pb rend="none"/> convenience should take them first to
          Penrith, it would still be better to cross the country to Keswick, and begin with that
          vale, rather than with Ulswater. It is worth while to mention, in this place, that the
          banks of the river Eden, about Corby, are well worthy of notice, both on account of their
          natural beauty, and the <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n026.html">viaducts which have recently been carried over
            the bed of the river</ref>, and over a neighbouring ravine. In the Church of Wetherby,
          close by, is <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n027.html">a fine piece of monumental sculpture by Nollekins</ref>.
          The scenes of Nunnery, upon the Eden, or rather that part of them which is upon Croglin, a
          mountain stream there falling into the Eden, are, in their way, unrivalled. But the
          nearest road thither, from Corby, is so bad, that no one can be advised to take it in a
          carriage. Nunnery may be reached from Corby by making a circuit and crossing the Eden at
          Armathwaite bridge. A portion of this road, however, is bad enough.</p>
               <anchor xml:id="para11"/>
               <p>As much the greatest number of Lake Tourists begin by passing from Kendal to Bowness,
          upon Windermere, our notices shall commence with that Lake. Bowness is situated upon its
          eastern side, and at equal distance from each extremity of the Lake of
          <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <hi rendition="#center">WINDERMERE.</hi>
                  <lb/>
         The lower part of this Lake is rarely visited, but has many interesting points of view,
          especially at <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n028.html">Storr's Hall</ref> and at Fell-foot, where <pb rend="none"/> the
          Coniston Mountains peer nobly over the western barrier, which elsewhere, along the whole
          Lake, is comparatively tame. To one also who has ascended the hill from Grathwaite on the
          western side, the Promontory called Rawlinson's Nab, Storr's Hall, and the Troutbeck
          Mountains, about sunset, make a splendid landscape. The view from the Pleasure-house of
          the Station near the Ferry has <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n029.html">suffered much from Larch
            plantations</ref>; this mischief, however, is gradually disappearing, and the Larches,
          under the management of the proprietor, Mr. Curwen, are giving way to the native wood.
          Windermere ought to be seen both from its shores and from its surface. None of the other
          Lakes unfold so many fresh beauties to him who sails upon them. This is owing to its
          greater size, to the islands, and to its having <emph>two</emph> vales at the
          head, with their accompanying mountains of nearly equal dignity. Nor can the grandeur of
          these two terminations be seen at once from any point, except from the bosom of the Lake.
          The Islands may be explored at any time of the day; but one bright unruffled evening,
          must, if possible, be set apart for the splendour, the stillness, and solemnity of a three
          hour’s voyage upon the higher division of the Lake, not omitting, towards the end of the
          excursion, to quit the expanse of water, and peep into the close and calm River at the
          head; which, in its quiet character, at such a time, appears rather like an overflow of
          the peaceful Lake <pb rend="none"/> itself, than to have any more immediate connection with the rough
          mountains whence it has descended, or the turbulent torrents by which it is supplied. Many
          persons content themselves with what they see of Windermere during their progress in a
          boat from Bowness to the head of the Lake, walking thence to Ambleside. But the whole road
          from Bowness is rich in diversity of pleasing or grand scenery; there is scarcely a field
          on the road side, which, if entered, would not give to the landscape some additional
          charm. Low-wood Inn, a mile from the head of Windermere, is a most pleasant halting-place;
          no inn in the whole district is so agreeably situated for water views and excursions; and
          the fields above it, and the lane that leads to Troutbeck, present beautiful views towards
          each extremity of the Lake. From this place, and from

        May be conveniently visited from Ambleside, but is seen to most advantage by entering the
          country over <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n036.html">the Sands</ref> from Lancaster. The Stranger, from the
          moment he sets his foot on those Sands, seems to leave the turmoil and traffic of the
          world behind him; and, crossing the majestic plain whence the sea has retired, he beholds,
          rising apparently from its base, the cluster of mountains among which he is going to
          wander, and towards whose recesses, by the Vale of Coniston, he is gradually and
          peacefully led. From the Inn at the head of Coniston Lake, a leisurely Traveller might
          have much pleasure in looking into Yewdale and Tilberthwaite, returning to his Inn from
          the head of Yewdale by a mountain track which has the farm of Tarn Hows, a little on the
          right: by this road is seen much <pb rend="none"/>the best view of Coniston Lake from the south. At
          the head of Coniston Water there is an agreeable Inn, from which an enterprising Tourist
          might go to the Vale of the Duddon, over Walna Scar, down to Seathwaite, Newfield, and to
          the rocks where the river issues from a narrow pass into the broad Vale. The stream is
          very interesting for the space of a mile above this point, and below, by Ulpha Kirk, till
          it enters the Sands, where it is overlooked by the solitary Mountain <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n037.html">Black Comb</ref>, the summit of which, as that experienced surveyor, <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n038.html">Colonel Mudge</ref>, declared, commands a more extensive view than any

        Over Birker moor, to Birker-force, at the head of the finest ravine in the country; and
          thence up the Vale of the Esk, by Hardknot and Wrynose, back to Ambleside. Near the road,
          in ascending from Eskdale, are conspicuous remains of a <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n040.html">Roman
            fortress</ref>. Details of the Duddon and Donnerdale are given in the Author's series of
            <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n041.html">Sonnets upon the Duddon and in the accompanying Notes</ref>. In
          addition to its two Vales at its head, Windermere communicates with two lateral Vallies;
          that of Troutbeck, distinguished by the mountains at its head—by picturesque
          remains of cottage architecture; and, towards the lower part, by bold foregrounds formed
          by the steep and winding banks of the river. This Vale, as before mentioned, may be most
          conveniently seen from Low Wood. The other lateral Valley, that of Hawkshead, is visited
          to most advantage, and most conveniently, from Bowness; crossing the Lake by the
          Ferry—then pass the two villages of Sawrey, and on quitting the latter, you have a
          fine view of the Lake of Esthwaite, and the cone of one of the Langdale Pikes in the
          distance.</p>
               <p>Before you leave Ambleside give three minutes to looking at a passage of the brook which
          runs through the town; it is to be seen from a garden on the right bank of the stream, a
          few steps above the bridge—the garden at<pb rend="none"/> present is rented by Mrs.
            Airey.—<ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n042.html">Stockgill-force</ref>, upon the same stream, will have
          been mentioned to you as one of the sights of the neighbourhood. And by a Tourist halting
          a few days in Ambleside, the <emph>Nook</emph> also might be visited; a spot
          where there is a bridge over Scandale-beck, which makes a pretty subject for the pencil.
          Lastly, for residents of a week or so at Ambleside, there are delightful rambles over
          every part of Loughrigg Fell and among the enclosures on its sides; particularly about
          Loughrigg Tarn, and on its eastern side about <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n043.html">Fox How</ref> and the

          looking back towards Ambleside. The horse road also, along the western side of the Lake,

          of a fine evening, will make, from the bosom of the Lake, an impression that will be
          scarcely ever effaced. </p>
               <p> The direct road from Grasmere to Keswick does not (as has been observed of Rydal Mere)
          shew to advantage <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n047.html">Thirlmere</ref>, or Wythburn Lake, with its
          surrounding mountains. By a Traveller proceeding at leisure, a deviation ought to be made
          from the main road, when he has advanced a little beyond the sixth mile-stone short of
          Keswick, from which point there is a noble view of the Vale of Legberthwaite, with
          Blencathra (commonly called Saddle-back) in front. Having previously enquired, at the Inn
          near Wythburn Chapel, the best way from this mile-stone to the bridge that divides the
          Lake, he must cross it, and proceed with the Lake on the right, to the hamlet a little
          beyond its termination, and rejoin the main road upon Shoulthwaite Moss, about four miles
          from Keswick; or, if on foot, the Tourist may <pb rend="none"/> follow the stream that issues from
          Thirlmere down the romantic Vale of St. John's, and so (enquiring the way at some cottage)
          to Keswick, by a circuit of little more than a mile. A more interesting tract of country
          is scarcely any where to be seen, than the road between Ambleside and Keswick, with the
          deviations that have been pointed out. Helvellyn may be conveniently ascended from the Inn
          at Wythburn. <lb/>

               </p>
               <p> This Vale stretches, without winding, nearly North and South, from the head of Derwent
          Water to the foot of Bassenthwaite Lake. It communicates with Borrowdale on the South;
          with the river Greta, and Thirlmere, on the East, with which the Traveller has become
          acquainted on his way from Ambleside; and with the Vale of Newlands on the
          West—which last Vale he may pass through, in going to, or returning from,
          Buttermere. The best views of Keswick Lake are from Crow Park; Frier's Crag; the
          Stable-field, close by; the Vicarage, and from various points in taking the circuit of the
          Lake. More distant views, and perhaps full as interesting, are from the side of Latrigg,
          from Ormathwaite, and Applethwaite; and thence along the road at the foot of Skiddaw
          towards Bassenthwaite, for about a quarter of a mile. There are fine bird's eye views from
          the Castle-hill; from <pb rend="none"/> Ashness, on the road to Watenlath, and by following the
          Watenlath stream downwards to the <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n049.html">Cataract of Lodore</ref>. This Lake
          also, if the weather be fine, ought to be circumnavigated. There are good views along the
          western side of Bassenthwaite Lake, and from Armathwaite at its foot; but the eastern side
          from the high road has little to recommend it. The Traveller from Carlisle, approaching by
          way of Ireby, has, from the old road on the top of Bassenthwaite-hawse, much the most
          striking view of the Plain and Lake of Bassenthwaite, flanked by Skiddaw, and terminated
          by Wallowcrag on the south-east of Derwent Lake; the same point commands an extensive view
          of Solway Frith and the Scotch Mountains. They who take the circuit of Derwent Lake, may
          at the same time include BORROWDALE, going as far as Bowder-stone, or Rosthwaite.
          Borrowdale is also conveniently seen on the way to Wastdale over Styhead; or, to
          Buttermere, by Seatoller and Honister Crag; or, going over the Stake, through Langdale, to
          Ambleside. Buttermere may be visited by a shorter way through Newlands, but though the
          descent upon the Vale of Buttermere, by this approach, is very striking, as it also is to
          one entering by the head of the Vale, under Honister Crag, yet, after all, the best
          entrance from Keswick is from the lower part of the Vale, having gone over Whinlater to
          Scale Hill, where there is a roomy Inn, with very good accommodation. The Mountains of the

          which the Inn stands, and turning to the right, after the opposite hill has been ascended
          a little way, then follow the road for half a mile or so that leads towards Lorton,

               <p>But this small Lake is only approached to advantage from the other end; therefore any
          Traveller going by this road to Wasdale, must look back upon it. This road to Wastdale,
          after passing the village of Lamplugh Cross, presents suddenly a fine view of the Lake of
          Ennerdale, with its Mountains; and, six or seven miles beyond, leads down upon <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n051.html">Calder Abbey</ref>. Little of this ruin is left, but that little is well
          worthy of notice. At Calder Bridge are two comfortable Inns, and, a few miles beyond,

          from the open country by the Strands at its foot. This last is much the best approach.
          Wastdale is well worth the notice of the Traveller who is not afraid of fatigue; no part
          of the country is more distinguished by sublimity. Wastwater may also be visited from
          Ambleside; by going up Langdale, over Hardknot and Wrynose —down Eskdale and by
          Irton Hall to the Strands; but this road can only be taken on foot, or on horseback, or in

                  <lb/>
       As being, perhaps, upon the whole, the happiest combination of beauty and grandeur, which
          any of the Lakes affords. It lies not more than ten miles from Ambleside, and the <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n053.html">Pass of Kirkstone</ref> and the descent from it are very impressive; but,
          notwithstanding, this Vale, like the others, loses much of its effect by being entered
          from the head: so that it is better to go from Keswick through Matterdale, and descend
          upon Gowbarrow Park; you are thus brought at once upon a magnifi<!-- - --><pb rend="none"/>cent view of the
          two higher reaches of the Lake. <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n054.html">Ara-force</ref> thunders down the
          Ghyll on the left, at a small distance from the road. If Ullswater be approached from
          Penrith, a mile and a half brings you to the winding vale of Eamont, and the prospects
          increase in interest till you reach Patterdale; but the first four miles along Ullswater
          by this road are comparatively tame; and in order to see the lower part of the Lake to
          advantage, it is necessary to go round by Pooley Bridge, and to ride at least three miles
          along the Westmorland side of the water, towards Martindale. The views, especially if you
          ascend from the road into the fields, are magnificent; yet this is only mentioned that the
          transient Visitant may know what exists; for it would be inconvenient to go in search of
          them. They who take this course of three or four miles <emph>on foot</emph>,
          should have a boat in readiness at the end of the walk, to carry them across to the
          Cumberland side of the Lake, near Old Church, thence to pursue the road upwards to
          Patterdale. The Church-yard <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n055.html">Yew-tree still survives at Old
            Church</ref>, but there are no remains of a Place of Worship, a New Chapel having been
          erected in a more central situation, which Chapel was consecrated by the then Bishop of
          Carlisle, when on his way to crown Queen Elizabeth, he being the only Prelate who would
          undertake the office. It may be here mentioned that Bassenthwaite Chapel yet stands in a
          bay as sequestered as the Site of Old Church; <pb rend="none"/> such situations having been chosen in
          disturbed times to elude marauders. </p>
               <p> The Trunk, or Body of the Vale of Ullswater need not be further noticed, as its beauties
          show themselves: but the curious Traveller may wish to know something of its tributary
          Streams. </p>
               <p> At Dalemain, about three miles from Penrith, a Stream is crossed called the Dacre, or
          Dacor, which name it bore as early as the time of the <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n057.html">Venerable
            Bede</ref>. This stream does not enter the Lake, but joins the Eamont a mile below. It
          rises in the moorish Country about Penruddock, flows down a soft sequestered Valley,
          passing by the ancient mansions of <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n058.html">Hutton John</ref> and <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n059.html">Dacre Castle</ref>. The former is pleasantly situated, though of a
          character somewhat gloomy and monastic, and from some of the fields near Dalemain, Dacre
          Castle, backed by the jagged summit of Saddleback, with the Valley and Stream in front,
          forms a grand picture. There is no other stream that conducts to any glen or valley worthy
          of being mentioned, till we reach that which leads up to Ara-force, and thence into
          Matterdale, before spoken of. Matterdale, though a wild and interesting spot, has no
          peculiar features that would make it worth the Stranger's while to go in search of them;
          but, in <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n060.html">Gowbarrow Park</ref>, the lover of Nature might linger for
          hours. Here is a powerful Brook, which dashes among rocks through a deep glen, hung on
          every side with a rich and happy <pb rend="none"/> intermixture of native wood; here are beds of
          luxuriant fern, aged hawthorns, and hollies decked with honeysuckles; and fallow-deer
          glancing and bounding over the lawns and through the thickets. These are the attractions
          of the retired views, or constitute a foreground for ever-varying pictures of the majestic
          Lake, forced to take a winding course by bold promontories, and environed by mountains of
          sublime form, towering above each other. At the outlet of Gowbarrow Park, we reach a third
          stream, which flows through a little recess called Glencoin, where lurks a single house,
          yet visible from the road. Let the Artist or leisurely Traveller turn aside to it, for the
          buildings and objects around them are romantic and picturesque. Having passed under the
          steeps of Styebarrow Crag, and the remains of its native woods, at Glenridding Bridge, a
          fourth Stream is crossed. </p>
               <p> The opening on the side of Ullswater Vale, down which this Stream flows, is adorned with
          fertile fields, cottages, and natural groves, that agreeably unite with the transverse
          views of the Lake; and the Stream, if followed up after the enclosures are left behind,
          will lead along bold water-breaks and waterfalls to a silent Tarn in the recesses of
          Helvellyn. This desolate spot was formerly haunted by eagles, that built in the precipice
          which forms its western barrier. These birds used to wheel and hover round the head of the
          solitary angler. It also derives a melancholy interest <pb rend="none"/> from the <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n061.html">fate of a young man, a stranger</ref>, who perished some years ago, by falling down the
          rocks in his attempt to cross over to Grasmere. His remains were discovered by means of a
          faithful dog that had lingered here for the space of three months, self-supported, and
          probably retaining to the last an attachment to the skeleton of its master. But to return
          to the road in the main Vale of Ullswater.—At the head of the Lake (being now in
          Patterdale) we cross a fifth Stream, Grisdale Beck: this would conduct through a woody
          steep, where may be seen some unusually large ancient hollies, up to the level area of the
          Valley of Grisdale; hence there is a path for foot-travellers, and along which a horse may
          be led, to Grasmere. A sublime combination of mountain forms appears in front while
          ascending the bed of this valley, and the impression increases till the path leads almost
          immediately under the projecting masses of Helvellyn. Having retraced the banks of the
          Stream to Patterdale, and pursued the road up the main Dale, the next considerable stream
          would, if ascended in the same manner, conduct to Deep-dale, the character of which Valley
          may be conjectured from its name. It is terminated by a cove, a craggy and gloomy abyss,
          with precipitous sides; a faithful receptacle of the snows that are driven into it, by the
          west wind, from the summit of Fairfield. Lastly, having gone along the western side of
          Brotherswater and passed Hartsop Hall, a Stream soon after is<!-- - --><pb rend="none"/>sues from a cove
          richly decorated with native wood. This spot is, I believe, never explored by Travellers;
          but, from these sylvan and rocky recesses, whoever looks back on the gleaming surface of
          Brotherswater, or forward to the precipitous sides and lofty ridges of Dove Crag, &amp;,
          will be equally pleased with the beauty, the grandeur, and the wildness of the scenery. </p>
               <p> Seven Glens or Vallies have been noticed, which branch off from the Cumberland side of
          the Vale. The opposite side has only two Streams of any importance, one of which would
          lead up from the point where it crosses the Kirkstone-road, near the foot of
          Brotherswater, to the decaying hamlet of Hartsop, remarkable for its cottage architecture,
          and thence to Hayswater, much frequented by anglers. The other, coming down Martindale,
          enters Ullswater at Sandwyke, opposite to Gowbarrow Park. No persons but such as come to
          Patterdale, merely to pass through it, should fail to walk as far as Blowick, the only
          enclosed land which on this side borders the higher part of the Lake. The axe has here
          indiscriminately levelled a rich wood of birches and oaks, that divided this favoured spot
          into a hundred pictures. It has yet its land-locked bays, and rocky promontories; but
          those beautiful woods are gone, which <emph>perfected</emph> its seclusion; and
          scenes, that might formerly have been compared to an inexhaustible volume, are now spread
          before the eye in a sin<!-- - --><pb rend="none"/>gle sheet—magnificent indeed, but seemingly perused
          in a moment! From Blowick a narrow track conducts along the craggy side of Place-fell,
          richly adorned with juniper, and sprinkled over with birches, to the village of Sandwyke,
          a few straggling houses, that with the small estates attached to them, occupy an opening
          opposite to Lyulph's Tower and Gowbarrow Park. In Martindale,<note place="foot" resp="author" type="anon">See Page
            125.</note> the road loses sight of the Lake, and leads over a steep hill, bringing you
          again into view of Ullswater. Its lowest reach, four miles in length, is before you; and
          the view terminated by the long ridge of Cross Fell in the distance. Immediately under the
          eye is a deep-indented bay, with a plot of fertile land, traversed by a small brook, and
          rendered cheerful by two or three substantial houses of a more ornamented and showy
          appearance than is usual in those wild spots. </p>
               <p> From Pooley Bridge, at the foot of the Lake, Haweswater may be conveniently visited.
          Haweswater is a lesser Ullswater, with this advantage, that it remains undefiled by the
          intrusion of bad taste. </p>
               <p>
                  <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n062.html">Lowther Castle</ref> is about four miles from Pooley Bridge, and, if
          during this Tour the Stranger has complained, as he will have had reason to do, of a want
          of majestic trees, he may be abundantly recompensed for his loss in the far-spreading
          woods which surround <pb rend="none"/> that mansion. Visitants, for the most part, see little of the
          beauty of these magnificent grounds, being content with the view from the Terrace; but the

            delineation, if tolerably executed, will, in some instances, communicate to the

            to his recollections a more orderly arrangement than his own opportunities of observing
            may have permitted him to make; while it will be still more useful to the future
            traveller, by directing his attention at once to distinctions in things which, without
            such previous aid, a length of time only could enable him to discover. It is hoped,

                  <p>To begin, then, with the main outlines of the country;—I know not how to give the

              <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n067.html">Winandermere</ref>, stretched nearly to the sea; or rather to the
            sands of the vast bay of Morcamb, serving here for the rim of this imaginary
            wheel;—let us trace it in a direction from the south-east towards the south, and
            we shall next fix our eyes upon the vale of Coniston, running up likewise from the sea,
            but not (as all the other vallies do) to the nave of the wheel, and therefore it may be
            not inaptly represented as a broken spoke sticking in the rim. Looking forth again, with
            an inclination towards the west, we see immediately at our feet the vale of Duddon, in
            which is no lake, but a copious stream winding among fields, rocks, and mountains, and
            terminating its course in the sands of Duddon. The fourth vale, next to be observed,
            viz. that of the Esk, is of the same general character as the last, yet beautifully
            discriminated from it by peculiar features. Its stream passes under the woody steep upon
            which stands Muncaster Castle, the ancient seat of the Penningtons, <pb rend="none"/> and after
            forming a short and narrow [ae]stuary enters the sea below the small town of Ravenglass.
            Next, almost due west, look down into, and along the deep valley of Wastdale, with its
            little chapel and half a dozen neat dwellings scattered upon a plain of meadow and
            corn-ground intersected with stone walls apparently innumerable, like a large piece of
            lawless patch-work, or an array of mathematical figures, such as in the ancient schools
            of geometry might have been sportively and fantastically traced out upon sand. Beyond
            this little fertile plain lies, within a bed of steep mountains, the long, narrow,
            stern, and desolate lake of Wastdale; and, beyond this, a dusky tract of level ground
            conducts the eye to the Irish Sea. The stream that issues from Wast-water is named the
            Irt, and falls into the estuary of the river Esk. Next comes in view Ennerdale, with its
            lake of bold and somewhat savage shores. Its stream, the Ehen or Enna, flowing through a
            soft and fertile country, passes the town of Egremont, and the ruins of the
            castle,—then, seeming, like the other rivers, to break through the barrier of sand
            thrown up by the winds on this tempestuous coast, enters the Irish Sea. The vale of
            Buttermere, with the lake and village of that name, and Crummock-water, beyond, next
            present themselves. We will follow the main stream, the Coker, through the fertile and
            beautiful vale of Lorton, till it is lost in the Derwent, below the noble ruins of
            Cocker<!-- - --><pb rend="none"/>mouth Castle. Lastly, Borrowdale, of which the vale of Keswick is only a
            continuation, stretching due north, brings us to a point nearly opposite to the vale of
            Winandermere with which we began. From this it will appear, that the image of a wheel,
            thus far exact, is little more than one half complete; but the deficiency on the eastern
            side may be supplied by the vales of Wytheburn, Ulswater, Hawswater, and the vale of
            Grasmere and Rydal; none of these, however, run up to the central point between Great
            Gavel and Scawfell. From this, hitherto our central point, take a flight of not more
            than four or five miles eastward to the ridge of Helvellyn, and you will look down upon
            Wytheburn and St. John's Vale, which are a branch of the vale of Keswick; upon Ulswater,
            stretching due east:—and not far beyond to the south-east (though from this point
            not visible) lie the vale and lake of Hawswater; and lastly, the vale of Grasmere,
            Rydal, and Ambleside, brings you back to Winandermere, thus completing, though on the
            eastern side in a somewhat irregular manner, the representative figure of the wheel. </p>
                  <p>Such, concisely given, is the general topographical view of the country of the Lakes in
            the north of England; and it may be observed, that, from the circumference to the
            centre, that is, from the sea or plain country to the mountain stations specified, there
            is—in the several ridges that enclose these vales, and divide them from each
            other, I mean in the <pb rend="none"/> forms and surfaces, first of the swelling grounds, next of
            the hills and rocks, and lastly of the mountains—an ascent of almost regular
            gradation, from elegance and richness, to their highest point of grandeur and sublimity.
            It follows therefore from this, first, that these rocks, hills, and mountains, must
            present themselves to view in stages rising above each other, the mountains clustering
            together towards the central point; and next, that an observer familiar with the several
            vales, must, from their various position in relation to the sun, have had before his
            eyes every possible embellishment of beauty, dignity, and splendour, which light and
            shadow can bestow upon objects so diversified. For example, in the vale of Winandermere,
            if the spectator looks for gentle and lovely scenes, his eye is turned towards the
            south; if for the grand, towards the north: in the vale of Keswick, which (as hath been
            said) lies almost due north of this, it is directly the reverse. Hence, when the sun is
            setting in summer far to the north-west, it is seen, by the spectator from the shores or
            breast of Winandermere, resting among the summits of the loftiest mountains, some of
            which will perhaps be half or wholly hidden by clouds, or by the blaze of light which
            the orb diffuses around it; and the surface of the lake will reflect before the eye
            correspondent colours through every variety of beauty, and through all degrees of
            splendour. In the vale of Keswick, at the same period, the sun sets <pb rend="none"/> over the
            humbler regions of the landscape, and showers down upon <emph>them</emph> the
            radiance which at once veils and glorifies,—sending forth, meanwhile, broad
            streams of rosy, crimson, purple, or golden light, towards the grand mountains in the
            south and south-east, which, thus illuminated, with all their projections and cavities,
            and with an intermixture of solemn shadows, are seen distinctly through a cool and clear
            atmosphere. Of course, there is as marked a difference between the <emph>noontide</emph> appearance of these two opposite vales. The bedimming haze that
            overspreads the south, and the clear atmosphere and determined shadows of the clouds in
            the north, at the same time of the day, are each seen in these several vales, with a
            contrast as striking. The reader will easily conceive in what degree the intermediate
            vales partake of a kindred variety. </p>
                  <p>I do not indeed know any tract of country in which, within so narrow a compass, may be
            found an equal variety in the influences of light and shadow upon the sublime or
            beautiful features of landscape; and it is owing to the combined circumstances to which
            the reader's attention has been directed. From a point between Great Gavel and Scawfell,
            a shepherd would not require more than an hour to descend into any one of eight of the
            principal vales by which he would be surrounded; and all the others lie (with the
            exception of Hawswater) at but a small distance. Yet, though clustered together, every
            valley has its distinct <pb rend="none"/> and separate character: in some instances, as if they had
            been formed in studied contrast to each other, and in others with the united pleasing
            differences and resemblances of a sisterly rivalship. This concentration of interest
            gives to the country a decided superiority over the most attractive districts of
            Scotland and Wales, especially for the pedestrian traveller. In Scotland and Wales are
            found, undoubtedly, individual scenes, which, in their several kinds, cannot be
            excelled. But, in Scotland, particularly, what long tracts of desolate country
            intervene! so that the traveller, when he reaches a spot deservedly of great celebrity,
            would find it difficult to determine how much of his pleasure is owing to excellence
            inherent in the landscape itself; and how much to an instantaneous recovery from an
            oppression left upon his spirits by the barrenness and desolation through which he has
            passed. </p>
                  <p>But to proceed with our survey;—and, first, of the MOUNTAINS. Their <emph>forms</emph> are endlessly diversified, sweeping easily or boldly in
            simple majesty, abrupt and precipitous, or soft and elegant. In magnitude and grandeur
            they are individually inferior to the most celebrated of those in some other parts of
            this island; but, in the combinations which they make, towering above each other, or
            lifting themselves in ridges like the waves of a tumultuous sea, and in the beauty and
            variety of their surfaces and colours, they are surpassed by none. </p>
                  <p> The general <emph>surface</emph> of the mountains is <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n068.html">turf, <pb rend="none"/> rendered rich and green by the moisture of the climate. Sometimes the
              turf, as in the neighbourhood of Newlands, is little broken</ref>, the whole covering
            being soft and downy pasturage. In other places rocks predominate; the soil is laid bare
            by torrents and burstings of water from the sides of the mountains in heavy rains; and
            not unfrequently their perpendicular sides are seamed by ravines (formed also by rains
            and torrents) which, meeting in angular points, entrench and scar the surface with
            numerous figures like the letters W. and Y. </p>
                  <p> In the ridge that divides Eskdale from Wasdale, granite is found; but the MOUNTAINS
            are for the most part composed of the stone by mineralogists termed schist, which, as
            you approach the plain country, gives place to limestone and free-stone; but schist
            being the substance of the mountains, the predominant <emph>color</emph> of
            their <emph>rocky</emph> parts is bluish, or hoary grey—the general tint
            of the lichens with which the bare stone is encrusted. With this blue or grey colour is
            frequently intermixed a red tinge, proceeding from the iron that interveins the stone,
            and impregnates the soil. The iron is the principle of decomposition in these rocks; and
            hence, when they become pulverized, the elementary particles crumbling down, overspread
            in many places the steep and almost precipitous sides of the mountains with an
            intermixture of colours, <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n069.html">like the compound hues of a dove's
              neck</ref>. When in the heat of advancing summer, the fresh green <pb rend="none"/> tint of the
            herbage has somewhat faded, it is again revived by the appearance of the fern profusely
            spread over the same ground: and, upon this plant, more than upon any thing else, do the
            changes which the seasons make in the <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n070.html">colouring of the mountains
              depend. About the first week in October</ref>, the rich green, which prevailed through
            the whole summer, is usually passed away. The brilliant and various colours of the fern
            are then in harmony with the autumnal woods; bright yellow or lemon colour, at the base
            of the mountains, melting gradually, through orange, to a dark russet brown towards the
            summits, where the plant, being more exposed to the weather, is in a more advanced state
            of decay. Neither heath nor furze are <emph>generally</emph> found upon the
              <emph>sides</emph> of these mountains, though in many places they are
            adorned by those plants, so beautiful when in flower. We may add, that the mountains are
            of height sufficient to have the surface towards the summit softened by distance, and to
            imbibe the finest aerial hues. In common also with other mountains, their apparent forms
            and colours are perpetually changed by the clouds and vapours which float round them:
            the effect indeed of mist or haze, in a country of this character, is like that of
            magic. I have seen six or seven ridges rising above each other, all created in a moment
            by the vapours upon the side of a mountain, which, in its ordinary appearance, shewed
            not a projecting point to furnish even a hint for such an operation. <pb rend="none"/>
                  </p>
                  <p> I will take this opportunity of observing, that they who have studied the appearances
            of nature feel that the superiority, in point of visual interest, of mountainous over
            other countries— is more strikingly displayed in winter than in summer. This, as
            must be obvious, is partly owing to the <emph>forms</emph> of the mountains,
            which, of course, are not affected by the seasons; but also, in no small degree, to the
            greater variety that exists in their <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n071.html">winter than their summer <emph>colouring</emph>
                     </ref>. This variety is such, and so harmoniously
            preserved, that it leaves little cause of regret when the splendour of autumn is passed
            away. The oak-coppices, upon the sides of the mountains, retain russet leaves; the
            birch stands conspicuous with its silver stem and puce-coloured twigs; the hollies, with
            green leaves and scarlet berries, have come forth to view from among the deciduous
            trees, whose summer foliage had concealed them: the ivy is now plentifully apparent upon
            the stems and boughs of the trees, and upon the steep rocks. In place of the deep
            summer-green of the herbage and fern, many rich colours play into each other over the
            surface of the mountains; turf (the tints of which are interchangeably tawny-green,
            olive, and brown,) beds of withered fern, and grey rocks, being harmoniously blended
            together. The mosses and lichens are never so fresh and flourishing as in winter, if it
            be not a season of frost; and their minute beauties prodigally adorn the foreground.
            Wherever we turn, we find these <pb rend="none"/> productions of nature, to which winter is rather
            favourable than unkindly, scattered over the walls, banks of earth, rocks, and stones,
            and upon the trunks of trees, with the intermixture of several species of small fern,
            now green and fresh; and, to the observing passenger, their forms and colours are a
            source of inexhaustable admiration. Add to this the hoar-frost and snow, with all the
            varieties they create, and which volumes would not be sufficient to describe. I will
            content myself with one instance of the colouring produced by snow, which may not be
            uninteresting to painters. It is <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n072.html">extracted from the memorandum-book
              of a friend</ref>; and for its accuracy I can speak, having been an eye-witness of
            the appearance. "I observed," says he, "the beautiful effect of the
            drifted snow upon the mountains, and the perfect <emph>tone</emph> of colour.
            From the top of the mountains downwards a rich olive was produced by the powdery snow
            and the grass, which olive was warmed with a little brown, and in this way harmoniously
            combined, by insensible gradations, with the white. The drifting took away the monotony
            of snow; and the whole vale of Grasmere, seen from the terrace walk in Easedale, was as
            varied, perhaps more so, than even in the pomp of autumn. In the distance was
            Loughrigg-Fell, the basin-wall of the lake: this, from the summit downward, was a rich
            orange-olive; then the lake of a bright olive-green, nearly the same tint as the
            snow-powdered mountain <pb rend="none"/> tops and high slopes in Easedale; and lastly, the church,
            with its firs, forming the centre of the view. Next to the church came nine
            distinguishable hills, six of them with woody sides turned towards us, all of them
            oak-copses with their bright red leaves and snow-powdered twigs; these hills—so
            variously situated in relation to each other, and to the view in general, so variously
            powdered, some only enough to give the herbage a rich brown tint, one intensely white
            and lighting up all the others —were yet so placed, as in the most inobtrusive
            manner to harmonise by contrast with a perfect naked, snowless bleak summit in the far
            distance." </p>
                  <p> Having spoken of the forms, surface, and colour of the mountains, let us descend into
            the VALES. Though these have been represented under the general image of the spokes of a
            wheel, they are, for the most part, winding; the windings of many being abrupt and
            intricate. And, it may be observed, that, in one circumstance, the general shape of them
            all has been determined by that primitive conformation through which so many became
            receptacles of lakes. For they are not formed, as are most of the celebrated Welsh
            vallies, by an approximation of the sloping bases of the opposite mountains towards each
            other, leaving little more between than a channel for the passage of a hasty river; but
            the bottom of these vallies is mostly a spacious and gently declining area, apparently
            level as the floor <pb rend="none"/> of a temple, or the surface of a lake, and broken in many
            cases, by rocks and hills, which rise up like islands from the plain. In such of the
            vallies as make many windings, these level areas open upon the traveller in succession,
            divided from each other sometimes by a mutual approximation of the hills, leaving only
            passage for a river, sometimes by correspondent windings, without such approximation;
            and sometimes by a bold advance, of one mountain towards that which is opposite it. It
            may here be observed with propriety that the several rocks and hills, which have been
            described as rising up like islands from the level area of the vale, have regulated the
            choice of the inhabitants in the situation of their dwellings. Where none of these are
            found, and the inclination of the ground is not sufficiently rapid easily to carry off
            the waters, (as in the higher part of Langdale, for instance,) the houses are not
            sprinkled over the middle of the vales, but confined to their sides, being placed merely
            so far up the mountain as to be protected from the floods. But where these rocks and
            hills have been scattered over the plain of the vale, (as in Grasmere, Donnerdale,
            Eskdale, &amp;.) the beauty which they give to the scene is much heightened by a single
            cottage, or cluster of cottages, that will be almost always found under them, or upon
            their sides; dryness and shelter having tempted the Dalesmen to fix their habitations
            there. <pb rend="none"/>
                  </p>
                  <p> I shall now speak of the LAKES of this country. The form of the lake is most perfect
            when, like Derwent-water, and some of the smaller lakes, it least resembles that of a
            river; —I mean, when being looked at from any given point where the whole may be
            seen at once, the width of it bears such proportion to the length, that, however the
            outline may be diversified by far-receding bays, it never assumes the shape of a river,
            and is contemplated with that placid and quiet feeling which belongs peculiarly to the
            lake—as a body of still water under the influence of no current; reflecting
            therefore the clouds, the light, and all the imagery of the sky and surrounding hills;
            expressing also and making visible the changes of the atmosphere, and motions of the
            lightest breeze, and subject to agitation only from the winds—</p>

                  </quote>
                  <p>It must be noticed, as a favourable characteristic of the lakes of this country, that,
            though several of the largest, such as Winandermere, Ulswater, Haweswater, do, when the
            whole length of them is commanded from an elevated point, lose somewhat of the peculiar
            form of the lake, and assume the resemblance of a magnificent river; yet, as their shape
            is winding, <pb rend="none"/> (particularly that of Ulswater and Hawswater) when the view of the
            whole is obstructed by those barriers which determine the windings, and the spectator is
            confined to one reach, the appropriate feeling is revived; and one lake may thus in
            succession present to the eye the essential characteristic of many. But, though the
            forms of the large lakes have this advantage, it is nevertheless favourable to the
            beauty of the country that the largest of them are comparatively small; and that the
            same vale generally furnishes a succession of lakes, instead of being filled with one.
            The vales in North Wales, as hath been observed, are not formed for the reception of
            lakes; those of Switzerland, Scotland, and this part of the North of England, <emph>are</emph> so formed; but, in Switzerland and Scotland, the proportion of
            diffused water is often too great, as at the lake of Geneva for instance, and in most of
            the Scotch lakes. No doubt it sounds magnificent and flatters the imagination, to hear
            at a distance of expanses of water so many leagues in length and miles in width; and
            such ample room may be delightful to the fresh-water sailor, scudding with a lively
            breeze amid the rapidly-shifting scenery. But, who ever travelled along the banks of
            Loch-Lomond, variegated as the lower part is by islands, without feeling that a
            speedier termination of the long vista of blank water would be acceptable; and without
            wishing for an interposition of green meadows, trees, and cottages, and a sparkling
            <pb rend="none"/> stream to run by his side? In fact, a notion, of grandeur, as connected with
            magnitude, has seduced persons of taste into a general mistake upon this subject. It is
            much more desirable, for the purposes of pleasure, that lakes should be numerous, and
            small or middlesized, than large, not only for communication by walks and rides, but for
            variety, and for recurrence of similar appearances. To illustrate this by one
            instance:—how pleasing is it to have a ready and frequent opportunity of watching,
            at the outlet of a lake, the stream pushing its way among the rocks in lively contrast
            with the stillness from which it has escaped; and how amusing to compare its noisy and
            turbulent motions with the gentle playfulness of the breezes, that may be starting up or
            wandering here and there over the faintly-rippled surface of the broad water! I may add,
            as a general remark, that, in lakes of great width, the shores cannot be distinctly seen
            at the same time, and therefore contribute little to mutual illustration and ornament;
            and, if the opposite shores are out of sight of each other, like those of the American
            and Asiatic lakes, then unfortunately the traveller is reminded of a nobler object; he
            has the blankness of a sea-prospect without the grandeur and accompanying sense of
            power. </p>
                  <p> As the comparatively small size of the lakes in the North of England is favourable to
            the production of variegated landscape, their <emph>boundary-line</emph> also
            is for the most part gracefully <pb rend="none"/> or boldly indented. That uniformity which prevails
            in the primitive frame of the lower grounds among all chains or clusters of mountains
            where large bodies of still water are bedded, is broken by the <emph>secondary</emph> agents of nature, ever at work to supply the deficiences of the mould
            in which things were originally cast. Using the word <emph>deficiences</emph>, I do not speak with reference to those stronger emotions which a
            region of mountains is peculiarly fitted to excite. The bases of those huge barriers may
            run for a long space in straight lines, and these parallel to each other; the opposite
            sides of a profound vale may ascend as exact counterparts, or in mutual reflection, like
            the billows of a troubled sea; and the impression be, from its very simplicity, more
            awful and sublime. Sublimity is the result of Nature's first great dealings with the
            superficies of the earth; but the general tendency of her subsequent operations is
            towards the production of beauty; by a multiplicity of symmetrical parts uniting in a
            consistent whole. This is every where exemplified along the margins of these lakes.
            Masses of rock, that have been precipitated from the heights into the area of waters,
            lie in some places like stranded ships; or have acquired the compact structure of
            jutting piers; or project in little peninsulas crested with native wood. The smallest
            rivulet—one whose silent influx is scarcely noticeable in a season of dry
            weather—so faint is the dimple made by it on the surface of the smooth
            lake—will <pb rend="none"/> be found to have been not useless in shaping, by its deposits of
            gravel and soil in time of flood, a curve that would not otherwise have existed. But the
            more powerful brooks, encroaching upon the level of the lake, have, in course of time,
            given birth to ample promontories of sweeping outline that contrast boldly with the
            longitudinal base of the steeps on the opposite shore; while their flat or gently
            sloping surfaces never fail to introduce, into the midst of desolation and barrenness,
            the elements of fertility, even where the habitations of men may not have been raised.
            These alluvial promontories, however, threaten, in some places, to bisect the waters
            which they have long adorned; and, in course of ages, they will cause some of the lakes
            to dwindle into numerous and insignificant pools; which, in their turn, will finally be
            filled up. But, checking these intrusive calculations, let us rather be content with
            appearances as they are, and pursue in imagination the meandering shores, whether rugged
            steeps, admitting of no cultivation, descend into the water; or gently-sloping lawns and
            woods, or flat and fertile meadows stretch between the margin of the lake and the
            mountains. Among minuter recommendations will be noticed, especially along bays exposed
            to the setting-in of strong-winds, the curved rim of fine blue gravel, thrown up in
            course of time by the waves, half of it perhaps gleaming from under the water, and the
            corresponding half of a lighter <pb rend="none"/> hue; and in other parts bordering the lake,
            groves, if I may so call them, of reeds and bulrushes; or plots of water-lilies lifting
            up their large target-shaped leaves to the breeze, while the white flower is heaving
            upon the wave. </p>
                  <p> To these may naturally be added the birds that enliven the waters. Wild-ducks in
            springtime hatch their young in the islands, and upon reedy shores;— the
            sand-piper, flitting along the stony margins, by its restless note attracts the eye to
            motions as restless:—upon some jutting rock, or at the edge of a smooth meadow,
            the stately heron may be descried with folded wings, that might seem to have caught
            their delicate hue from the blue waters, by the side of which she watches for her
            sustenance. In winter, the lakes are sometimes resorted to by wild swans; and in that
            season habitually by <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n074.html">widgeons, goldings</ref>, and other aquatic
            fowl of the smaller species. Let me be allowed the aid of verse to describe the
            evolutions which these visitants sometimes perform, on a fine day towards the close of
            winter. </p>

                  <p> The ISLANDS, dispersed among these lakes, are neither so numerous nor so beautiful as
            might be expected from the account that has been given of the manner in which the level
            areas of the vales are so frequently diversified by rocks, hills, and hillocks,
            scattered over them; nor are they ornamented (as are several of the lakes in Scotland
            and Ireland) by the remains of castles or other places of defence; nor with the still
            more interesting ruins of religious edifices. Every one must regret that scarcely a
            vestige is left of the <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n076.html">Oratory, consecrated to the Virgin, which
              stood upon Chapel-Holm in Windermere, and that the Chauntry has disappeared, where

            if the wood upon them were managed with more taste, they might become interesting

            worth while here to mention (not as an object of beauty, but of curiosity) that there
            occasionally appears above the surface of Derwentwater, and always in the same place, a
            considerable tract of spongy ground covered with aquatic plants, which is called <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n078.html">the Floating, but with more propriety might be named the Buoyant,

           This part of the subject may be concluded with observing—that, from the
            multitude of brooks and torrents that fall into these lakes, and of internal springs by
            which they are fed, and which circulate through them like veins, they are truly living
            lakes, <emph>"<ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n081.html">vivi lacus</ref>;"</emph> and are
            thus discriminated from the stagnant and sullen pools frequent among mountains that have
            been formed by volcanoes, and from the shallow meres found in flat and fenny countries.
            The water is also of crystalline purity; so that, if it were not for the reflections of
            the incumbent mountains by which it is darkened, a delusion might be felt, by a person
            resting quietly in a boat on the bosom of Winandermere or Derwent-water, similar to that
            which <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n082.html">Carver so beautifully describes</ref> when he was floating
            alone in the middle of lake Erie or Ontario, and could almost have imagined that his
            boat was suspended in an element as pure as air, or rather that the air and water were
            one. </p>
                  <p> Having spoken of Lakes I must not omit to mention, as a kindred feature of this
            country, those bodies of still water called TARNS. In the economy of nature these are
            useful, as auxiliars to Lakes; for if the whole quantity of water which falls upon the
            mountains in time of storm were poured down upon the plains without intervention, in
            some quarters, of such receptacles, the habitable grounds would be much more subject
            than they are to inundation. But, as some of the collateral <pb rend="none"/> brooks spend their
            fury, finding a free course toward and also down the channel of the main stream of the
            vale before those that have to pass through the higher tarns and lakes have filled their
            several basins, a gradual distribution is effected; and the waters thus reserved,
            instead of uniting, to spread ravage and deformity, with those which meet with no such
            detention, contribute to support, for a length of time, the vigour of many streams
            without a fresh fall of rain. Tarns are found in some of the vales, and are numerous
            upon the mountains. A Tarn, in a <emph>Vale</emph>, implies, for the most
            part, that the bed of the vale is not happily formed; that the water of the brooks can
            neither wholly escape, nor diffuse itself over a large area. Accordingly, in such
            situations, Tarns are often surrounded by an unsightly tract of boggy ground; but this
            is not always the case, and in the cultivated parts of the country, when the shores of
            the Tarn are determined, it differs only from the Lake in being smaller, and in
            belonging mostly to a smaller valley, or circular recess. Of this class of miniature
            lakes, Loughrigg Tarn, near Grasmere, is the most beautiful example. It has a margin of
            green firm meadows, of rocks, and rocky woods, a few reeds here, a little company of
            water-lilies there, with beds of gravel or stone beyond; a tiny stream issuing neither
            briskly nor sluggishly out of it; but its feeding rills, from the shortness of their
            course, so small as to be scarcely visible. Five <pb rend="none"/> or six cottages are reflected in
            its peaceful bosom; rocky and barren steeps rise up above the hanging enclosures; and
            the solemn pikes of Langdale overlook, from a distance, the low cultivated ridge of land
            that forms the northern boundary of this small, quiet, and fertile domain. The <emph>mountain</emph> Tarns can only be recommended to the notice of the
            inquisitive traveller who has time to spare. They are difficult of access and naked; yet
            some of them are, in their permanent forms, very grand; and there are accidents of
            things which would make the meanest of them interesting. At all events, one of these
            pools is an acceptable sight to the mountain wanderer; not merely as an incident that
            diversifies the prospect, but as forming in his mind a centre or conspicuous point to
            which objects, otherwise disconnected or insubordinated, may be referred. Some few have
            a varied outline, with bold heath-clad promontories; and, as they mostly lie at the foot
            of a steep precipice, the water where the sun is not shining upon it, appears black and
            sullen; and, round the margin, huge stones and masses of rock are scattered; some
            defying conjecture as to the means by which they came thither; and others obviously
            fallen from on high—the contribution of ages! A not unpleasing sadness is induced
            by this perplexity, and these images of decay; while the prospect of a body of pure
            water unattended with groves and other cheerful rural images by which fresh water is
            usually <pb rend="none"/> accompanied, and unable to give furtherance to the meagre vegetation
            around it—excites a sense of some repulsive power strongly put forth, and thus
            deepens the melancholy natural to such scenes. Nor is the feeling of solitude often more
            forcibly or more solemnly impressed than by the side of one of these mountain pools:
            though desolate and forbidding, it seems a distinct place to repair to; yet where the
            visitants must be rare, and there can be no disturbance. Water-fowl flock hither; and
            the lonely Angler may here be seen; but the imagination, not content with this scanty
            allowance of society, is tempted to attribute a voluntary power to every change which
            takes place in such a spot, whether it be the breeze that wanders over the surface of
            the water, or the splendid lights of evening resting upon it in the midst of awful
            precipices.</p>

                  <p>It will be observed that this country is bounded on the south and east by the sea,
            which combines beautifully, from many elevated points, with the inland scenery; and,
            from the bay of Morcamb, the sloping shores and back-ground of distant mountains are
            seen, <pb rend="none"/> composing pictures equally distinguished for amenity and grandeur. But the
            [ae]stuaries on this coast are in a great measure bare at low water<note resp="author" place="foot">In fact there is not an instance of a harbour on the Cumberland side of
              the Solway frith that is not dry at low water; that of Ravenglass, at the mouth of the
              Esk, as a natural harbour is much the best. The Sea appears to have been retiring
              slowly for ages from this coast. from Whitehaven to St. Bees extends a track of level
              ground, about five miles in length, which formerly must have been under salt water, so
              as to have made an island of the high ground that stretches between it and the
              Sea.</note>; and there is no instance of the sea running far up among the mountains,
            and mingling with the Lakes, which are such in the strict and usual sense of the word,
            being of fresh water. Nor have the streams, from the shortness of their course, time to
            acquire that body of water necessary to confer upon them much majesty. In fact, the most
            considerable, while they continue in the mountain and lake-country, are rather large
            brooks than rivers. The water is perfectly pellucid, through which in many places are
            seen, to a great depth, their beds of rock, or of blue gravel, which give to the water
            itself an exquisitely cerulean colour: this is particularly striking in the rivers
            Derwent and Duddon, which may be compared, such and so various are their beauties, to
            any two rivers of equal length of course in any country. The number of the torrents and
            smaller brooks is infinite, with their water-falls and water-breaks; and they need not
            here be described. I will only ob<!-- - --><pb rend="none"/>serve that, as many, even of the smallest
            rills, have either found, or made for themselves, recesses in the sides of the mountains
            or in the vales, they have tempted the primitive inhabitants to settle near them for
            shelter; and hence, cottages so placed, by seeming to withdraw from the eye, are the
            more endeared to the feelings. </p>
                  <p> The WOODS consist chiefly of oak, ash, and birch, and here and there Wych-elm, with
            underwood of hazle, the white and black thorn, and hollies; in moist places alders and
            willows abound; and yews among the rocks. Formerly the whole country must have been

            the country formerly had, yet survive in the native coppice-woods that have been
            protected by inclosures, and also in the forest-trees and hollies, which, though
            disappearing fast, are yet <pb rend="none"/> scattered both over the inclosed and uninclosed parts
            of the mountains. The same is expressed by the beauty and intricacy with which the
            fields and coppice-woods are often intermingled: the plough of the first settlers having
            followed naturally the veins of richer, dryer, or less stony soil; and thus it has
            shaped out an intermixture of wood and lawn, with a grace and wildness which it would
            have been impossible for the hand of studied art to produce. Other trees have been
            introduced within these last fifty years, such as beeches, larches, limes, &amp;, and
            plantations of firs, seldom with advantage, and often with great injury to the
            appearance of the country; but the sycamore (which I believe was brought into this
            island from Germany, not more than two hundred years ago) has long been the favourite of
            the cottagers; and, with the fir, has been chosen to screen their dwellings: and is
            sometimes found in the fields whither the winds or the waters may have carried its
            seeds. </p>
                  <p> The want most felt, however, is that of timber trees. There are a few <emph>magnificent</emph> ones to be found near any of the lakes; and unless
            greater care be taken, there will, in a short time, scarcely be left an ancient oak that
            would repay the cost of felling. The neighbourhood of Rydal, notwithstanding the havoc
            which has been made, is yet nobly distinguished. In the woods of Lowther, also, is found
            an almost matchless store of ancient trees, and the majesty and wildness of the native
            forest. <pb rend="none"/>
                  </p>
                  <p> Among the smaller vegetable ornaments must be reckoned <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n084.html">the
              bilberry</ref>, a ground plant, never so beautiful as in early spring, when it is seen
            under bare or budding trees, that imperfectly intercept the sun-shine, covering the
            rocky knolls with a pure mantle of fresh verdure, more lively than the herbage of the
            open fields;—<ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n085.html">the broom</ref> that spreads luxuriantly along
            rough pastures, and in the month of June interveins the steep copses with its golden
            blossoms;—and the juniper, a rich evergreen, that thrives in spite of cattle, upon
            the uninclosed parts of the mountains:—the Dutch myrtle diffuses fragrance in
            moist places; and there is an endless variety of brilliant flowers in the fields and
            meadows, which, if the agriculture of the country were more carefully attended to, would
            disappear. Nor can I omit again to notice the lichens and mosses: their profusion,
            beauty, and variety exceed those of any other country I have seen. </p>
                  <p> It may now be proper to say a few words respecting climate, and “<ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n086.html">skiey influences</ref>,” in which this region, as far as the character of its
            landscapes is affected by them, may, upon the whole, be considered fortunate. The
            country is, indeed, subject to much bad weather, and it has been ascertained that <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n087.html">twice as much rain falls here as in many parts of the island</ref>; but
            the number of black drizzling days, that blot out the face of things, is by no means <emph>proportionally</emph> great. Nor is a continuance of thick, flagging,
            damp air so common as in the West <pb rend="none"/> of England and Ireland. The rain here comes down
            heartily, and is frequently succeeded by clear, bright weather, when every brook is
            vocal, and every torrent sonorous; brooks and torrents, which are never muddy, even in
            the heaviest floods, except, after a drought, they happen to be defiled for a short time
            by waters that have swept along dusty roads, or have broken out into ploughed fields.
            Days of unsettled weather, with partial showers, are very frequent; but the showers,
            darkening, or brightening, as they fly from hill to hill, are not less grateful to the
            eye than finely interwoven passages of gay and sad music are touching to the ear.
            Vapours exhaling from the lakes and meadows after sun-rise, in a hot season, or, in
            moist weather, brooding upon the heights, or descending towards the valleys with
            inaudible motion, give a visionary character to every thing around them; and are in
            themselves so beautiful, as to dispose us to enter into the feelings of those simple
            nations (such as the Laplanders of this day) by whom they are taken for guardian deities
            of the mountains; or to sympathize with others who have fancied these delicate
            apparitions to be the spirits of their departed ancestors. Akin to these are fleecy
            clouds resting upon the hill-tops; they are not easily managed in picture, with their
            accompaniments of blue sky; but how glorious are they in nature! how pregnant with
            imagination for the poet! and the height of the Cumbrian mountains is sufficient to
            exhibit <pb rend="none"/> daily and hourly instances of those mysterious attachments. Such clouds,
            cleaving to their stations, or lifting up suddenly their glittering heads from behind
            rocky barriers, or hurrying out of sight with speed of the sharpest edge—will
            often tempt an inhabitant to congratulate himself on belonging to a country of mists and
            clouds and storms, and make him think of the blank sky of Egypt, and of the cerulean
            vacancy of Italy, as an unanimated and even a sad spectacle. The atmosphere, however, as
            in every country subject to much rain, is frequently unfavourable to landscape,
            especially when keen winds succeed the rain which are apt to produce coldness,
            spottiness, and an unmeaning or repulsive detail in the distance;—a sunless frost,
            under a canopy of leaden and shapeless clouds, is, as far as it allows things to be
            seen, equally disagreeable. </p>
                  <p> It <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n088.html">has been said that in human life there are moments worth
              ages</ref>. In a more subdued tone of sympathy may we affirm, that in the climate of
            England there are, for the lover of nature, days which are worth whole months, —I
            might say—even years. One of these favoured days sometimes occurs in spring-time,
            when that soft air is breathing over the blossoms and new-born verdure, which inspired
              <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n089.html">Buchanan with his beautiful Ode to the first of May</ref>; the
            air, which, in the luxuriance of his fancy, he likens to that of the golden age,
            —to that which gives motion to the funereal cypresses on the banks of
            Lethe;—to the air <pb rend="none"/> which is to salute beatified spirits when expiatory fires
            shall have consumed the earth with all her habitations. But it is in autumn that days of
            such affecting influence most frequently intervene;—the atmosphere seems refined,
            and the sky rendered more crystalline, as the vivifying heat of the year abates; the
            lights and shadows are more delicate; the colouring is richer and more finely
            harmonized; and, in this season of stillness, the ear being unoccupied, or only gently
            excited, the sense of vision becomes more susceptible of its appropriate enjoyments. A
            resident in a country like this which we are treating of, will agree with me, that the
            presence of a lake is indispensable to exhibit in perfection the beauty of one of these
            days; and he must have experienced, while looking on the unruffled waters, that the
            imagination, by their aid, is carried into recesses of feeling otherwise impenetrable.
            The reason of this is, that the heavens are not only brought down into the bosom of the
            earth, but that the earth is mainly looked at, and thought of, through the medium of a
            purer element. The happiest times is when the equinoxial gales are departed; but their
            fury may probably be called to mind by the sight of a few shattered boughs, whose leaves
            do not differ in colour from the faded foliage of the stately oaks from which these
            relics of the storm depend: all else speaks of tranquillity;—not a breath of air,
            no restlessness of insects, and not a moving object perceptible— <pb rend="none"/> except the
            clouds gliding in the depths of the lake, or the traveller passing along, an inverted
            image, whose motion seems governed by the quiet of a time, to which its archetype, the
            living person, is, perhaps, insensible:— or it may happen, that the figure of one
            of the larger birds, a raven or a heron, is crossing silently among the reflected
            clouds, while the voice of the real bird, from the element aloft, gently awakens in the
            spectator the recollection of appetites and instincts, pursuits and occupations, that
            deform and agitate the world, —yet have no power to prevent Nature from putting on
            an aspect capable of satisfying the most intense cravings for the tranquil, the lovely,
            and the perfect, to which man, the noblest of her creatures, is subject. </p>
                  <p>Thus far, of climate, as influencing the feelings through its effect on the objects of
            sense. We may add, that whatever has been said upon the advantages derived to these
            scenes from a changeable atmosphere, would apply, perhaps still more forcibly, to their
            appearance under the varied solemnities of night. <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n090.html">Milton, it will be
              remembered, has given a <emph>clouded</emph> moon to Paradise itself</ref>.
            In the night-season also, the narrowness of the vales, and comparative smallness of the
            lakes, are especially adapted to bring surrounding objects home to the eye and to the
            heart. The stars, taking their stations above the hill-tops, are contemplated from a
            spot <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n091.html">like the Abyssinian recess of Rasselas</ref>, with much more
            touching inter<!-- - --><pb rend="none"/>est than they are likely to excite when looked at from an open
            country with ordinary undulations: and it must be obvious, that it is the <emph>bays</emph> only of large lakes that can present such contrasts of light
            and shadow as those of smaller dimensions display from every quarter. A deep contracted
            valley, with diffused waters, such a valley and plains level and wide as those of
            Chaldea, are the two extremes in which the beauty of the heavens and their connexion
            with the earth are most sensibly felt. Nor do the advantages I have been speaking of
            imply here an exclusion of the aerial effects of distance. These are insured by the
            height of the mountains, and are found, even in the narrowest vales, where they lengthen
            in perspective, or act (if the expression may be used) as telescopes for the open
            country. </p>
                  <anchor xml:id="para53"/>
                  <p>The subject would bear to be enlarged upon: but I will conclude this section with a
            nightscene suggested by the Vale of Keswick. The Fragment is well known; but it
            gratifies me to insert it, as the Writer was one of the first who led the way to a

                              <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n092.html">Dr. Brown</ref>, the author of this fragment, was from his infancy
                brought up in Cumberland, and should have remembered that the practice of folding
                sheep by night is unknown among these mountains, and that the image of the Shepherd
                upon the watch is out of its place, and belongs only to countries, with a warmer
                climate, that are subject to ravages from beasts of prey. It is pleasing to notice a
                dawn of imaginative feeling in these verses. Tickel, a man of no common genius,
                chose, for the subject of a Poem, Kensington Gardens, in preference to the Banks of
                the Derwent, within a mile or two of which he was born. But this was in the reign of
                Queen Anne, or George the first. Progress must have been made in the interval;
                though the traces of it, except in the works of Thomson and Dyer, are not very

                  <p> Hitherto I have chiefly spoken of the features by which nature has discriminated this
            country from others. I will now describe, in general terms, in what manner it is
            indebted to the hand of man. What I have to notice on this subject will emanate most
            easily and perspicuously from a description of the ancient and present inhabitants,
            their occupations, their condition of life, the distribution of landed property among
            them, and the tenure by which it is holden. </p>
                  <p> The reader will suffer me here to recall to his mind the shapes of the vallies, and
            their position with respect to each other, and the forms and substance of the
            intervening mountains. He will people the vallies with lakes and rivers: the coves and
            sides of the mountains with pools and torrents; and will bound half of the circle which
            we have contemplated by the sands of the sea, or by the sea itself. He will conceive
            that, from the point upon which he stood, he looks down upon this scene before the
            country had been penetrated by any inhabitants:—to vary his sensations, and to
            break in upon their stillness, he will form <pb rend="none"/> to himself an image of the tides
            visiting and re-visiting the friths, the main sea dashing against the bolder shore, the
            rivers pursuing their course to be lost in the mighty mass of waters. He may see or hear
            in fancy the winds sweeping over the lakes, or piping with a loud voice among the
            mountain peaks; and, lastly, may think of the primeval woods shedding and renewing their
            leaves with no human eye to notice, or human heart to regret or welcome the change.
              "<ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n093.html">When the first settlers entered this region (says an
                animated writer)</ref> they found it overspread with wood; forest trees, the fir, the oak,
              the ash, and the birch had skirted the fells, tufted the hills, and shaded the
              vallies, through centuries of silent solitude; the birds and beasts of prey reigned
              over the meeker species; and the <emph>bellum inter omnia</emph> maintained
              the balance of nature in the empire of beasts."</p>
                  <p> Such was the state and appearance of this region when the aboriginal colonists of the
            Celtic tribes were first driven or drawn towards it, and became joint tenants with the
            wolf, the boar, the wild bull, the red deer, and the leigh, a gigantic species of deer
            which has been long extinct; while the inaccessible crags were occupied by the falcon,
            the raven, and the eagle. The inner parts were too secluded, and of too little value, to
            participate much of the benefit of Roman manners; and though these conquerors encouraged
            the Britons to the improvement of their lands in the plain country <pb rend="none"/> of Furness and
            Cumberland, they seem to have had little connexion with the mountains, except for
            military purposes, or in subservience to the profit they drew from the mines.</p>
                  <p> When the Romans retired from Great Britain, it is well known that these
            mountainfastnesses furnished a protection to some unsubdued Britons, long after the more
            accessible and more fertile districts had been seized by the Saxon or Danish invader. A
            few, though distinct, traces of Roman forts or camps, as at Ambleside, and upon
            Dunmallet, and a few circles of rude stones attributed to the Druids,<note resp="author" place="foot"> It is not improbable that these circles were once numerous, and that
              many of them yet endure in a perfect state, under no very deep covering of soil. A

                ground, not far from the banks of the Emont</ref>, but in no connection with that
              river, met with some stones which seemed to him formally arranged; this excited his
              curiosity, and preceding, he uncovered a perfect circle of stones, from two or three
              or four feet high, with a <emph>sanctum sanctorum,</emph>—the whole a
              complete place of Druidical worship of small dimensions, having the same sort of
              relation to Stonehenge, Long Meg and her Daughters near the river Eden, and Karl Lofts
              near Shap (if this last be not Danish), that a rural chapel bears to a stately church,
              or to one of our noble cathedrals. This interesting little monument having passed,
              with the field in which it was found, into other hands, has been destroyed. It is much
              to be regretted, that the striking relic of antiquity at Shap has been in a great
              measure destroyed also. <p rend="noCount">

                     </note> are the <pb rend="none"/> only vestiges that remain upon the surface of the country, of
            these ancient occupants; and, as the Saxons and Danes, who succeeded to the possession
            of the villages and hamlets which had been established by the Britons, seem at first to
            have confined themselves to the open country,—we may descend at once to times long
            posterior to the conquest by the Normans, when their feudal polity was regularly
            established. We may easily conceive that these narrow dales and mountain sides, <pb rend="none"/>
            choked up as they must have been with wood, lying out of the way of communication with
            other parts of the Island, and upon the edge of a hostile kingdom, could have little
            attraction for the high-born and powerful; especially as the more open parts of the
            country furnished positions for castles and houses of defence, sufficient to repel any
            of those sudden attacks, which, in the then rude state of military knowledge, could be
            made upon them. Accordingly, the more retired regions (and to such I am now confining
            myself) must have been neglected or shunned even by the persons whose baronial or
            signioral rights extended over them, and left, doubtless, partly as a place of refuge
            for outlaws and robbers, and partly granted out for the more settled habitation of a few
            vassals following the employment of shepherds or woodlanders. Hence these lakes and
            inner vallies are unadorned by any <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n097.html">remains of ancient grandeur,
              castles, or monastic edifices</ref>, which are only found upon the skirts of the
            country, as Furness Abbey, Calder Abbey, the Priory of Lannercost, Gleaston
            Castle,—long ago a residence of the Flemings,—and the numerous ancient
            castles of the Cliffords, the Lucys, and the Dacres. On the southern side of these
            mountains, (especially in that part known by the name of Furness Fells, which is more
            remote from the borders,) the state of society would necessarily be more settled; though
            it also was fashioned, not a little, by its neighbourhood to a hostile king<!-- - --><pb rend="none"/>dom.
            We will, therefore, give a sketch of the economy of the Abbots in the distribution of
            lands among their tenants, as similar plans were doubtless adopted by other Lords, and
            as the consequences have affected the face of the country materially to the present day,
            being, in fact, one of the principal causes which give it such a striking superiority,
            in beauty and interest, over all other parts of the island. </p>
                  <p> "When the Abbots of Furness," says<ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n098.html"> an author before
              cited</ref>, "enfranchised their villains, and raised them to the dignity of
            customary tenants, the lands, which they had cultivated for their lord, were divided
            into whole tenements; each of which, besides the customary annual rent, was charged with
            the obligation of having in readiness a man completely armed for the king's service on
            the borders, or elsewhere; each of these whole tenements was again subdivided into four
            equal parts; each villain had one; and the party tenant contributed his share to the
            support of the man of arms, and of other burdens. These divisions were not properly
            distinguished; the land remained mixed; each tenant had a share through all the arable
            and meadow-land, and common of pasture over all the wastes. These sub-tenements were
            judged sufficient for the support of so many families; and no further division was
            permitted. These divisions and and sub-divisions were convenient at the time for which
            they were calculated: the land, so <pb rend="none"/> parcelled out, was of necessity more attended
            to, and the industry greater, when more persons were to be supported by the produce of
            it. The frontier of the kingdom, within which Furness was considered, was in a constant
            state of attack and defence; more hands, therefore, were necessary to guard the coast,
            to repel an invasion from Scotland, or make reprisals on the hostile neighbour. The
            dividing the lands in such manner as has been shown, increased the number of
            inhabitants, and kept them at home till called for: and, the land being mixed, and the
            several tenants united in equipping the plough, the absence of the fourth man was no
            prejudice to the cultivation of his land, which was committed to the care of three. </p>
                  <p> "While the villains of Low Furness were thus distributed over the land, and
            employed in agriculture; those of High Furness were charged with the care of flocks and
            herds, to protect them from the wolves which lurked in the thickets, and in winter to
            browze them with the tender sprouts of hollies and ash. This custom was not till lately
            discontinued in High Furness; and holly-trees were carefully preserved for that purpose
            when all other wood was cleared off; large tracts of common being so covered with these
            trees, as to have the appearance of a forest of hollies. At the Shepherd's call, the
            flocks surrounded the hollybush, and received the croppings at his hand, which they
            greedily nibbled up, bleating for <pb rend="none"/> more. The Abbots of Furness enfranchised these
            pastoral vassals, and permitted them to enclose <emph>quillets</emph> to
            their houses, for which they paid encroachment rent."—West's <title level="m">Antiquities of Furness.</title>
                  </p>
                  <p> However desirable, for the purposes of defence, a numerous population might be, it was
            not possible to make at once the same numerous allotments among the untilled vallies,
            and upon the sides of the mountains, as had been made in the cultivated plains. The
            enfranchised shepherd, or woodlander, having chosen there his place of residence, builds
            it of sods, or of the mountain-stone, and, with the permission of his lord, encloses,
            like Robinson Crusoe, a small croft or two immediately at his door for such animals as
            he wishes to protect. Others are happy to imitate his example, and avail themselves of
            the same privileges: and thus a population, mainly of Danish or Norse origin, as the
            dialect indicates, crept on towards the more secluded parts of the vallies. Chapels,
            daughters of some distant mother church, are first erected in the more open and fertile
            vales, as those of Bowness and Grasmere, offsets of Kendal: which again, after a period,
            as the settled population increases, become mother-churches to smaller edifices,
            planted, at length, in almost every dale throughout the country. The inclosures, formed
            by the tenantry, are for a long time confined to the home-steads; and the arable and
            meadow land of the vales is possessed in common field; the <pb rend="none"/> several portions being
            marked out by stones, bushes, or trees: which portions, where the custom has survived,
            to this day are called <emph>dales</emph>, from the word <emph>deylen</emph>, to distribute; but, while the valley was thus lying open, enclosures
            seem to have taken place upon the sides of the mountains; because the land there was not
            intermixed, and was of little comparative value; and, therefore, small opposition would
            be made to its being appropriated by those to whose habitations it was contiguous. Hence
            the singular appearance which the sides of many of these mountains exhibit, intersected,
            as they are, almost to the summit, with stone walls. When first erected, these stone
            fences must have little disfigured the face of the country; as part of the lines would
            every where be hidden by the quantity of native wood then remaining; and the lines would
            also be broken (as they still are) by the rocks which interrupt and vary their course.
            In the meadows, and in those parts of the lower grounds where the soil has not been
            sufficiently drained, and could not afford a stable foundation, there, when the
            increasing value of land, and the inconvenience suffered from intermixed plots of ground
            in common field, had induced each inhabitant to enclose his own, they were compelled to
            make the fences of alders, willows, and other trees. These, where the native wood had
            disappeared, have frequently enriched the vallies with a sylvan appearance; while the
            intricate intermixture of property has given <pb rend="none"/> to the fences a graceful
            irregularity, which, where large properties are prevalent, and large capitals employed
            in agriculture, is unknown. This sylvan appearance is heightened by the number of
            ash-trees planted in rows along the quick fences, and along the walls, for the purpose
            of browzing the cattle at the approach of winter. The branches are lopped off and strewn
            upon the pastures; and when the cattle have stripped them of the leaves, they are used
            for repairing the hedges or for fuel. </p>
                  <p> We have thus seen a numerous body of Dalesmen creeping into possession of their
            home-steads, their little crofts, their mountain-enclosures; and, finally, the whole
            vale is visibly divided; except, perhaps, here and there some marshy ground, which, till
            fully drained, would not repay the trouble of enclosing. But these last partitions do
            not seem to have been general, till long after the pacification of the Borders, by the
            union of the two crowns: when the cause, which had first determined the distribution of
            land into such small parcels, had not only ceased,—but likewise a general
            improvement had taken place in the country, with a correspondent rise in the value of
            its produce. From the time of the union, it is certain that this species of feudal
            population must rapidly have diminished. That it was formerly much more numerous than it
            is at present, is evident from the multitude of tenements (I do not mean houses, but
            small divisions of land) which belonged formerly each <pb rend="none"/> to a several proprietor, and
            for which separate fines are paid to the manorial lord at this day. These are often in
            the proportion of four to one of the present occupants. "<ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n099.html">Sir
              Launcelot</ref> Threlkeld, who lived in the reign of Henry VII., was wont to say, he
            had three noble houses, one for pleasure, Crosby, in Westmoreland, where he had a park
            full of deer; one for profit and warmth, wherein to reside in winter, namely, Yanwith,
            nigh Penrith; and the third, Threlkeld, (on the edge of the vale of Keswick), well
            stocked with tenants to go with him to the wars." But, as I have said, from the
            union of the two crowns, this numerous vassalage (their services not being wanted) would
            rapidly diminish; various tenements would be united in one possessor; and the aboriginal
            houses, probably little better than hovels, like the kraels of savages, or the huts of
            the Highlanders of Scotland, would fall into decay, and the places of many be supplied
            by substantial and comfortable buildings, a majority of which remain to this day
            scattered over the vallies, and are often the only dwellings found in them. </p>
                  <p> From the time of the erection of these houses, till within the last sixty years, the
            state of society, though no doubt slowly and gradually improving, underwent no material
            change. Corn was grown in these vales (through which no carriage-road had yet been made)
            sufficient upon each estate to furnish bread for each family, and no more:
            notwithstanding the union of several tenements, the possessions of each <pb rend="none"/> inhabitant
            still being small, in the same field was seen an intermixture of different crops; and
            the plough was interrupted by little rocks, mostly overgrown with wood, or by spongy
            places, which the tillers of the soil had neither leisure nor capital to convert into
            firm land. The storms and moisture of the climate induced them to sprinkle their upland
            property with outhouses of native stone, as places of shelter for their sheep, where, in
            tempestuous weather, food was distributed to them. Every family spun from its own flock
            the wool with which it was clothed; a weaver was here and there found among them; and
            the rest of their wants was supplied by the produce of the yarn, which they carded and
            spun in their own houses, and carried to market, either under their arms, or more
            frequently on pack-horses, a small train taking their way weekly down the valley or over
            the mountains to the most commodious town. They had, as I have said, their rural chapel,
            and of course their minister, in clothing or in manner of life, in no respect differing
            from themselves, except on the Sabbath-day; this was the sole distinguished individual
            among them; every thing else, person and possession, exhibited a perfect equality, a
            community of shepherds and agriculturists, proprietors, for the most part, of the lands
            which they occupied and cultivated. </p>
                  <p> While the process above detailed was going on, the native forest must have been every
            where receding; but trees were planted for <pb rend="none"/> the sustenance of the flocks in
            winter,—such was then the rude state of agriculture; and, for the same cause, it
            was necessary that care should be taken of some part of the growth of the native woods.
            Accordingly, in Queen Elizabeth's time, this was so strongly felt, that a petition was
            made to the Crown, praying, "<ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n100.html">that the Blomaries in High Furness
              might be abolished</ref>, on account of the quantity of wood which was consumed in them for
              the use of the mines, to the great detriment of the cattle." But this same
            cause, about a hundred years after, produced effects directly contrary to those which
            had been deprecated. The re-establishment, at that period, of furnaces upon a large
            scale, made it the interest of the people to convert the steeper and more stony of the
            enclosures, sprinkled over with remains of the native forest, into close woods, which,
            when cattle and sheep were excluded, rapidly sowed and thickened themselves. The
            reader's attention has been directed to the cause by which tufts of wood, pasturage,
            meadow, and arable land, with its various produce, are intricately intermingled in the
            same field; and he will now see, in like manner, how enclosures entirely of wood, and
            those of cultivated ground, are blended all over the country under a law of similar
            wildness. </p>
                  <p> An historic detail has thus been given of the manner in which the hand of man has
            acted upon the surface of the inner regions of this mountainous country, as incorporated
            with <pb rend="none"/> and subservient to the powers and processes of nature. We will now take a
            view of the same agency—acting, within narrower bounds, for the production of the
            few works of art and accommodations of life which, in so simple a state of society,
            could be necessary. These are merely habitations of man and coverts for beasts, roads
            and bridges, and places of worship. </p>
                  <p>And to begin with the COTTAGES. They are scattered over the vallies, and under the hill
            sides, and on the rocks; and, even to this day, in the more retired dales, without any
            intrusion of more assuming buildings;</p>

                  <p>The dwelling-houses, and contiguous outhouses, are, in many instances, of the colour of
            the native rock, out of which they have been built; but, frequently the Dwelling or
            Fire-house, as it is ordinarily called, has been distinguished from the barn or byer by
              <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n102.html">rough-cast and white wash</ref>, which, as the inhabitants are not
            hasty in renewing it, in a few years acquires, by the influence of weather, a tint at
            once sober and variegated. As these houses have been, from father to son, inhabited by
            persons engaged in the same occupations, yet necessarily with changes in their
            circumstances, they have received without incongru<!-- - --><pb rend="none"/>ity additions and
            accommodations adapted to the needs of each successive occupant, who, being for the most
            part proprietor, was at liberty to follow his own fancy: so that these humble dwellings
            remind the contemplative spectator of a production of nature, and may (using a strong
            expression) rather be said to have grown than to have been erected;—to have risen,
            by an instinct of their own, out of the native rock—so little is there in them of
            formality, such is their wildness and beauty. Among the numerous recesses and
            projections in the walls and in the different stages of their roofs, are seen bold and
            harmonious effects of contrasted sunshine and shadow. It is a favourable circumstance,
            that the strong winds, which sweep down the vallies, induced the inhabitants, at a time
            when the materials for building were easily procured, to furnish many of these dwellings
            with substantial porches; and such as have not this defence, are seldom unprovided with
            a projection of two large slates over their thresholds. Nor will <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n103.html">the
              singular beauty of the chimneys</ref> escape the eye of the attentive traveller.
            Sometimes a low chimney, almost upon a level with the roof, is overlaid with a slate,
            supported upon four slender pillars, to prevent the wind from driving the smoke down the
            chimney. Others are of a quadrangular shape, rising one or two feet above the roof;
            which low square is often surmounted by a tall cylinder, giving to the cottage chimney
            the most beautiful shape in <pb rend="none"/> which it is ever seen. Nor will it be too fanciful or
            refined to remark, that there is a pleasing harmony between a tall chimney of this
            circular form, and the living column of smoke, ascending from it through the still air.
            These dwellings, mostly built, as has been said, of rough unhewn stone, are roofed with
            slates, which were rudely taken from the quarry before the present art of splitting them
            was understood, and are, therefore, rough and uneven in their surface, so that both the
            coverings and sides of the houses have furnished places of rest for the seeds of
            lichens, mosses, ferns, and flowers. Hence buildings, which in their very form call to
            mind the processes of nature, do thus, clothed in part with a vegetable garb, appear to
            be received into the bosom of the living principle of things, as it acts and exists
            among the woods and fields; and, by their colour and their shape, affectingly direct the
            thoughts to that tranquil course of nature and simplicity, along which the humble-minded
            inhabitants have, through so many generations, been led. Add the little garden with its
            shed for bee-hives, its small bed of pot-herbs, and its borders and patches of flowers
            for Sunday posies, with sometimes a choice few too much prized to be plucked; an orchard
            of proportioned size; a cheesepress, often supported by some tree near the door; a
            cluster of embowering sycamores for summer shade; with a tall fir, through which the
            winds sing when other trees are leafless; <pb rend="none"/> the little rill or household spout
            murmuring in all seasons;—combine these incidents and images together, and you
            have the representative idea of a mountain-cottage in this country so beautifully formed
            in itself, and so richly adorned by the hand of nature. </p>
                  <p>Till within the last sixty years there was no communication between any of these vales
            by carriage-roads; all bulky articles were transported on pack-horses. Owing, however,
            to the population not being concentrated in villages, but scattered, the vallies
            themselves were intersected as now by innumerable lanes and path-ways leading from house
            to house and from field to field. These lanes, where they are fenced by stone walls, are
            mostly bordered with ashes, hazels, wild roses, and beds of tall fern at their base;
            while the walls themselves, if old, are overspread with mosses, small ferns, wild
            strawberries, the geranium, and lichens: and, if the wall happen to rest against a bank
            of earth, it is sometimes almost wholly concealed by a rich facing of stone-fern. It is
            a great advantage to a traveller or resident, that these numerous lanes and paths, if he
            be a zealous admirer of nature, will lead him on into all the recesses of the country,
            so that the hidden treasures of its landscapes may, by an ever-ready guide, be laid open
            to his eyes. </p>
                  <p>Likewise to the smallness of the several properties is owing the great number of
            bridges over the brooks and torrents, and the daring <pb rend="none"/> and graceful neglect of
            danger or accommodation with which so many of them are constructed, the rudeness of the
            forms of some, and their endless variety. But, when I speak of this rudeness, I must at
            the same time add, that many of these structures are in themselves models of elegance,
            as if they had been formed upon principles of the most thoughtful architecture. It is to
            be regretted that these monuments of the skill of our ancestors, and of that happy
            instinct by which consummate beauty was produced, are disappearing fast; but sufficient
            specimens remain<note resp="author" place="foot">Written some time ago. The injury done
              since, is more than could have been calculated upon. <emph>
                           <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n104.html">Singula de nobis anni praedantur euntes</ref>
                        </emph>. This is in the
              course of things; but why should the genius that directed the ancient architecture of
              these vales have deserted them? For the bridges, churches, mansions, cottages, and
              their richly fringed and flat-roofed outhouses, venerable as the grange of some old
              abbey, have been substituted structures, in which baldness only seems to have been
              studied, or plans of the most vulgar utility. But some improvement may be looked for
              in future; the gentry <emph>recently</emph> have copied the old models, and
              successful instances might be pointed out, if I could take the liberty.</note> to give
            a high gratification to the man of genuine taste. Travellers who may not have been
            accustomed to pay attention to things so inobtrusive, will excuse me if I point out the
            proportion between the span and elevation of the arch, the lightness of the parapet, and
            the graceful manner in which its curve follows faithfully that of the arch. <pb rend="none"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon this subject I have nothing further to notice, except the PLACES OF WORSHIP, which
            have mostly a little school-house adjoining.<note resp="author" place="foot">In some
              places scholars were formerly taught in the church, and at others the school-house was
              a sort of anti-chapel to the place of worship, being under the same roof; an
              arrangement which was abandoned as irreverent. It continues, however, to this day in
              Borrowdale. In the parish register of that chapelry is a notice, that a youth who had
              quitted the valley, and died in one of the towns on the coast of Cumberland, had
              requested that his body should be brought and interred at the foot of the pillar by
              which he had been accustomed to sit while a school-boy. One cannot but regret that
              parish registers so seldom contain any thing but bare names; in a few of this country,
              especially in that of Loweswater, I have found interesting notices of unusual natural
              occurrences—characters of the deceased, and particulars of their lives. There is no
              good reason why such memorials should not be frequent; these <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n106.html">short
                and simple annals</ref> would in future ages become precious.</note> The
            architecture of these churches and chapels, where they have not been recently rebuilt or
            modernised, is of a style not less appropriate and admirable than that of the dwelling
            houses and other structures. How sacred the spirit by which our forefathers were
            directed! The <emph>
                        <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n105.html">religio loci</ref>
                     </emph> is no where
            violated by these unstinted, yet unpretending, works of human hands. They exhibit
            generally a well-proportioned oblong, with a suitable porch, in some instances a steeple
            tower, and in others nothing more than a small belfry, in which one or two bells hang
            visibly. But these objects, though pleasing in their forms, must <pb rend="none"/> necessarily, more
            than others in rural scenery, derive their interest from the sentiments of piety and
            reverence for the modest virtues and simple manners of humble life with which they may
            be contemplated. A man must be very insensible who would not be touched with pleasure at
            the sight of the <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n107.html">chapel of Buttermere</ref>, so strikingly
            expressing, by its diminutive size, how small must be the congregation there assembled,
            as it were, like one family; and proclaiming at the same time to the passenger, in
            connection with the surrounding mountains, the depth of that seclusion in which the
            people live, that has rendered necessary the building of a separate place of worship for
            so few. A patriot, calling to mind the images of the stately fabrics of Canterbury,
            York, or Westminster, will find a heart-felt satisfaction in presence of this lowly
            pile, as a monument of the wise institutions of our country, and as evidence of the
            all-pervading and paternal care of that venerable Establishment, of which it is,
            perhaps, the humblest daughter. The edifice is scarcely larger than many of the single
            stones or fragments of rock which are scattered near it. </p>
                  <p>We have thus far confined our observations on this division of the subject, to that
            part of these Dales which runs up far into the mountains. </p>
                  <p>As we descend towards the open country, we meet with halls and mansions, many of which
            have been places of defence against the <pb rend="none"/> incursions of the Scottish borderers; and
            they not unfrequently retain their towers and battlements. To these houses, parks are
            sometimes attached, and to their successive proprietors we chiefly owe whatever ornament
            is still left to the country of majestic timber. Through the open parts of the vales are
            scattered, also, houses of a middle rank between the pastoral cottage and the old hall
            residence of the knight or esquire. Such houses differ much from the rugged cottages
            before described, and are generally graced with a little court or garden in front, where
            may yet be seen specimens of those fantastic and quaint figures which our ancestors were
            fond of shaping out in yew-tree, holly, or box-wood. The passenger will sometimes smile
            at such elaborate display of petty art, while the house does not deign to look upon the
            natural beauty or the sublimity which its situation almost unavoidably commands. </p>
                  <p>Thus has been given a faithful description, the minuteness of which the reader will
            pardon, of the face of this country as it was, and had been through centuries, till
            within the last sixty years. Towards the head of these Dales was found a perfect
            Republic of Shepherds and Agriculturists, among whom the plough of each man was confined
            to the maintenance of his own family, or to the occasional accommodation of his
              neighbour.<note resp="author" place="foot"> One of the most pleasing characteristics of
              manners in secluded and thinly-peopled districts, is a sense of the degree in which
              human happiness and comfort are dependent on the contingency of neighbourhood. This is
              implied by a rhyming adage common here, <emph>"<ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n108.html">Friends are far, when neighbours are nar</ref>
                        </emph>" (near). This mutual
              helpfulness is not confined to out-of-doors work; but is ready upon all occasions.
              Formerly, if a person became sick, especially the mistress of a family, it was usual
              for those of the neighbours who were more particularly connected with the party by
              amicable offices, to visit the house, carrying a present; this practice, which is by
              no means obsolete, is called <emph>owning</emph> the family, and is regarded as a pledge
              of a disposition to be otherwise serviceable in a time of disability and
              distress.</note> Two or three <pb rend="none"/> cows furnished each family with milk and cheese.
            The chapel was the only edifice that presided over these dwellings, the supreme head of
            this pure Commonwealth; the members of which existed in the midst of a powerful empire
            like an ideal society or an organized community, whose constitution had been imposed and
            regulated by the mountains which protected it. Neither high-born nobleman, knight, nor
            esquire was here; but many of these humble sons of the hills had a consciousness that
            the land, which they walked over and tilled, had for more than five hundred years been
            possessed by men of their name and blood; and venerable was the transition, when a
            curious traveller, descending from the heart of the mountains, had come to some ancient
            manorial residence in the more open parts of the Vales, which, through the <pb rend="none"/> rights
            attached to its proprietor, connected the almost visionary mountain republic he had been
            contemplating with the substantial frame of society as existing in the laws and
            constitution of a mighty empire.<pb rend="none"/>

                  <p>Such, as hath been said, was the appearance of things till within <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n109.html">the last sixty years</ref>. A practice, denominated <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n110.html">Ornamental
              Gardening</ref>, was at that time becoming prevalent over England. In union with an
            admiration of this art, and in some instances in opposition to it, had been generated a
            relish for select parts of natural scenery: and <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n111.html">Travellers</ref>,
            instead of confining their observations to Towns, Manufactories, or Mines, began (a
            thing till then unheard of) to wander over the island in search of sequestered spots,
            distinguished as they might accidentally have learned, for the sublimity or beauty of
            the forms of Nature there to be seen. —<ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n112.html">Dr. Brown</ref>, the
            celebrated Author of the Estimate of the Manners and Principles of the Times, published
            a letter to a friend, in which the attractions of the Vale of Keswick were delineated
            with a powerful pencil, and the feeling of a genuine Enthusiast. <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n113.html">Gray, the Poet</ref>, followed: he died soon after his forlorn and melancholy
            pilgrimage to the Vale of Keswick, and the record left behind him of what he had seen
            and felt in this journey, excited that pensive interest with which the human mind is
            ever disposed to listen to the farewell words <pb rend="none"/> of a man of genius. The journal of
            Gray feelingly showed how the gloom of ill-health and low spirits had been irradiated by
            objects, which the Author's powers of mind enabled him to describe with distinctness and
            unaffected simplicity. Every reader of this journal must have been impressed with the
            words which conclude <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n114.html">his notice of the Vale of
            Grasmere</ref>:—"Not a single red tile, no flaring gentleman's house or
            garden-wall, breaks in upon the repose of this little unsuspected paradise; but all is
            peace, rusticity, and happy poverty, in its neatest and most becoming attire." </p>
                  <p>What is here so justly said of Grasmere applied almost equally to all its sister Vales.
            It was well for the undisturbed pleasure of the Poet that he had no forebodings of the
            change which was soon to take place; and it might have been hoped that these words,
            indicating how much the charm of what <emph>was</emph> depended upon what was
              <emph>not</emph>, would of themselves have preserved the ancient franchises
            of this and other kindred mountain retirements from trespass; or (shall I dare to say?)
            would have secured scenes so consecrated from profanation. The lakes had now become
            celebrated; visitors flocked hither from all parts of England; the fancies of some were
            smitten so deeply that they became settlers; and the Islands of Derwentwater and
            Winandermere, as they offered the strongest temptation, were the first places seized
            upon, and were instantly defaced by the intrusion. <pb rend="none"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>The venerable wood that had grown for centuries round the small house called <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n115.html">St. Herbert's Hermitage</ref>, had indeed some years before been felled
            by its native proprietor, and the whole island planted anew with Scotch firs, left to
            spindle up by each other's side—a melancholy phalanx, defying the power of the
            winds, and disregarding the regret of the spectator, who might otherwise have cheated
            himself into a belief that some of the decayed remains of those oaks, the place of which
            was in this manner usurped, had been planted by the Hermit's own hand: This sainted
            spot, however, suffered comparatively little injury. At the bidding of <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n116.html">an alien improver</ref>, the Hind's Cottage, upon <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n117.html">Vicar's island</ref>, in the same lake, with its embowering sycamores and
            cattle-shed, disappeared from the corner where they stood; and right in the middle, and
            upon the precise point of the island's highest elevation, rose a tall square habitation,
            with four sides exposed, like an astronomer's observatory, or a warrenhouse reared upon
            an eminence for the detection of depredators, or, like the temple of <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n118.html">Œolus</ref>, where all the winds pay him obeisance. Round this novel structure, but
            at a respectful distance, platoons of firs were stationed, as if to protect their
            commander when weather and time should somewhat have shattered his strength. Within the
            narrow limits of this island were typified also the state and strength of a kingdom, and
            its religion as it had been, and was,—for neither was the druidical circle <pb rend="none"/>
            uncreated, nor the church of the present establishment; nor the stately pier, emblem of
            commerce and navigation; nor the fort to deal out thunder upon the approaching invader.
            The taste of a succeeding proprietor rectified the mistakes as far as was practicable,
            and has ridded the spot of its puerilities. The church, after having been docked of its
            steeple, is applied, both ostensibly and really, to the purpose for which the body of
            the pile was actually erected, namely, a boat-house; the fort is demolished; and,
            without indignation on the part of the spirits of the ancient Druids who officiated at
              <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n119.html">the circle upon the opposite hill</ref>, the mimic arrangement of
            stones, with its <emph>
                        <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n120.html">sanctum santorum</ref>
                     </emph>, has
            been swept away. </p>
                  <p>The present instance has been singled out, extravagant as it is, because,
            unquestionably, this beautiful country has, in numerous other places, suffered from the
            same spirit, though not clothed exactly in the same form, nor active in an equal degree.
            It will be sufficient here to utter a regret for the <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n121.html">changes that
              have been made upon the principal Island at Winandermere</ref>, and in its
            neighbourhood. What could be more unfortunate than the taste that suggested the paring
            of the shores, and surrounding with an embankment this spot of ground, the natural shape
            of which was so beautiful! An artificial appearance has thus been given to the whole,
            while infinite varieties of minute beauty have been destroyed. Could not the margin of
            this noble island be <pb rend="none"/> given back to nature? Winds and waves work with a careless
            and graceful hand: and, should they in some places carry away a portion of the soil, the
            trifling loss would be amply compensated by the additional spirit, dignity, and
            loveliness, which these agents and the other powers of nature would soon communicate to
            what was left behind. As to the larch-plantations upon the main shore,—they who
            remember the original appearance of the rocky steeps, scattered over with native hollies
            and ash-trees, will be prepared to agree with what I shall have to say hereafter upon
              plantations<note resp="author" place="foot"> These are disappearing fast, under the
              management of the present Proprietor, and native wood is resuming its place.</note>in
            general. </p>
                  <p>But, in truth, no one can now travel through the more frequented tracts, without being
            offended, at almost every turn, by an introduction of discordant objects, disturbing
            that peaceful harmony of form and colour, which had been through a long lapse of ages
            most happily preserved. </p>
                  <p>All gross transgressions of this kind originate, doubtless, in a feeling natural and
            honourable to the human mind, viz. the pleasure which it receives from distinct ideas,
            and from the perception of order, regularity, and contrivance. Now, unpractised minds
            receive these impressions only from objects that are divided from each other by strong
            lines of demarcation; hence the delight with which such minds are <pb rend="none"/> smitten by
            formality and harsh contrast. But I would beg of those who are eager to create the means
            of such gratification, first carefully to study what already exists; and they will find,
            in a country so lavishly gifted by nature, an abundant variety of forms marked out with
            a precision that will satisfy their desires. Moreover, a new habit of pleasure will be
            formed opposite to this, arising out of the perception of the fine gradations by which
            in nature one thing passes away into another, and the boundaries that constitute
            individuality disappear in one instance only to be revived elsewhere under a more
            alluring form. The hill of Dunmallet, at the foot of Ulswater, was once divided into
            different portions, by avenues of fir-trees, with a green and almost perpendicular lane
            descending down the steep hill through each avenue;—contrast this quaint
            appearance with the image of the same hill overgrown with self-planted wood,—each
            tree springing up in the situation best suited to its kind, and with that shape which
            the situation constrained or suffered it to take. What endless melting and playing into
            each other of forms and colours does the one offer to a mind at once attentive and
            active; and how insipid and lifeless, compared with it, appear those parts of the former
            exhibition with which a child, a peasant perhaps, or a citizen unfamiliar with natural
            imagery, would have been most delighted!</p>
                  <p>The disfigurement which this country has <pb rend="none"/> undergone, has not, however, proceeded
            wholly from the common feelings of human nature which have been referred to as the
            primary sources of bad taste in rural imagery; another cause must be added, that has
            chiefly shown itself in its effect upon buildings. I mean a warping of the natural mind
            occasioned by a consciousness that, this country being an object of general admiration,
            every new house would be looked at and commented upon either for approbation or censure.
            Hence all the deformity and ungracefulness that ever pursue the steps of constraint or
            affectation. Persons, who in Leicestershire or Northamptonshire would probably have
            built a modest dwelling like those of their sensible neighbours, have been turned out of
            their course; and, acting a part, no wonder if, having had little experience, they act
            it ill. The craving for prospect, also, which is immoderate, particularly in new
            settlers, has rendered it impossible that buildings, whatever might have been their
            architecture, should in most instances be ornamental to the landscape; rising as they do
            from the summits of naked hills in staring contrast to the snugness and privacy of the
            ancient houses.</p>
                  <p> No man is to be condemned for a desire to decorate his residence and possessions;
            feeling a disposition to applaud such an endeavour, I would show how the end may be best
            attained. The rule is simple; with respect to grounds—work, where you can, in the
            spirit <pb rend="none"/> of nature, with an invisible hand of art. Planting, and a removal of wood,
            may thus, and thus only, be carried on with good effect; and the like may be said of
            building, if Antiquity, who may be styled the co-partner and sister of Nature, be not
            denied the respect to which she is entitled. I have already spoken of the beautiful
            forms of the ancient mansions of this country, and of the happy manner in which they
            harmonise with the forms of nature. Why cannot such be taken as a model, and modern
            internal convenience be confined within their external grace and dignity? Expense to be
            avoided, or difficulties to be overcome, may prevent a close adherence to this model;
            still, however, it might be followed to a certain degree in the style of architecture
            and in the choice of situation, if the thirst for prospect were mitigated by those
            considerations of comfort, shelter, and convenience, which used to be chiefly sought
            after. But should an aversion to old fashions unfortunately exist, accompanied with a
            desire to transplant into the cold and stormy North, the elegancies of a villa formed
            upon a model taken from countries with a milder climate, I will adduce <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n122.html">a passage from an English poet, the divine Spenser</ref>, which will
            show in what manner such a plan may be realised without injury to the native beauty of
            these scenes.</p>

                  <p>Houses or mansions suited to a mountainous region, should be "<ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n123.html">not
              obvious, not obtrusive, but retired</ref>;" and the reasons for this rule, though they
            have been little adverted to, are evident. Mountainous countries, more frequently and
            forcibly than others, remind us of the power of the elements, as manifested in winds,
            snows, and torrents, and accordingly make the notion of exposure very unpleasing; while
            shelter and comfort are in proportion necessary and acceptable. Far-winding vallies
            difficult of access, and the feelings of simplicity habitually connected with mountain
            retirements, prompt us to turn from ostentation as a thing there eminently unnatural and
            out of place. A mansion, amid such scenes, can never have sufficient dignity or interest
            to become principal in the landscape, and to render the mountains, lakes, or torrents,
            by which it may be surrounded, a subordinate <pb rend="none"/> part of the view. It is, I grant,
            easy to conceive, that an ancient castellated building, hanging over a precipice or
            raised upon an island, or the peninsula of a lake, like that of <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n124.html">Kilchurn Castle, upon Loch Awe</ref>, may not want, whether deserted or inhabited,
            sufficient majesty to preside for a moment in the spectator's thoughts over the high
            mountains among which it is embosomed; but its titles are from antiquity—a power
            readily submitted to upon occasion as the vicegerent of Nature: it is respected, as
            having owed its existence to the necessities of things, as a monument of security in
            times of disturbance and danger long passed away,—as a record of the pomp and
            violence of passion, and a symbol of the wisdom of law;—it bears a countenance
            of authority, which is not impaired by decay.</p>

                  <p>To such honours a modern edifice can lay no claim; and the puny efforts of elegance
            appear contemptible, when, in such situations, they are obtruded in rivalship with the
            sublimities of Nature. But, towards the verge of a district like this of which we are
            treating, where the mountains subside into hills of moderate elevation, or in an
            undulating or flat country, a gentleman's mansion may, with propriety, become a
            principal feature in the landscape; <pb rend="none"/> and, itself being a work of art, works and
            traces of artificial ornament may, without censure, be extended around it, as they will
            be referred to the common centre, the house; the right of which to impress within
            certain limits a character of obvious ornament will not be denied, where no commanding
            forms of nature dispute it, or set it aside. Now, to a want of the perception of this
            difference, and to the causes before assigned, may chiefly be attributed the
            disfigurement which the Country of the Lakes has undergone, from persons who may have
            built, demolished, and planted, with full confidence, that every change and addition was
            or would become an improvement. </p>
                  <p> The principle that ought to determine the position, apparent size, and architecture of
            a house, viz. that it should be so constructed, and (if large) so much of it hidden, as
            to admit of its being gently incorporated into the scenery of nature—should also
            determine its colour. <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n126.html">Sir Joshua Reynolds used to say</ref>, "If you
            would fix upon the best colour for your house, turn up a stone, or pluck up a handful of
            grass by the roots, and see what is the colour of the soil where the house is to stand,
            and let that be your choice." Of course, this precept given in conversation, could not
            have been meant to be taken literally. For example, in <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n127.html">Low
              Furness</ref>, where the soil, from its strong impregnation with iron, is universally
            of a deep red, if this rule <pb rend="none"/> were strictly followed, the house also must be of a
            glaring red; in other places it must be of a sullen black; which would only be adding
            annoyance to annoyance. The rule, however, as a general guide, is good; and, in
            agricultural districts, where large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough,
            particularly if (the face of the country being undulating) they are held up to view,
            this rule, though not to be implicitly adhered to, should never be lost sight
            of;—the colour of the house ought, if possible, to have a cast or shade of the
            colour of the soil. The principle is, that the house must harmonise with the surrounding
            landscape: accordingly, in mountainous countries, with still more confidence may it be
            said, "look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible, and
            they will furnish a safe direction." Nevertheless, it will often happen that the rocks
            may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the landscape, and may be of such a tone
            of colour, that the rule may not admit, even here, of being implicitly followed. For
            instance, the chief defect in the colouring of the Country of the Lakes (which is most
            strongly felt in the summer season) is an over-prevalence of a bluish tint, which the
            green of the herbage, the fern, and the woods, does not sufficiently counteract. If a
            house, therefore, should stand where this defect prevails, I have no hesitation in
            saying, that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that <pb rend="none"/> could
            be chosen. A tint ought to be introduced approaching nearer to those which, in the
            technical language of painters, are called <emph>warm</emph>: this, if
            happily selected, would not disturb, but would animate the landscape. How often do we
            see this exemplified upon a small scale by the native cottages, in cases where the glare
            of white-wash has been subdued by time and enriched by weather-stains! No harshness is
            then seen; but one of these cottages, thus coloured, will often form a central point to
            a landscape by which the whole shall be connected, and an influence of pleasure diffused
            over all the objects that compose the picture. But where the cold blue tint of the rocks
            is enriched by the iron tinge, the colour cannot be too closely imitated; and it will be
            produced of itself by the stones hewn from the adjoining quarry, and by the mortar,
            which may be tempered with the most gravelly part of the soil. The pure blue gravel,
            from the bed of the river, is, however, more suitable to the mason's purpose, who will
            probably insist also that the house must be covered with rough-cast, otherwise it cannot
            be kept dry; if this advice be taken, the builder of taste will set about contriving
            such means as may enable him to come the nearest to the effect aimed at. </p>
                  <p> The supposed necessity of rough-cast to keep out rain in houses not built of hewn
            stone or brick, has tended greatly to injure English landscape, and the neighbourhood of
            these <pb rend="none"/> Lakes especially, by furnishing such apt occasion for whitening buildings.
            That white should be a favourite colour for rural residences is natural for many
            reasons. The mere aspect of cleanliness and neatness thus given, not only to an
            individual house, but, where the practice is general, to the whole face of the country,
            produces moral associations so powerful, that, in many minds, they take place of all
            others. But what has already been said upon the subject of cottages, must have convinced
            men of feeling and imagination, that a human dwelling of the humblest class may be
            rendered more deeply interesting to the affections, and far more pleasing to the eye, by
            other influences, than a sprightly tone of colour spread over its outside. I do not,
            however, mean to deny, that a small white building, embowered in trees, may, in some
            situations, be a delightful and animating object—in no way injurious to the
            landscape; but this only where it sparkles from the midst of a thick shade, and in rare
            and solitary instances; especially if the country be itself rich and pleasing, and
            abound with grand forms. On the sides of bleak and desolate moors, we are indeed
            thankful for the sight of white cottages and white houses plentifully scattered, where,
            without these, perhaps every thing would be cheerless: this is said, however, with
            hesitation, and with a wilful sacrifice of some higher enjoyments. But I have certainly
            seen such buildings glittering at sunrise, and in wandering lights, with no common
            pleasure. <pb rend="none"/> The continental traveller also will remember, that the convents hanging
            from the rocks of the Rhine, the Rhone, the Danube, or among the Appenines, or the
            mountains of Spain, are not looked at with less complacency when, as is often the case,
            they happen to be of a brilliant white. But this is perhaps owing, in no small degree,
            to the contrast of that lively colour with the gloom of monastic life, and to the
            general want of rural residences of smiling and attractive appearance, in those
            countries.</p>
                  <p>The objections to white, as a colour, in large spots or masses in landscape, especially
            in a mountainous country, are insurmountable. In nature, pure white is scarcely ever
            found but in small objects, such as flowers; or in those which are transitory, as the
            clouds, foam of rivers, and snow. <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n128.html">Mr. Gilpin, who notices this, has
              also recorded the just remark of Mr. Locke</ref>, of N-----, that white destroys the
              <emph>gradations</emph> of distance; and, therefore, an object of pure
            white can scarcely ever be managed with good effect in landscape-painting. Five or six
            white houses, scattered over a valley, by their obtrusiveness, dot the surface, and
            divide it into triangles, or other mathematical figures, haunting the eye, and
            disturbing that repose which might otherwise be perfect. I have seen <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n129.html">a single white house</ref> materially impair the majesty of a mountain; cutting away,
            by a harsh separation, the whole of its base, below the point on which the house stood.
            Thus was the apparent size of the mountain reduced, <pb rend="none"/> not by the interposition of
            another object in a manner to call forth the imagination, which will give more than the
            eye loses; but what had been abstracted in this case was left visible; and the mountain
            appeared to take its beginning, or to rise, from the line of the house, instead of its
            own natural base. But, if I may express my own individual feeling, it is after sunset,
            at the coming on of twilight, that white objects are most to be complained of. The
            solemnity and quietness of nature at that time are always marred, and often destroyed by
            them. When the ground is covered with snow, they are of course inoffensive; and in
            moonshine they are always pleasing—it is a tone of light with which they accord:
            and the dimness of the scene is enlivened by an object at once conspicuous and cheerful.
            I will conclude this subject with noticing that the cold, slaty colour, which many
            persons, who have heard the white condemned, have adopted in its stead, must be
            disapproved of for the reason already given. The flaring yellow runs into the opposite
            extreme, and is still more censurable. Upon the whole, the safest colour for general use
            is something between a cream and a dustcolour, commonly called stone colour;—there
            are, among the Lakes, examples of this that need not be pointed out.<note resp="author" place="foot"> A proper colouring of houses is now becoming general. It is best that
              the colouring material should be mixed with the rough-cast, and not laid on as a
              <emph>wash</emph> afterwards.</note>
                     <pb rend="none"/>
                  </p>
                  <p> The principle taken as our guide, viz. that the house should be so formed, and of such
            apparent size and colour, as to admit of its being gently incorporated with the works of
            nature, should also be applied to the management of the grounds and plantations, and is
            here more urgently needed; for it is from abuses in this department, far more even than
            from the introduction of exotics in architecture (if the phrase may be used), that this
            country has suffered. <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n130.html">Larch and fir plantations</ref> have been
            spread, not merely with a view to profit, but in many instances for the sake of
            ornament. To those who plant for profit, and are thrusting every other tree out of the
            way, to make room for their favourite, the larch, I would utter first a regret that they
            should have selected these lovely vales for their vegetable manufactory, when there is
            so much barren and irreclaimable land in the neighbouring moors, and in other parts of
            the island, which might have been had for this purpose at a far cheaper rate. And I will
            also beg leave to represent to them, that they ought not to be carried away by
            flattering promises from the speedy growth of this tree; because in rich soils and
            sheltered situations, the wood, though it thrives fast, is full of sap and of little
            value; and is, likewise, very subject to ravage from the attacks of insects, and from
            blight. Accordingly, in Scotland, where planting is much better understood, and carried
            on upon an incomparably larger scale than among us, good soil and sheltered situations
            are appropriated to the oak, the ash, <pb rend="none"/> and other deciduous trees; and the larch is
            now generally confined to barren and exposed ground. There the plant, which is a hardy
            one, is of slower growth; much less liable to injury; and the timber is of better
            quality. But the circumstances of many permit, and their taste leads them, to plant with
            little regard to profit; and there are others, less wealthy, who have such a lively
            feeling of the native beauty of these scenes, that they are laudably not unwilling to
            make some sacrifices to heighten it. Both these classes of persons, I would entreat to
            inquire of themselves wherein that beauty which they admire consists. They would then
            see that, after the feeling has been gratified that prompts us to gather round our
            dwelling a few flowers and shrubs, which from the circumstance of their not being
            native, may, by their very looks, remind us that they owe their existence to our hands,
            and their prosperity to our care; they will see that, after this natural desire has been
            provided for, the course of all beyond has been predetermined by the spirit of the
            place. Before I proceed, I will remind those who are not satisfied with the restraint
            thus laid upon them, that they are liable to a charge of inconsistency, when they are so
            eager to change the face of that country, whose native attractions, by the act of
            erecting their habitations in it, they have so emphatically acknowledged. And surely
            there is not a single spot that would not have, if well managed, sufficient dignity to
            support itself, <pb rend="none"/> unaided by the productions of other climates, or by elaborate
            decorations which might be becoming elsewhere. </p>
                  <p>Having adverted to the feelings that justify the introduction of a few exotic plants,
            provided they be confined almost to the doors of the house, we may add that a transition
            should be contrived, without abruptness, from these foreigners to the rest of the
            shrubs, which ought to be of the kinds scattered by Nature, through the
            woods—holly, broom, wild-rose, elder, dogberry, white and black thorn,
            &amp;.—either these only, or such as are carefully selected in consequence of
            their being united in form, and harmonising in colour with them, especially with respect
            to colour, when the tints are most diversified, as in autumn and spring. The various
            sorts of fruit-and-blossom-bearing trees usually found in orchards, to which may be
            added those of the woods—namely, the wilding, black cherry tree, and <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n131.html">wild cluster-cherry (here called heck-berry)</ref>—may be happily
            admitted as an intermediate link between the shrubs and the forest trees; which last
            ought almost entirely to be such as are natives of the country. Of the birch, one of the
            most beautiful of the native trees, it may be noticed that, in dry and rocky situations,
            it outstrips even the larch, which many persons are tempted to plant merely on account
            of the speed of its growth. The Scotch fir is less attractive during its youth than any
            other plant; but, when full-grown, if it has had room to spread out its <pb rend="none"/> arms, it
            becomes a noble tree; and, by those who are disinterested enough to plant for posterity,
            it may be placed along with the sycamore near the house; for, from their massiveness,
            both these trees unite well with buildings, and in some situations with rocks also;
            having, in their forms and apparent substances, the effect of something intermediate
            betwixt the immoveableness and solidity of stone, and the spray and foliage of the
            lighter trees. If these general rules be just, what shall we say to whole acres of
            artificial shrubbery and exotic trees among rocks and dashing torrents, with their own
            wild wood in sight —where we have the whole contents of the nurseryman's catalogue
            jumbled together—colour at war with colour, and form with form?—among the
            most peaceful subjects of Nature's kingdom, everywhere discord, distraction, and
            bewilderment! But this deformity, bad as it is, is not so obtrusive as the small patches
            and large tracts of larch-plantations that are overrunning the hill sides. To justify
            our condemnation of these, let us again recur to Nature. The process by which she forms
            woods and forests is as follows. Seeds are scattered indiscriminately by winds, brought
            by waters, and dropped by birds. They perish, or produce, according as the soil and
            situation upon which they fall are suited to them: and under the same dependence, the
            seedling or the sucker, if not cropped by animals (which Nature is often careful to
            prevent by fencing it <pb rend="none"/> about with brambles or other prickly shrubs) thrives, and
            the tree grows, sometimes single, taking its own shape without constraint, but for the
            most part compelled to conform itself to some law imposed upon it by its neighbours.
            From low and sheltered places, vegetation travels upwards to the more exposed; and the
            young plants are protected, and to a certain degree fashioned, by those that have
            preceded them. The continuous mass of foliage which would be thus produced, is broken by
            rocks, or by glades or open places, where the browzing of animals has prevented the
            growth of wood. As vegetation ascends, the winds begin also to bear their part in
            moulding the forms of the trees; but, thus mutually protected, trees, though not of the
            hardiest kind, are enabled to climb high up the mountains. Gradually, however, by the
            quality of the ground, and by increasing exposure, a stop is put to their ascent; the
            hardy trees only are left: those also, by little and little, give way—and a wild
            and irregular boundary is established, graceful in its outline, and never contemplated
            without some feeling, more or less distinct, of the powers of Nature by which it is
            imposed.</p>
                  <p>Contrast the liberty that encourages, and the law that limits, this joint work of
            nature and time, with the disheartening necessities, restrictions, and disadvantages,
            under which the artificial planter must proceed, even he whom long observation and fine
            feeling have best qualified for his task. In the first place his trees, how<!-- - --><pb rend="none"/>ever
            well chosen and adapted to their several situations, must generally start all at the
            same time; and this necessity would of itself prevent that fine connection of parts,
            that sympathy and organization, if I may so express myself, which pervades the whole of
            a natural wood, and appears to the eye in its single trees, its masses of foliage, and
            their various colours, when they are held up to view on the side of a mountain; or when,
            spread over a valley, they are looked down upon from an eminence. It is therefore
            impossible, under any circumstances, for the artificial planter to rival the beauty of
            nature. But a moment's thought will show that, if ten thousand of this spiky tree, the
            larch, are stuck in at once upon the side of a hill, they can grow up into nothing but
            deformity; that, while they are suffered to stand, we shall look in vain for any of
            those appearances which are the chief sources of beauty in a natural wood. </p>
                  <p>It must be acknowledged that the larch, till it has outgrown the size of a shrub,
            shows, when looked at singly, some elegance in form and appearance, especially in
            spring, decorated, as it then is, by the <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n132.html">pink tassels of its
              blossoms</ref>; but, as a tree, it is less than any other pleasing: its branches (for
              <emph>boughs</emph> it has none) have no variety in the youth of the tree,
            and little dignity, even when it attains its full growth; <emph>leaves</emph>
            it cannot be said to have, consequently neither affords shade nor shelter. In spring the
            larch becomes green long before <pb rend="none"/> the native trees; and its green is so peculiar and
            vivid, that, finding nothing to harmonize with it, wherever it comes forth, a
            disagreeable speck is produced. In summer, when all other trees are in their pride, it
            is of a dingy lifeless hue; <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n133.html">in autumn of a spiritless unvaried
              yellow</ref>, and in winter it is still more lamentably distinguished from every other
            deciduous tree of the forest, for they seem only to sleep, but the larch appears
            absolutely dead. If an attempt be made to mingle thickets, or a certain proportion of
            other forest-trees, with the larch, its horizontal branches intolerantly cut them down
            as with a scythe, or force them to spindle up to keep pace with it. The terminating
            spike renders it impossible that the several trees, where planted in numbers, should
            ever blend together so as to form a mass or masses of wood. Add thousands to tens of
            thousands, and the appearance is still the same —a collection of separate
            individual trees, obstinately presenting themselves as such; and which, from whatever
            point they are looked at, if but seen, may be counted upon the fingers. Sunshine, or
            shadow, has little power to adorn the surface of such a wood; and the trees not carrying
            up their heads, the wind raises among them no majestic undulations. It is indeed true,
            that, in countries where the larch is a native, and where, without interruption, it may
            sweep from valley to valley, and from hill to hill, a sublime image may be produced by
            such a forest, in the same manner as <pb rend="none"/> by one composed of any other single tree, to
            the spreading of which no limits can be assigned. For sublimity will never be wanting,
            where the sense of innumerable multitude is lost in, and alternates with, that of
            intense unity; and to the ready perception of this effect, similarity and almost
            identity of individual form and monotony of colour contribute. But this feeling is
            confined to the native immeasurable forest; no artificial plantation can give it. </p>
                  <p>The foregoing observations will, I hope, (as nothing has been condemned or recommended
            without a substantial reason) have some influence upon those who plant for ornament
            merely. To such as plant for profit, I have already spoken. Let me then entreat that the
            native deciduous trees may be left in complete possession of the lower ground; and that
            plantations of larch, if introduced at all, may be confined to the highest and most
            barren tracts. Interposition of rocks would there break the dreary uniformity of which
            we have been complaining; and the winds would take hold of the trees, and imprint upon
            their shapes a wildness congenial to their situation. </p>
                  <p>Having determined what kinds of trees must be wholly rejected, or at least very
            sparingly used, by those who are unwilling to disfigure the country; and having shown
            what kinds ought to be chosen; I should have given, if my limits had not already been
            overstepped, a few practical rules for the manner in which trees <pb rend="none"/> ought to be
            disposed in planting. But to this subject I should attach little importance, if I could
            succeed in banishing such trees as introduce deformity, and could prevail upon the
            proprietor to confine himself, either to those found in the native woods, or to such as
            accord with them. This is, indeed, the main point; for, much as these scenes have been
            injured by what has been taken from them —buildings, trees, and woods, either
            through negligence, necessity, avarice, or caprice —it is not the removals, but
            the harsh <emph>additions</emph> that have been made, which are the worst
            grievance— a standing and unavoidable annoyance. Often have I felt this
            distinction, with mingled satisfaction and regret; for, if no positive deformity or
            discordance be substituted or superinduced, such is the benignity of Nature, that, take
            away from her beauty after beauty, and ornament after ornament, her appearance cannot be
            marred——the scars, if any be left, will gradually disappear before a healing
            spirit; and what remains will still be soothing and pleasing.—</p>

                  <p>There are few ancient woods left in this part of England upon which such indiscriminate
            <pb rend="none"/> ravage as is here "deplored," could now be committed. But, out of the numerous
            copses, fine woods might in time be raised, probably without sacrifice of profit, by
            leaving, at the periodical fellings, a due proportion of the healthiest trees to grow up
            into timber.— This plan has fortunately, in many instances, been adopted; and
            they, who have set the example, are entitled to the thanks of all persons of taste. As
            to the management of planting with reasonable attention to ornament, let the images of
            nature be your guide, and the whole secret lurks in a few words; thickets or
            underwoods—single trees—trees clustered or in
            groups—groves—unbroken woods, but with varied masses of
            foliage—glades—invisible or winding boundaries—in rocky districts, a
            seemly proportion of rock left wholly bare, and other parts half
            hidden—disagreeable objects concealed, and formal lines broken —trees
            climbing up to the horizon, and, in some places, ascending from its sharp edge, in which
            they are rooted, with the whole body of the tree appearing to stand in the clear sky
            —in other parts, woods surmounted by rocks utterly bare and naked, which add to
            the sense of height, as if vegetation could not thither be carried, and impress a
            feeling of duration, power of resistance, and security from change! </p>
                  <anchor xml:id="para93"/>
                  <p>The author has been induced to speak thus at length, by a wish to preserve the native
            beauty of this delightful district, because still further changes in its appearance must
            inevi<!-- - --><pb rend="none"/>tably follow, from the change of inhabitants and owners which is rapidly
            taking place.—About the same time that strangers began to be attracted to the
            country, and to feel a desire to settle in it, the difficulty, that would have stood in
            the way of their procuring situations, was lessened by an unfortunate alteration in the
            circumstances of the native peasantry, proceeding from a cause which then began to
            operate, and is now felt in every house. The family of each man, whether <emph>estatesman</emph> or farmer, formerly had a twofold support; first, the
            produce of his lands and flocks; and, secondly, the profit drawn from the employment of
            the women and children, as manufacturers; spinning their own wool in their own houses
            (work chiefly done in the winter season), and carrying it to market for sale. Hence,
            however numerous the children, the income of the family kept pace with its increase.
            But, by the invention and universal application of machinery, this second resource has
            been cut off; the gains being so far reduced, as not to be sought after but by a few
            aged persons disabled from other employment. Doubtless, the invention of machinery has
            not been to these people a pure loss; for the profits arising from home-manufactures
            operated as a strong temptation to choose that mode of labour in neglect of husbandry.
            They also participate in the general benefit which the island has derived from the
            increased value of the produce of land, brought about by the estab<!-- - --><pb rend="none"/>lishment of
            manufactories, and in the consequent quickening of agricultural industry. But this is
            far from making them amends; and now that home-manufactures are nearly done away, though
            the women and children might, at many seasons of the year, employ themselves with
            advantage in the fields beyond what they are accustomed to do, yet still all possible
            exertion in this way cannot be rationally expected from persons whose agricultural
            knowledge is so confined, and, above all, where there must necessarily be so small a
            capital. The consequence, then, is—that proprietors and farmers being no longer
            able to maintain themselves upon small farms, several are united in one, and the
            buildings go to decay or are destroyed; and that the lands of the <emph>estatesmen</emph> being mortgaged, and the owners constrained to part with them, they
            fall into the hands of wealthy purchasers, who in like manner unite and consolidate;
            and, if they wish to become residents, erect new mansions out of the ruins of the
            ancient cottages, whose little enclosures, with all the wild graces that grew out of
            them, disappear. The feudal tenure under which the estates are held has indeed done
            something towards checking this influx of new settlers; but so strong is the
            inclination, that these galling restraints are endured; and it is probable, that in a
            few years the country on the margin of the Lakes will fall almost entirely into the
            possession of gentry, either strangers or natives. It is then <pb rend="none"/> much to be wished,
            that a better taste should prevail among these new proprietors; and, as they cannot be
            expected to leave things to themselves, that skill and knowledge should prevent
            unnecessary deviations from that path of simplicity and beauty along which, without
            design and unconsciously, their humble predecessors have moved. In this wish the author
            will be joined by persons of pure taste throughout the whole island, who, by their
            visits (often repeated) to the Lakes in the North of England, testify that they deem the
            district <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n135.html">a sort of national property</ref>, in which every man has a
            right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy.<pb rend="none"/>

                     <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n136.html">MR. WEST</ref>, in his well-known Guide to the Lakes, recommends,
            as the best season for visiting this country, the interval from the beginning of June to
            the end of August; and, the two latter months being a time of vacation and leisure, it
            is almost exclusively in these that strangers resort hither. But that season is by no
            means the best; the colouring of the mountains and woods, unless where they are
            diversified by rocks, is of too unvaried a green; and, as a large portion of the vallies
            is allotted to hay-grass, some want of variety is found there also. The meadows,
            however, are sufficiently enlivened after hay-making begins, which is much later than in
            the southern part of the island. A stronger objection is rainy weather, setting in
            sometimes at this period with a vigour, and continuing with a perseverance, that may
            remind the disappointed and dejected traveller <pb rend="none"/> of those deluges of rain which fall
            among the Abyssinian mountains, for the annual supply of the Nile. The months of
            September and October (particularly October) are generally attended with much finer
            weather; and the scenery is then, beyond comparison, more diversified, more splendid,
            and beautiful; but, on the other hand, short days prevent long excursions, and sharp and
            chill gales are unfavourable to parties of pleasure out of doors. Nevertheless, to the
            sincere admirer of nature, who is in good health and spirits, and at liberty to make a
            choice, the six weeks following the 1st of September may be recommended in preference to
            July and August. For there is no inconvenience arising from the season which, to such a
            person, would not be amply compensated by the <emph>autumnal</emph>
            appearance of any of the more retired vallies, into which discordant plantations and
            unsuitable buildings have not yet found entrance.—In such spots, at this season,
            there is an admirable compass and proportion of natural harmony in colour, through the
            whole scale of objects; in the tender green of the after-grass upon the meadows,
            interspersed with islands of grey or mossy rock, crowned by shrubs and trees; in the
            irregular inclosures of standing corn, or stubble-fields, in like manner broken; in the
            mountain-sides glowing with fern of divers colours; in the calm blue lakes and
            river-pools; and in the foliage of the trees, through all the tints of
            autumn,—from the pale and brilliant yellow <pb rend="none"/> of the birch and ash, to the deep
            greens of the unfaded oak and alder, and of the ivy upon the rocks, upon the trees, and
            the cottages. Yet, as most travellers are either stinted, or stint themselves, for time,
            the space between the middle or last week in May, and the middle or last week of June,
            may be pointed out as affording the best combination of long days, fine weather, and
            variety of impressions. Few of the native trees are then in full leaf; but, for whatever
            may be wanting in depth of shade, more than an equivalent will be found in the diversity
            of foliage, in the blossoms of the fruit-and-berry-bearing trees which abound in the
            woods, and in the golden flowers of the broom and other shrubs, with which many of the
            copses are interveined. In those woods, also, and on these mountain sides which have a
            northern aspect, and in the deep dells, many of the spring-flowers still linger; while
            the open and sunny places are stocked with the flowers of the approaching summer. And,
            besides, is not an exquisite pleasure still untasted by him who has not heard the choir
            of linnets and thrushes chaunting their love-songs in the copses, woods, and hedge-rows
            of a mountainous country; safe from the birds of prey, which build in the inaccessible
            crags, and are at all hours seen or heard wheeling about in the air? The number of these
            formidable creatures is probably the cause why, in the <emph>narrow</emph>
            vallies, there are no skylarks; as the destroyer would be enabled to <pb rend="none"/> dart upon
            them from the near and surrounding crags, before they could descend to their
            ground-nests for protection. <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n137.html">It is not often that the nightingale
              resorts to these vales</ref>; but almost all the other tribes of our English warblers
            are numerous; and their notes, when listened to by the side of broad still waters, or
            when heard in unison with the murmuring of mountain-brooks, have the compass of their
            power enlarged accordingly. There is also an imaginative influence in the voice of the
            cuckoo, when that voice has taken possession of a deep mountain valley, very different
            from any thing which can be excited by the same sound in a flat country. Nor must a
            circumstance be omitted, which here renders the close of spring especially interesting;
            I mean the practice of bringing down the ewes from the mountains to <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n138.html">yean</ref> in the vallies and enclosed grounds. The herbage being thus cropped as it
            springs, <emph>that</emph> first tender emerald green of the season, which
            would otherwise have lasted little more than a fortnight, is prolonged in the pastures
            and meadows for many weeks: while they are farther enlivened by the multitude of lambs
            bleating and skipping about. These sportive creatures, as they gather strength, are
            turned out upon the open mountains, and with their slender limbs, their snow-white
            colour, and their wild and light motions, beautifully accord or contrast with the rocks
            and lawns, upon which they must now begin to seek their food. And last, but not least,
            at this time the traveller <pb rend="none"/> will be sure of room and comfortable accommodation,
            even in the smaller inns. I am aware that few of those who may be inclined to profit by
            this recommendation will be able to do so, as the time and manner of an excursion of
            this kind are mostly regulated by circumstances which prevent an entire freedom of
            choice. It will therefore be more pleasant to observe, that, though the months of July
            and August are liable to many objections, yet it often happens that the weather, at this
            time, is not more wet and stormy than they, who are really capable of enjoying the
            sublime forms of nature in their utmost sublimity, would desire. For no traveller,
            provided he be in good health, and with any command of time, would have a just privilege
            to visit such scenes, if he could grudge the price of a little confinement among them,
            or interruption in his journey, for the sight or sound of a storm coming on or clearing
            away. Insensible must he be who would not congratulate himself upon the bold bursts of
            sunshine, the descending vapours, wandering lights and shadows, and the invigorated
            torrents and water-falls, with which broken weather, in a mountainous region, is
            accompanied. At such a time there is no cause to complain, either of the monotony of
            midsummer colouring, or the glaring atmosphere of long, cloudless, and hot days. </p>
                  <p>Thus far concerning the respective advantages and disadvantages of the different
            seasons for visiting this country. As to the order <pb rend="none"/> in which objects are best
            seen—a lake being composed of water flowing from higher grounds, and expanding
            itself till its receptacle is filled to the brim,—it follows, that it will appear
            to most advantage when approached from its outlet, especially if the lake be in a
            mountainous country; for, by this way of approach, the traveller faces the grander
            features of the scene, and is gradually conducted into its most sublime recesses. Now,
            every one knows, that from amenity and beauty the transition to sublimity is easy and
            favourable; but the reverse is not so; for, after the faculties have been elevated, they
            are indisposed to humbler excitement. <note resp="author" place="foot"> The only instances to which
              the foregoing observations do not apply, are Derwent-water and Lowes-water. Derwent is
              distinguished from all the other Lakes by being <emph>surrounded</emph>
              with sublimity: the fantastic mountains of Borrowdale to the south, the solitary
              majesty of Skiddaw to the north, the bold steeps of Wallow-crag and Lodore to the
              east, and to the west the clustering mountains of New-lands. Lowes-water is tame at
              the head, but towards its outlet has a magnificent assemblage of mountains. Yet as far
              as respects the formation of such receptacles, the general observation holds good:
              neither Derwent nor Lowes-water derive any supplies from the streams of those
              mountains that dignify the landscape towards the outlets.</note>

                  <p>It is not likely that a mountain will be ascended without disappointment, if a wide
            range of prospect be the object, unless either the summit be reached before sun-rise, or
            the visitant remain there until the time of sun-set, and afterwards. The precipitous
            sides of the mountain, and the neighbouring summits, may <pb rend="none"/> be seen with effect under
            any atmosphere which allows them to be seen at all; but <emph>he</emph> is
            the most fortunate adventurer, who chances to be involved in vapours which open and let
            in an extent of country partially, or, dispersing suddenly, reveal the whole region from
            centre to circumference. </p>
                  <p>A stranger to a mountainous country may not be aware that his walk in the early morning
            ought to be taken on the eastern side of the vale, otherwise he will lose the morning
            light, first touching the tops and thence creeping down the sides of the opposite hills,
            as the sun ascends, or he may go to some central eminence, commanding both the shadows
            from the eastern, and the lights upon the western mountains. But, if the horizon line in
            the east be low, the western side may be taken for the sake of the reflections, upon the
            water, of light from the rising sun. In the evening, for like reasons, the contrary
            course should be taken. </p>
                  <p>After all, it is upon the <emph>mind</emph> which a traveller brings along
            with him that his acquisitions, whether of pleasure or profit, must principally
            depend.—May I be allowed a few words on this subject? </p>
                  <p> Nothing is more injurious to genuine feeling than the practice of hastily and
            ungraciously depreciating the face of one country by comparing it with that of another.
            True it is <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n139.html">Qui <emph>bene</emph> distinguit bene <emph>docet</emph>
                     </ref>; yet fastidiousness is a wretched travelling
            companion; and the best guide to which, in matters of taste we can en<!-- - --><pb rend="none"/>trust
            ourselves, is a disposition to be pleased. For example, if a traveller be among the
            Alps, let him surrender up his mind to the fury of the gigantic torrents, and take
            delight in the contemplation of their almost irresistible violence, without complaining
            of the monotony of their foaming course, or being disgusted with the muddiness of the
            water—apparent even where it is violently agitated. In Cumberland and Westmorland,
            let not the comparative weakness of the streams prevent him from sympathising with such
            impetuosity as they possess; and, making the most of the present objects, let him, as he
            justly may do, observe with admiration the unrivalled brilliancy of the water, and that
            variety of motion, mood, and character, that arises out of the want of those resources
            by which the power of the streams in the Alps is supported.— Again, with respect
            to the mountains; though these are comparatively of diminutive size, though there is
            little of perpetual snow, and no voice of summer-avalanches is heard among them; and
            though traces left by the ravage of the elements are here comparatively rare and
            unimpressive, yet out of this very deficiency proceeds a sense of stability and
            permanence that is, to many minds, more grateful—
          <quote>"<ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n140.html">While the coarse rushes to the sweeping<lb/> breeze Sigh forth their
              ancient melodies</ref>."</quote>
          Among the Alps are few places that do not preclude this feeling of tranquil sublimity.
            <pb rend="none"/> Havoc, and ruin, and desolation, and encroachment, are everywhere more or less
            obtruded; and it is difficult, notwithstanding the naked loftiness of the <emph>pikes</emph>, and the snow-capped summits of the <emph>mounts</emph>, to escape from the depressing sensation, that the whole are in a rapid
            process of dissolution; and, were it not that the destructive agency must abate as the
            heights diminish, would, in time to come, be levelled with the plains. Nevertheless, I
            would relish to the utmost the demonstrations of every species of power at work to
            effect such changes. </p>
                  <p> From these general views let us descend a moment to detail. A stranger to mountain
            imagery naturally on his first arrival looks out for sublimity in every object that
            admits of it; and is almost always disappointed. For this disappointment there exists, I
            believe, no general preventive; nor is it desirable that there should. But with regard
            to one class of objects, there is a point in which injurious expectations may be easily
            corrected. It is generally supposed that waterfalls are scarcely worth being looked at
            except after much rain, and that, the more swollen the stream, the more fortunate the
            spectator; but this however is true only of large cataracts with sublime accompaniments;
            and not even of these without some drawbacks. In other instances, what becomes, at such
            a time, of that sense of refreshing coolness which can only be felt in dry and sunny
            weather, when the rocks, herbs, <pb rend="none"/> and flowers glisten with moisture diffused by the
            breath of the precipitous water? But, considering these things as objects of sight only,
            it may be observed that the principal charm of the smaller waterfalls or cascades
            consists in certain proportions of form and affinities of colour, among the component
            parts of the scene; and in the contrast maintained between the falling water and that
            which is apparently at rest, or rather settling gradually into quiet in the pool below.
            The beauty of such a scene, where there is naturally so much agitation, is also
            heightened, in a peculiar manner, by the <emph>glimmering</emph>, and,
            towards the verge of the pool, by the <emph> steady</emph>, reflection of the
            surrounding images. Now, all those delicate distinctions are destroyed by heavy floods,
            and the whole stream rushes along in foam and tumultuous confusion. A happy proportion
            of component parts is indeed noticeable among the landscapes of the North of England;
            and, in this characteristic essential to a perfect picture, they surpass the scenes of
            Scotland, and, in a still greater degree, those of Switzerland. </p>
                  <p>As a resident among the Lakes, I frequently hear the scenery of this country compared
            with that of the Alps; and therefore a few words shall be added to what has been
            incidentally said upon that subject. </p>
                  <p>If we could recall, to this region of lakes, the native pine-forests, with which many
            hundred years ago a large portion of the heights <pb rend="none"/> was covered, then, during spring
            and autumn, it might frequently, with much propriety, be compared to
            Switzerland,—the elements of the landscape would be the same—one country
            representing the other in miniature. Towns, villages, churches, rural seats, bridges and
            roads: green meadows and arable grounds, with their various produce, and deciduous woods
            of diversified foliage which occupy the vales and lower regions of the mountains, would,
            as in Switzerland, be divided by dark forests from ridges and round-topped heights
            covered with snow, and from pikes and sharp declivities imperfectly arrayed in the same
            glittering mantle: and the resemblance would be still more perfect on those days when
            vapours, resting upon, and floating around the summits, leave the elevation of the
            mountains less dependent upon the eye than on the imagination. But the pine-forests have
            wholly disappeared; and only during late spring and early autumn is realized here that
            assemblage of the imagery of different seasons, which is exhibited through the whole
            summer among the Alps,—winter in the distance, —and warmth, leafy woods,
            verdure and fertility at hand, and widely diffused. </p>
                  <p>Striking, then, from among the permanent materials of the landscape, that stage of
            vegetation which is occupied by pine-forests, and, above that, the perennial snows, we
            have mountains, the highest of which little exceed <num>3000</num> feet, <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n141.html">while some of the Alps do not fall <pb rend="none"/> short of <num>14,000</num> or
                <num>15,000</num>
                     </ref>, and <num>8,000</num> or <num>10,000</num> is not an
            uncommon elevation. Our tracts of wood and water are almost as diminutive in comparison;
            therefore, as far as sublimity is dependent upon absolute bulk and height, and
            atmospherical influences in connection with these, it is obvious, that there can be no
            rivalship. But a short residence among the British Mountains will furnish abundant
            proof, that, after a certain point of elevation, viz. that which allows of compact and
            fleecy clouds settling upon, or sweeping over, the summits, the sense of sublimity
            depends more upon form and relation of objects to each other than upon their actual
            magnitude; and, that an elevation of <num>3000</num> feet is sufficient to call forth in
            a most impressive degree the creative, and magnifying, and softening powers of the
            atmosphere. Hence, on the score even of sublimity, the superiority of the Alps is by no
            means so great as might hastily be inferred;—and, as to the <emph>beauty</emph> of the lower regions of the Swiss Mountains, it is noticeable—that,
            as they are all regularly mown, their surface has nothing of that mellow tone and
            variety of hues by which mountain turf, that is never touched by the scythe, is
            distinguished. On the smooth and steep slopes of the Swiss hills, these plots of verdure
            do indeed agreeably unite their colour with that of the deciduous trees, or make a
            lively contrast with the dark green pine-groves that define them, and among which they
            run in endless variety of shapes <pb rend="none"/> —but this is most pleasing <emph>at first sight;</emph> the permanent gratification of the eye requires
            finer gradations of tone, and a more delicate blending of hues into each other. Besides,
            it is only in spring and late autumn that cattle animate by their presence the Swiss
            lawns; and, though the pastures of the higher regions where they feed during the summer
            are left in their natural state of flowery herbage, those pastures are so remote, that
            their texture and colour are of no consequence in the composition of any picture in
            which a lake of the Vales is a feature. Yet in those lofty regions, how vegetation is
            invigorated by the genial climate of that country! Among the luxuriant flowers there met
            with, groves, or forests, if I may so call them, of Monks-hood are frequently seen; the
            plant of deep, rich blue, and as tall as in our gardens; and this at an elevation where,
            in Cumberland, Icelandic moss would only be found, or the stony summits be utterly bare. </p>
                  <p> We have, then, for the colouring of Switzerland, <emph>principally</emph> a
            vivid green herbage, black woods, and dazzling snows, presented in masses with a
            grandeur to which no one can be insensible; but not often graduated by Nature into
            soothing harmony, and so ill suited to the pencil, that though abundance of good
            subjects may be there found, they are not such as can be deemed <emph>characteristic</emph> of the country; nor is this unfitness confined to colour: the
            forms of the mountains, though <pb rend="none"/> many of them in some points of view the noblest
            that can be conceived, are apt to run into spikes and needles, and present a jagged
            outline which has a mean effect, transferred to canvass. This must have been felt by the
            ancient masters; for, if I am not mistaken, they have not left a single landscape, the
            materials of which are taken from the <emph>peculiar</emph> features of the
            Alps; <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n142.html">yet Titian passed his life almost in their neighbourhood; the
              Poussins and Claude must have been well acquainted with their aspects; and several
              admirable painters, as Tibaldi and Luino, were born among the Italian Alps</ref>. A
            few experiments have lately been made by <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n143.html">Englishmen</ref>, but they
            only prove that courage, skill, and judgment, may surmount any obstacles; and it may be
            safely affirmed, that they who have done best in this bold adventure, will be the least
            likely to repeat the attempt. But, though our scenes are better suited to painting than
            those of the Alps, I should be sorry to contemplate either country in reference to that
            art, further than as its fitness or unfitness for the pencil renders it more or less
            pleasing to the eye of the spectator, who has learned to observe and feel, chiefly from
            Nature herself. </p>
                  <p>Deeming the points in which Alpine imagery is superior to British too obvious to be
            insisted upon, I will observe that the deciduous woods, though in many places
            unapproachable by the axe, and triumphing in the pomp and prodigality of Nature, have,
            in gene<!-- - --><pb rend="none"/>ral,<note resp="author" place="foot"> The greatest variety of trees is
              found in <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n144.html">the Valais</ref>.</note> neither the variety nor beauty
            which would exist in those of the mountains of Britain, if left to themselves.
            Magnificent walnut trees grow upon the plains of Switzerland; and fine trees, of that
            species, are found scattered over the hill-sides: birches also grow here and there in
            luxuriant beauty; but neither these, nor oaks, are ever a prevailing tree, nor can even
            be said to be common; and the oaks, as far as I had an opportunity of observing, are
            greatly inferior to those of Britain. Among the interior vallies the proportion of
            beeches and pines is so great that other trees are scarcely noticeable; and surely such
            woods are at all seasons much less agreeable than that rich and harmonious distribution
            of oak, ash, elm, birch, and alder, that formerly clothed the sides of Snowdon and
            Helvellyn; and of which no mean remains still survive at the head of Ulswater. On the
            Italian side of the Alps, chesnut and walnut trees grow at a considerable height on the
            mountains; but, even there, the foliage is not equal in beauty to the "natural product"
            of this climate. In fact the sunshine of the South of Europe, so envied when heard of at
            a distance, is in many respects injurious to rural beauty, particularly as it incites to
            the cultivation of spots of ground which in colder climates would be left in the hands
            of nature, favouring at the same time the culture of <pb rend="none"/> plants that are more valuable
            on account of the fruit they produce to gratify the palate, than for affording pleasure
            to the eye, as materials of landscape. Take, for instance, <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n145.html">the
              Promontory of Bellagio</ref>, so fortunate in its command of the three branches of the
            Lake of Como, yet the ridge of the Promontory itself, being for the most part covered
            with vines interspersed with olive trees, accords but ill with the vastness of the green
            unappropriated mountains, and derogates not a little from the sublimity of those finely
            contrasted pictures to which it is a fore-ground. The vine, when cultivated upon a large

            of a heavy green hue—as is that of all the other lakes, apparently according to
            the degree in which they are fed by melted snows. If the Lake of Geneva furnish an
            exception, this is probably owing to its vast extent, which allows the water to deposit
            its impurities. The water of the English lakes, on the contrary, being of a crystalline
            clearness, the reflections of the surrounding hills are frequently so lively, that it is
            scarcely possible to distinguish the point where the real object terminates, and its un
            substantial duplicate begins. The lower part of the Lake of Geneva, from its narrowness,
            must be much less subject to agitation than the higher divisions, and, as the water is
            clearer than that of the other Swiss Lakes, it will frequently exhibit this appearance,
            though it is scarcely possible in an equal degree. During <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n150.html">two
              comprehensive tours</ref> among the Alps, I did not observe, except on one of the
            smaller lakes, between Lugano and Ponte Tresa, a single instance of those beautiful
            repetitions <pb rend="none"/> of surrounding objects on the bosom of the water, which are so
            frequently seen here: not to speak of the fine dazzling trembling network, breezy
            motions, and streaks and circles of intermingled smooth and rippled water, which makes
            the surface of our lakes a field of endless variety. But among the Alps, where every
            thing tends to the grand and the sublime, in surfaces as well as in forms, if the lakes
            do not court the placid reflections of land objects those of first-rate magnitude make
            compensation, in some degree, by exhibiting those ever-changing fields of green, blue,
            and purple shadows or lights, (one scarcely knows which to name them) that call to mind
            a sea-prospect contemplated from a lofty cliff.</p>
                  <p>The subject of torrents and water-falls has already been touched upon; but it may be
            added that in Switzerland, the perpetual accompaniment of snow upon the higher regions
            takes much from the effect of foaming white streams; while, from their frequency, they
            obstruct each other's influence upon the mind of the spectator; and, in all cases, the
            effect of an individual cataract, excepting <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n151.html">the great Fall of the
              Rhine at Schaffhausen</ref>, is diminished by the general fury of the stream of which
            it is a part. </p>
                  <p>Recurring to the reflections from still water, I will describe a singular phenomenon of
            this kind of which I was an eye-witness. </p>
                  <p>Walking by the side of Ulswater upon a calm September morning, I saw, deep within <pb rend="none"/>
            the bosom of the lake, a magnificent Castle, with towers and battlements, nothing could
            be more distinct than the whole edifice;—after gazing with delight upon it for
            some time, as upon a work of enchantment, I could not but regret that my previous
            knowledge of the place enabled me to account for the appearance. It was in fact the
            reflection of a pleasure-house called <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n152.html">Lyulph's Tower</ref>—the
            towers and battlements magnified and so much changed in shape as not to be immediately
            recognized. In the meanwhile, the pleasure-house itself was altogether hidden from my
            view by a body of vapour stretching over it and along the hill-side on which it stands,
            but not so as to have intercepted its communication with the lake; and hence this novel
            and most impressive object, which, if I had been a stranger to the spot, would, from its
            being inexplicable, have long detained the mind in a state of pleasing astonishment. </p>
                  <p>Appearances of this kind, acting upon the credulity of early ages, may have given birth
            to, and favoured the belief in, stories of subaqueous palaces, gardens, and
            pleasure-grounds—the brilliant ornaments of Romance. </p>
                  <p>With this <emph> inverted</emph> scene I will couple a much more
            extraordinary phenomenon, which will show how other elegant fancies may have had their
            origin, less in invention than in the actual processes of nature. </p>
                  <p>About eleven o'clock on the forenoon of a winter's day, coming suddenly, in company of
            <pb rend="none"/> a friend, into view of the Lake of Grasmere, we were alarmed by the sight of a
            newly-created Island; the transitory thought of the moment was, that it had been
            produced by an earthquake or some other convulsion of nature. Recovering from the alarm,
            which was greater than the reader can possibly sympathize with, but which was shared to
            its full extent by my companion, we proceeded to examine the object before us. The
            elevation of this new island exceeded considerably that of the old one, its neighbour;
            it was likewise larger in circumference, comprehending a space of about five acres; its
            surface rocky, speckled with snow, and sprinkled over with birch trees; it was divided
            towards the south from the other island by a narrow frith, and in like manner from the
            northern shore of the lake; on the east and west it was separated from the shore by a
            much larger space of smooth water. </p>
                  <p>Marvellous was the illusion! Comparing the new with the old Island, the surface of
            which is soft, green, and unvaried, I do not scruple to say that, as an object of sight,
            it was much the more distinct. "How little faith," we exclaimed, "is due to one sense,
            unless its evidence be confirmed by some of its fellows! What Stranger could possibly be
            persuaded that this, which we know to be an unsubstantial mockery, is <emph>really</emph> so; and that there exists only a single Island on this beautiful Lake?"
            At length the appearance underwent a gradual transmutation; it lost its prominence and
            pass<!-- - --><pb rend="none"/>ed into a glimmering and dim <emph>inversion</emph>, and then
            totally disappeared;—leaving behind it a clear open area of ice of the same
            dimensions. We now perceived that this bed of ice, which was thinly suffused with water,
            had produced the illusion, by reflecting and refracting (as persons skilled in optics
            would no doubt easily explain) a rocky and woody section of the opposite mountain named
            Silver-how. </p>
                  <p>Having dwelt so much upon the beauty of pure and still water, and pointed out the
            advantage which the Lakes of the North of England have in this particular over those of
            the Alps, it would be injustice not to advert to the sublimity that must often be given
            to Alpine scenes, by the agitations to which those vast bodies of diffused water are
            there subject. I have witnessed many tremendous thunder-storms among the Alps, and the
            most glorious effects of light and shadow; but I never happened to be present when any
            Lake was agitated by those hurricanes which I imagine must often torment them. If the
            commotions be at all proportionable to the expanse and depth of the waters, and the
            height of the surrounding mountains, then, if I may judge from what is frequently seen
            here, the exhibition must be awful and astonishing.—On this day, <date>March 30,
              1822</date>, the winds have been acting upon the small Lake of Rydal, as if they had
            received command to carry its waters from their bed into the sky; the white billows in
            different quarters disappeared under clouds, or rather <pb rend="none"/> drifts, of spray, that were
            whirled along, and up into the air by scouring winds, charging each other in squadrons
            in every direction, upon the Lake. The spray, having been hurried aloft till it lost its
            consistency and whiteness, was driven along the mountain tops like flying showers that
            vanish in the distance. Frequently an eddying wind scooped the waters out of the basin,
            and forced them upwards in the very shape of an Icelandic Geyser, or boiling fountain,
            to the height of several hundred feet. </p>
                  <p>This small Mere of Rydal, from its position, is subject in a peculiar degree to these
            commotions. The present season, however, is unusually stormy;— great numbers of
            fish, two of them not less than <num>12</num> pounds weight, were a few days ago cast on
            the shores of Derwent-water by the force of the waves. </p>
                  <anchor xml:id="para116"/>
                  <p>Lest, in the foregoing comparative estimate, I should be suspected of partiality to my
            native mountains, I will support my general opinion by the authority of Mr. West, whose
            Guide to the Lakes has been eminently serviceable to the Tourist for nearly
              <num>50</num> years. The Author, a Roman Catholic clergyman, had passed much time
            abroad, and was well acquainted with the scenery of the Continent. He thus expresses
            himself: "They who intend to make the continental tour should begin here; as it will
            give, in miniature, an idea of what they are to meet with there, in traversing the Alps
            and Appenines; to which our northern <pb rend="none"/> mountains are not inferior in beauty of line,
            or variety of summit, number of lakes, and transparency of water; not in colouring of
            rock, or softness of turf; but in height and extent only. The mountains here are all
            accessible to the summit, and furnish prospects no less surprising, and with more
            variety, than the Alps themselves. The tops of the highest Alps are inaccessible, being
            covered with everlasting snow, which commencing at regular heights above the cultivated
            tracts, or wooded and verdant sides, form indeed the highest contrast in nature. For
            there may be seen all the variety of climate in one view. To this, however, we oppose
            the sight of the ocean, from the summits of all the higher mountains, as it appears
            intersected with promontaries, decorated with islands, and animated with
            navigation."—West's <emph>Guide</emph>, p. <num>5</num>. </p>

                  <p>It was my intention, several years ago, to describe a regular tour through this
            country, taking the different scenes in the most favour<!-- - --><pb rend="none"/>able order; but after
            some progress had been made in <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n153.html">the work</ref> it was abandoned from
            a conviction, that, if well executed, it would lessen the pleasure of the Traveller by
            anticipation, and, if the contrary, it would mislead him. The Reader may not, however,
            be displeased with the following <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n154.html">extract from a letter to a
              Friend</ref>, giving an account of a visit to a summit of one of the highest of these
            mountains; of which I am reminded by the observations of Mr. West, and by reviewing what
            has been said of this district in comparison with the Alps. </p>
                  <p>Having left Rosthwaite in Borrowdale, on a bright morning in the first week of October,
            we ascended from <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n155.html">Seathwaite</ref> to the top of the ridge, called
            Ash-course, and thence beheld three distinct views—on one side, the continuous
            Vale of Borrowdale, Keswick, and Bassenthwaite,—with Skiddaw, Helvellyn,
            Saddle-back, and numerous other mountains, —and, in the distance, the Solway Frith
            and the Mountains of Scotland;—on the other side, and below us, the Langdale
            Pikes—their own vale below <emph> them</emph>;—
            Windermere,—and, far beyond Windermere, Ingleborough in Yorkshire. But how shall I
            speak of the deliciousness of the third prospect! At this time, <emph>
              that</emph> was most favoured by sunshine and shade. The green Vale of Esk—deep
            and green, with its glittering serpent stream, lay below us; and, on we looked to the
            Mountains near the Sea,—Black Comb pre-eminent,—and, still <pb rend="none"/> beyond, to
            the Sea itself, in dazzling brightness. Turning round we saw the Mountains of Wastdale
            in tumult; to our right, Great Gavel, the loftiest, a distinct, and <emph>huge</emph> form, though the middle of the mountain was, to our eyes, as its base. </p>
                  <p>We had attained <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n156.html">the object of this journey</ref>; but our ambition
            now mounted higher. We saw the summit of Scaw-fell, apparently very near to us; and we
            shaped our course towards it; but, discovering that it could not be reached without
            first making a considerable descent, we resolved, instead, to aim at another point of
            the same mountain, called <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n157.html">the <emph> Pikes</emph>
                     </ref>,
            which I have since found has been estimated as higher than the summit bearing the name
            of Scawfell Head, where <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n158.html">the Stone Man</ref> is built. </p>
                  <p>The sun had never once been overshadowed by a cloud during the whole of our progress
            from the centre of Borrowdale. On the summit of the Pike, which we gained after much
            toil, though without difficulty, there was not a breath of air to stir even the papers
            containing our refreshment, as they lay spread out upon a rock. The stillness seemed to
            be not of this world:—we paused, and kept silence to listen; and no sound could be
            heard: the Scawfell Cataracts were voiceless to us; and there was not an insect to hum
            in the air. The vales which we had seen from Ash-course lay yet in view; and, side by
            side with Eskdale, we now saw the sister Vale of Donnerdale terminated by the Duddon
            Sands. But <pb rend="none"/> the majesty of the mountains below, and close to us, is not to be
            conceived. We now beheld the whole mass of <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n159.html">Great Gavel</ref> from
            its base,—the Den of Wastdale at our feet—a gulph immeasurable: Grasmire and
            the other mountains of Crummock—Ennerdale and its mountains; and the Sea beyond!
            We sat down to our repast, and gladly would we have tempered our beverage (for there was
            no spring or well near us) with such a supply of delicious water as we might have
            procured, had we been on the rival summit of Great Gavel; for on its highest point is a
            small triangular receptacle in the native rock, which, the shepherds say, is never dry.
            There we might have slaked our thirst plenteously with a pure and celestial liquid, for
            the cup or basin, it appears, has no other feeder than the dews of heaven, the showers,
            the vapours, the hoar frost, and the spotless snow. </p>
                  <p>While we were gazing around, "Look," I exclaimed, "at yon ship upon the glittering
            sea!" "Is it a ship?" replied our shepherd-guide. "It can be nothing else," interposed
            my companion; "I cannot be mistaken, I am so accustomed to the appearance of ships at
            sea." The Guide dropped the argument; but, before a minute was gone, he quietly said,
            "Now look at your ship; it is changed into a horse." So indeed it was,—a horse
            with a gallant neck and head. We laughed heartily; and, I hope, when again inclined to
            be positive, I may remember the ship and the <pb rend="none"/> horse upon the glittering sea; and
            the calm confidence, yet submissiveness, of our wise Man of the Mountains, who certainly
            had more knowledge of clouds than we, whatever might be our knowledge of ships. </p>
                  <p>I know not how long we might have remained on the summit of the Pike, without a thought
            of moving, had not our Guide warned us that we must not linger; for a storm was coming.
            We looked in vain to espy the signs of it. Mountains, vales, and sea were touched with
            the clear light of the sun. "It is there," said he, pointing to the sea beyond
            Whitehaven, and there we perceived a light vapour unnoticeable but by a shepherd
            accustomed to watch all mountain bodings. We gazed around again, and yet again,
            unwilling to lose the remembrance of what lay before us in that lofty solitude; and then
            prepared to depart. Meanwhile the air changed to cold, and we saw that <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n160.html">tiny vapour swelled into mighty masses of cloud</ref> which came
            boiling over the mountains. Great Gavel, Helvellyn, and Skiddaw, were wrapped in storm;
            yet Langdale, and the mountains in that quarter, remained all bright in sunshine. Soon
            the storm reached us; we sheltered under a crag; and almost as rapidly as it had come it
            passed away, and left us free to observe the struggles of gloom and sunshine in other
            quarters. Langdale now had its share, and the Pikes of Langdale were decorated by two
            splendid rainbows. Skiddaw also had his own rainbows. Before we <pb rend="none"/> again reached
            Ash-course every cloud had vanished from every summit. </p>
                  <p>I ought to have mentioned that round the top of Scawfell-PIKE not a blade of grass is
            to be seen. Cushions or tufts of moss, parched and brown, appear between the <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n161.html">huge blocks and stones that lie in heaps</ref> on all sides to a great
            distance, like skeletons or bones of the earth not needed at the creation, and there
            left to be covered with <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n162.html">never-dying lichens</ref>, which the clouds
            and dews nourish; and adorn with colours of vivid and exquisite beauty. Flowers, the
            most brilliant feathers, and even gems, scarcely surpass in colouring some of those
            masses of stone, which no human eye beholds, except the shepherd or traveller be led
            thither by curiosity: and how seldom must this happen! For the other eminence is the one
            visited by the adventurous stranger; and the shepherd has no inducement to ascend the
            PIKE in quest of his sheep; no food being <emph> there</emph> to tempt them. </p>
                  <p>We certainly were singularly favoured in the weather; for when we were seated on the
            summit, our conductor, turning his eyes thoughtfully round, said, "I do not know that in
            my whole life, I was ever, at any season of the year, so high upon the mountains on so
              <emph>calm</emph> a day." (It was the <date>7th of October</date>.)
            Afterwards we had a spectacle of the grandeur of earth and heaven commingled; yet
            without terror. We knew that the storm would pass away;—for so our prophetic Guide
            had assured us.<pb rend="none"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before we reached Seathwaite in Borrowdale, a few stars had appeared, and we pursued
            our way down the Vale, to Rosthwaite, by moonlight. </p>
                  <p>Scawfell and Helvellyn being the two Mountains of this region which will best repay the
            fatigue of ascending them, the following Verses may be here introduced with propriety.
            They are from the Author's Miscellaneous Poems. </p>

            seldom seen but by the inhabitants. As <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n166.html">the journal was written for

            appearances are dwelt upon, which are produced by the changeableness of the atmosphere,

                     <date>A.D. 1805</date>.——On the <date>7th of November</date>, on a damp and
            gloomy morning, we left Grasmere Vale, intending to pass a few days on the banks of
            Ullswater. A mild and dry autumn had <pb rend="none"/> been unusually favourable to the preservation
            and beauty of foliage; and, far advanced as the season was, the trees on the larger
            Island of Rydal-mere retained a splendour which did not need the heightening of
            sunshine. We noticed, as we passed, that the line of the grey rocky shore of that
            island, shaggy with variegated bushes and shrubs, and spotted and striped with purplish
            brown heath, indistinguishably blending with its image reflected in the still water,
            produced a curious resemblance, both in form and colour, to a richly-coated caterpillar,
            as it might appear through a magnifying glass of extraordinary power. The mists gathered
            as we went along: but, when we reached the top of Kirkstone, we were glad we had not
            been discouraged by the apprehension of bad weather. Though not able to see a hundred
            yards before us, we were more than contented. At such a time, and in such a place, every
            scattered stone the size of one's head becomes a companion. Near the top of the Pass is
            the remnant of an old wall, which (magnified, though obscured, by the vapour) might have
            been taken for a fragment of some monument of ancient grandeur,—yet that same pile
            of stones we had never before even observed. This situation, it must be allowed, is not
            favourable to gaiety; but a pleasing hurry of spirits accompanies the surprise
            occasioned by objects transformed, dilated, or distorted, as they are when seen through
            such a medium. Many of the fragments of rock on <pb rend="none"/> the top and slopes of Kirkstone,
            and of similar places, are fantastic enough in themselves; but the full effect of such
            impressions can only be had in a state of weather when they are not likely to be <emph>sought</emph> for. It was not till we had descended considerably that the
            fields of Hartshope were seen, like a lake tinged by the reflection of sunny clouds: I
            mistook them for Brothers-water, but, soon after, we saw that Lake gleaming faintly with
            a steelly brightness,—then, as we continued to descend, appeared the brown oaks,
            and the birches of lively yellow—and the cottages—and the lowly <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n167.html">Hall of Hartshope</ref>, with its long roof and ancient chimneys.
            During great part of our way to Patterdale, we had rain, or rather drizzling vapour; for
            there was never a drop upon our hair or clothes larger than the smallest pearls upon a
            lady's ring.</p>
                  <p>The following morning, incessant rain till <time>11 o'clock</time>, when the sky began
            to clear, and we walked along the eastern shore of Ullswater towards the farm of
            Blowick. The wind blew strong, and drove the clouds forward, on the side of the mountain
            above our heads;—two storm-stiffened black yew-trees fixed our notice, seen
            through, or under the edge of, the flying mists,—four or five goats were bounding
            among the rocks;—the sheep moved about more quietly, or cowered beneath their
            sheltering places. This is the only part of the country where goats are now found;<note resp="author" place="foot">
                        <date>A.D. 1805</date>. These also have disappeared.</note>
            but this <pb rend="none"/> morning, before we had seen these, I was reminded of that picturesque
            animal by two rams of mountain breed, both with <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n168.html">Ammonian
            horns</ref>, and with <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n169.html">beards majestic as that which Michael Angelo
              has given to his statue of Moses</ref>.—But to return; when our path had brought
            us to that part of the naked common which overlooks the woods and bush-besprinkled
            fields of Blowick, the lake, clouds, and mists were all in motion to the sound of
            sweeping winds; —the church and cottages of Patterdale scarcely visible, or seen
            only by fits between the shifting vapours. To the northward the scene was less
            visionary;—Place Fell steady and bold;—the whole lake driving onward like a
            great river—waves dancing round the small islands. The house at Blowick was the
            boundary of our walk; and we returned, lamenting to see a decaying and uncomfortable
            dwelling in a place where sublimity and beauty seemed to contend with each other. But
            these regrets were dispelled by a glance on the woods that clothe the opposite steeps of
            the lake. How exquisite was the mixture of sober and splendid hues! The general
            colouring of the trees was brown—rather that of ripe hazel nuts; but towards the
            water, there were yet beds of green, and in the highest parts of the wood, was abundance
            of yellow foliage, which, gleaming through a vapoury lustre, reminded us of masses of
            clouds, as you see them gathered together in the west, and touched with the golden light
            of the setting sun. <pb rend="none"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>After dinner we walked up the Vale: I had never had an idea of its extent and width in
            passing along the public road on the other side. We followed the path that leads from
            house to house; two or three times it took us through some of those copses or groves
            that cover the little hillocks in the middle of the vale, making an intricate and
            pleasing intermixture of lawn and wood. Our fancies could not resist the temptation; and
              <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n170.html">we fixed upon a spot for a cottage</ref>, which we began to build:
            and finished as easily as castles are raised in the air.—Visited the same spot in
            the evening. I shall say nothing of the moonlight aspect of the situation which had
            charmed us so much in the afternoon; but I wish you had been with us when, in returning
            to <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n171.html">our friend's house</ref>, we espied his lady's large white dog,
            lying in the moonshine upon the round knoll under the old yew-tree in the garden, a
            romantic image—the dark tree and its dark shadow—and the elegant creature,
            as fair as a spirit! The torrents murmured softly: the mountains down which they were
            falling did not, to my sight furnish a back-ground for this Ossianic picture; but I had
            a consciousness of the depth of the seclusion, and that mountains were embracing us on
            all sides; "<ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n172.html">I saw not, but I <emph>felt</emph> that they
              were there</ref>." </p>
                  <p>
                     <date>Friday, November 9th</date>.——Rain, as yesterday, till <time>10
              o'clock</time>, when we took a boat to row down the lake. The day
            improved,—clouds and sunny gleams on the mountains. In the <pb rend="none"/> large bay under
            Place Fell, three fishermen were dragging a net,—a picturesque group beneath the
            high and bare crags! A raven was seen aloft; not hovering like the kite, for that is not
            the habit of the bird; but passing on with a straight-forward perseverance, and timing
            the motion of its wings to its own croaking. The waters were agitated; and the iron tone
            of the raven's voice, which strikes upon the ear at all times as the more dolorous from
            its regularity, was in fine keeping with the wild scene before our eyes. This
            carnivorous fowl is a great enemy to the lambs of these solitudes; I recollect
            frequently seeing, when a boy, bunches of unfledged ravens suspended from the churchyard
            gates of <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n173.html">H ----------</ref>, for which <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n174.html">a reward
              of <emph> so</emph> much a head was given to the adventurous
              destroyer</ref>.— The fishermen drew their net ashore, and hundreds of fish were
            leaping in their prison. They were all of the kind called skellies, a sort of
            fresh-water herring, shoals of which may sometimes be seen dimpling or rippling the
            surface of the lake in calm weather. This species is not found, I believe, in any other
            of these lakes; nor, as far as I know, is <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n175.html">the chevin</ref>, that <emph>spiritless</emph> fish, (though I am loth to call it so, for it was <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n176.html">a prime favourite with Isaac Walton</ref>,) which must frequent
            Ullswater, as I have seen a large shoal passing into the lake from the river Eamont. <emph>Here</emph> are no pike, and the char are smaller than those of the other
            lakes, and of inferior quality; but the grey trout attains a very large size, sometimes
            weighing above twenty pounds. <pb rend="none"/> This lordly creature seems to know that "<ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n177.html">retiredness is a piece of majesty</ref>"; for it is scarcely ever
            caught, or even seen, except when it quits the depths of the lake in the spawning
            season, and runs up into the streams, where it is too often destroyed in disregard of
            the law of the land and of nature. </p>
                  <p>Quitted the boat in the bay of Sandwyke, and pursued our way towards Martindale along a
            pleasant path—at first through a coppice, bordering the lake, then through green
            fields —and came to the village, (if village it may be called, for the houses are
            few, and separated from each other,) a sequestered spot, shut out from the view of the
            lake. Crossed <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n178.html">the one-arched bridge</ref>, below <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n179.html">the chapel, with its "bare ring of mossy wall,"</ref> and single yew-tree. At the
            last house in the dale we were greeted by the master, who was sitting at his door, with
            a flock of sheep collected round him, for the purpose of smearing them with tar
            (according to the custom of the season) for protection against the winter's cold. He
            invited us to enter, and view a room built by <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n180.html">Mr. Hasell</ref> for
            the accommodation of his friends at the annual chase of red deer in his forests at the
            head of these dales. The room is fitted up in the sportsman's style, with a cupboard for
            bottles and glasses, with strong chairs, and a dining-table; and ornamented with the
            horns of the stags caught at these hunts for a succession of years—the length of
            the last race each had run being recorded under his spread<!-- - --><pb rend="none"/>ing antlers. The good
            woman treated us with oaten cake, new and crisp; and after this welcome refreshment and
            rest, we proceeded on our return to Patterdale by a short cut over the mountains. On
            leaving the fields of Sandwyke, while ascending by a gentle slope along the valley of
            Martindale, we had occasion to observe that in thinly-peopled glens of this character
            the general want of wood gives a peculiar interest to the scattered cottages embowered
            in sycamore. Towards its head, this valley splits into two parts; and in one of these
            (that to the left) there is no house, nor any building to be seen but a cattle-shed on
            the side of a hill, which is sprinkled over with trees, evidently the remains of an
            extensive forest. Near the entrance of the other division stands the house where we were
            entertained, and beyond the enclosures of that farm there are no other. A few old trees
            remain, relics of the forest, a little stream hastens, though with serpentine windings,
            through the uncultivated hollow, where many cattle were pasturing. The cattle of this
            country are generally white, or light-coloured; but these were dark brown, or black,
            which heightened the resemblance this scene bears to many parts of the Highlands of
            Scotland.—While we paused to rest upon the hill-side, though well contented with
            the quiet every-day sounds— the lowing of cattle, bleating of sheep, and the very
            gentle murmuring of the valley stream, we could not but think what a grand effect <pb rend="none"/>
            the music of the bugle-horn would have among these mountains. It is still heard once
            every year, at the chase I have spoken of; a day of festivity for the inhabitants of
            this district except the poor deer, the most ancient of them all. Our ascent even to the
            top was very easy; when it was accomplished we had exceedingly fine views, some of the
            lofty Fells being resplendent with sunshine, and others partly shrouded by clouds.
            Ullswater, bordered by black steeps, was of dazzling brightness; the plain beyond
            Penrith smooth and bright, or rather gleamy, as the sea or sea sands. Looked down into
            Boardale, which, like Stybarrow, has been named from the wild swine that formerly
            abounded here; but it has now no sylvan covert, being smooth and bare, a long, narrow,
            deep, cradle-shaped glen, lying so sheltered that one would be pleased to see it planted
            by human hands, there being a sufficiency of soil; and the trees would be sheltered
            almost like shrubs in a green-house.— After having walked some way along the top
            of the hill, came in view of Glenriddin and the mountains at the head of
            Grisdale.—Before we began to descend, turned aside to <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n181.html">a small
              ruin, called at this day the chapel</ref>, where it is said the inhabitants of
            Martindale and Patterdale were accustomed to assemble for worship. There are now no
            traces from which you could infer for what use the building had been erected; the loose
            stones and the few which yet continue piled up resemble those which lie <pb rend="none"/> elsewhere
            on the mountain; but the shape of the building having been oblong, its remains differ
            from those of a common sheep-fold; and it has stood east and west. Scarcely did the
            Druids, when they fled to these fastnesses perform their rites in any situation more
            exposed to disturbance from the elements. One cannot pass by without being reminded that
            the rustic psalmody must have had the accompaniment of many a wildly-whistling blast;
            and what dismal storms must have often drowned the voice of the preacher! As we descend,
            Patterdale opens upon the eye in grand simplicity, screened by mountains, and proceeding
            from two heads, Deepdale and Hartshope, where lies the little lake of Brotherswater,
            named in old maps Broaderwater, and probably rightly so; for Bassenthwaite-mere at this
            day, is familiarly called Broadwater; but the change in the appellation of this small
            lake or pool (if it be a corruption) may have been assisted by some melancholy accident
            similar to <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n182.html">what happened about twenty years ago</ref>, when two
            brothers were drowned there, having gone out to take their holiday pleasure upon the ice
            on a new-year's day. </p>
                  <p>A rough and precipitous peat track brought us down to our friend's house.—Another
            fine moonlight night; but a thick fog rising from the neighbouring river, enveloped the
            rocky and wood-crested knoll on which our fancy-cottage had been erected; and, under the
            damp cast upon my feelings, I consoled myself with <pb rend="none"/> moralising on the folly of
            hasty decisions in matters of importance, and the necessity of having at least one
            year's knowledge of a place before you realise airy suggestions in solid stone. </p>
                  <p>
                     <date>Saturday, November 10th.</date> At the breakfast-table tidings reached us of the
            death of Lord Nelson, and of <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n183.html">the victory at Trafalgar</ref>.
            Sequestered as we were from the sympathy of a crowd, we were shocked to hear that the
            bells had been ringing joyously at Penrith to celebrate the triumph. In <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n184.html">the rebellion of the year 1745</ref>, people fled with their valuables
            from the open country to Patterdale, as a place of refuge secure from the incursions of
            strangers. At that time, news such as we had heard might have been long in penetrating
            so far into the recesses of the mountains; but now, as you know, the approach is easy,
            and the communication, in summer time, almost hourly: nor is this strange, for
            travellers after pleasure are become not less active, and more numerous than those who
            formerly left their homes for purposes of gain. The priest on the banks of the remotest
            stream of Lapland will talk familiarly of Buonaparte's last conquests, and discuss the
            progress of the French revolution, having acquired much of his information from
            adventurers impelled by curiosity alone. </p>
                  <p>The morning was clear and cheerful after a night of sharp frost. At 10 o’clock we took
            our way on foot towards Pooley Bridge, on the same side of the lake we had coasted in a
            boat <pb rend="none"/> the day before.—Looked backwards to the south from our favourite
            station above Blowick. The dazzling sunbeams striking upon the church and village, while
            the earth was steaming with exhalations not traceable in other quarters, rendered their
            forms even more indistinct than the partial and flitting veil of unillumined vapour had
            done two days before. The grass on which we trod, and the trees in every thicket were
            dripping with melted hoarfrost. We observed the lemon-coloured leaves of the birches, as
            the breeze turned them to the sun, sparkle, or rather <emph>flash</emph>,
            like diamonds, and the leafless purple twigs were tipped with globes of shining crystal. </p>
                  <p>The day continued delightful, and unclouded to the end. I will not describe the country
            which we slowly travelled through, nor relate our adventures: and will only add, that on
            the afternoon of the 13th we returned along the banks of Ullswater by the usual road.
            The lake lay in deep repose after the agitations of a wet and stormy morning. The trees
            in Gowbarrow park were in that state when what is gained by the disclosure of their bark
            and branches compensates, almost, for the loss of foliage, exhibiting the variety which
            characterises the point of time between autumn and winter. The hawthorns were leafless;
            their round heads covered with rich green berries, and adorned with arches of green
            brambles, and eglantines hung with glossy hips; and the grey trunks of some of the
            ancient oaks, which <pb rend="none"/> in the summer season might have been regarded only for their
            venerable majesty, now attracted notice by a pretty embellishment of green mosses and
            fern intermixed with russet leaves retained by those slender outstarting twigs which the
            veteran tree would not have tolerated in his strength. The smooth silver branches of the
            ashes were bare; most of the alders as green as the Devonshire cottage-myrtle that
            weathers the snows of Christmas.—Will you accept it as some apology for my having
            dwelt so long on the woodland ornaments of these scenes—that <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n185.html">artists speak of the trees on the banks of Ullswater</ref>, and especially along the
            bays of Stybarrow crags, as having a peculiar character of picturesque intricacy in
            their stems and branches, which their rocky stations and the mountain winds have
            combined to give them. </p>
                  <p>At the end of Gowbarrow park a large herd of deer were either moving slowly or standing
            still among the fern. I was sorry when a chance-companion, who had joined us by the way,
            startled them with a whistle, disturbing an image of grave simplicity and thoughtful
            enjoyment; for I could have fancied that those natives of this wild and beautiful region
            were partaking with us a sensation of the solemnity of the closing day. The sun had been
            set some time; and we could perceive that the light was fading away from the coves of
            Helvellyn, but the lake under a luminous sky, was more brilliant than before. </p>
                  <p>After tea at Patterdale, set out again:— <pb rend="none"/> a fine evening; <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="n186.html">the seven stars</ref> close to the mountain-top; all the stars seemed
            brighter than usual. The steeps were reflected in Brotherswater, and, above the lake,
            appeared like enormous black perpendicular walls. The Kirkstone torrents had been swoln
            by the rains, and now filled the mountain pass with their roaring, which added greatly
            to the solemnity of our walk. Behind us, when we had climbed to a great height, we saw
            one light, very distinct, in the vale, like a large red star—a solitary one in the
            gloomy region. The cheerfulness of the scene was in the sky above us. </p>
                  <p>Reached home a little before midnight. The following verses (from the Author's
            Miscellaneous Poems,) after what has just been read may be acceptable to the reader, by
            way of conclusion to this little Volume. </p>
