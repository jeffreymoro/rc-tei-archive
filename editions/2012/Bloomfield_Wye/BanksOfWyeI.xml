    <head>Preface</head>

    <p>IN the summer of 1807, a party of my good friends in Gloucestershire proposed to themselves a
     short excursion down the Wye, and through part of South Wales. </p>

    <p>While this plan was in agitation, the lines which I had composed on 'Shooter's Hill,' during
     ill health, and inserted in my last volume, obtained their particular attention.<note n="2"
      place="foot" resp="editors">See the note Bloomfield appended to the beginning of his
      manuscript <ref target="MSJournal.html">'Journal of a Ten Days' Tour'</ref>: 'In my 'Shooters Hill'
      I have said, / "Of Cambrian Mountains still I dream" / &amp;c. &amp;c. but, / "Tis not for me
      to trace around / The wonders of my native land" / I find that it was through reading that
      poem that the tour was resolv'd on, at least that I became one of the party. My friends
      guess'd that I should like it, and they never form'd a better guess in their lives'
      [Bloomfield's note]. 'Shooter's Hill' appeared in <emph>Wild Flowers</emph>. Lines 73-80 read:
      'Of Cambrian mountains still I dream, /And mouldering vestiges of war; / By time-worn cliff or
      classic stream / Would rove,—but prudence holds a bar. / Come then, O Health, I'll strive to
      bound / My wishes to this airy stand; / 'Tis not for me to trace around / The wonders of my
      native land.</note> A spirit of prediction, as well as sorrow, is there indulged; and it was
     now in the power of this happy party to falsify such predictions, and to render a pleasure to
     the writer of no uncommon<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">uncommon] common 1813</note>
     kind. An invitation to accompany them was the consequence; and the following Journal is the
     result of that invitation.</p>

    <p>Should the reader, from being a resident, or frequent visitor, be well acquainted with the
     route, and able to discover inaccuracies in distances, succession of objects, or local
     particulars, he is requested to recollect, that the party was but ten days; a period much too
     short for correct and laborious description, but quite sufficient for all the powers of poetry
     which I feel capable of exerting. The whole exhibits the language and feelings of man who had
     never before seen a mountainous country; and of this is it is highly necessary that the reader
     should be apprized.</p>

    <p>A Swiss, or perhaps a Scottish Highlander, may smile at supposed or real exaggerations; but
     they will be excellent critics, when they call to mind that they themselves judge, in these
     cases, as I do, by comparison.</p>

    <p>Perhaps it may be said, that because much of public approbation has fallen to my lot, it was
     unwise to venture again. I confess that the journey left such powerful, such unconquerable
     impressions on my mind, that embodying my thoughts in rhyme became a matter almost of
     necessity. To the parties concerned I know it will be an acceptable little volume: to whom, and
     to the public, it is submitted with due respect.</p>

       <emph>Advertisement to the Second Edition</emph>
      <p rend="noCount">When this Poem, or Journal, was submitted to the Public, I endeavoured to meet that
       confined and temporary approbation, which its locality induced me to expect. It is,
       therefore, with no small pleasure that I have, thus, in a Second Edition, the power of
       correcting, and I hope amending, this favourite of my fancy, this gem of my memory, which
       flashes upon me still like the sunshine of Spring. I have seen no regular critique on the
       piece, strange as it may appear, (for I have left London,) and consequently, in the present
       instance, have not the advantage of public criticism.</p>
      <p rend="noCount">The <ref target="people.html#LloydBakerMary">Lady</ref> whose name
       appears in the Dedication is no more; she was a wife and a mother, in their truest sense.
       And, it is sufficient for me to say, that she possessed the character which distinguishes her
       uncle, the venerable <ref target="people.html#SharpGranville">GRANVILLE SHARP</ref>.</p>
      <p rend="noCount">In my own family, I have sustained the loss of my <ref
        target="people.html#BloomfieldMary">second daughter</ref>, in her twentieth year; yet, while
       Providence grants me peace of mind, I enjoy repose, and am, the Reader's Obedient, R.B. <ref

        (with a never to be forgotten piety) joined his family in joyful thanks to his Maker, for
        the restoration of his mother's health. His parents, in justice to his amiable virtue and
        excellent disposition, declare, that he was void of offence towards them. With humbled
        hearts they bow to the Almighty's dispensation; trusting, through the mediation of his
        blessed Son, he will mercifully receive their child he so suddenly took to himself.</p>

        knowledge. The lamented youth swam very well; was endowed with great bodily strength and
        activity; and possibly, had proper application been used, might have been saved from his
        untimely fate. He was born at Oporto, in the kingdom of Portugal, on the 14th of February,

       naval conflicts of latter days! [Bloomfield's note, referring to Caesar's <emph>Commentaries
        on the Gallic Wars</emph>]. Bloomfield's imagination was caught by what he read about South
       Sea island customs and society. In a note to <emph>The Farmer's Boy; a Rural Poem</emph>
       (London, 1800), p. 102, he quotes a passage from 'Reflections of Otaheite: Cook's second
       Voyage' thus: 'The King, at times, amuses himself with the occupations of his subjects; and
       not yet depraved by false notions of empty state, he often paddles his own canoe, without
       considering such an employment derogatory to his dignity'. He probably read the passage in
