            <p class="noCount">ART. III. The Banks of the Wye; a Poem. In four Books. By Robert Bloomfield, Author
               of the Farmer's Boy. 12mo. 134pp. 5s. Vernor and Co. &amp;c 1811 </p>
            <p>THE poet of native inspiration, neither needing nor disdaining cultivation, may not
               unaptly be compared, himself, to the banks of the Wye, which abounding in natural
               beauties, are yet neither savage nor untractable. Of the Wye, however, we speak, as
               the bard did till lately, by fame alone, and not without a feeling that approaches
               to envy, respecting the delightful excursion of ten days, which his Muse has here
               immortalized. </p>
            <p class="indent1">In his beautiful poem called 'Shooter's Hill,' (published in his 'Wild Flowers,')
               Bloomfield had spoken thus of the scenes of Wales. </p>

            <p class="indent1">Some kind friends of the poet determined to offer him that pleasure, of which he there
               seemed to despair, and invited him to accompany them in a short excursion to South
               Wales. 'It was now,' says he, 'in the power of this happy party, to falsify such predictions,
               and to render a pleasure to the writer of no common kind.' The invitation was gladly
               accepted, and the plan realized in August, 1807. The present poem commemorates the
               thoughts and feelings of the author on this occasion; and though he does not undertake
               to give an elaborate account of the scenes which struck his delighted imagination,
               yet he offers what is much better, a lively image of a poet's mind, under circumstances
               of natural and innocent gratification. The following introduction tells, in a spirited
               and pleasing manner, the origin of the excursion. </p>

            <p class="indent1">This poem will probably, in future, be the companion of those who visit the Wye, for
               the sake of pleasurable excursion; who will delight to trace the varying scenes as
               here described, and particularly to discover the 'bluff rock,' which was named by
               the party after the poet. We will not say that, in every instance, he satisfies our
               ear with his measure, or our imagination with his pictures, but he has thrown an interest
               over the whole which will always enable the lover of poetry to attend him with pleasure.
               The opening of the fourth and last book is particularly pleasing. </p>

            <p class="indent1">Readers! you have now before you an ample specimen of Bloomfield's 'Banks of the Wye.'
               You will not probably rank this poem with the happiest of his efforts, nor will you
               think it unworthy of him. It might have been more perfect, but still it has many charms.
