               <p>Robert Bloomfield’s poem, tour journal and sketch book <em>The Banks of Wye</em> (1807-11) represents a visually and verbally rich response to the fashionable tour
                  of the Wye that the poets <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GrayThomas">Thomas Gray</a> and William Wordsworth, the artists <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SandbyPaul">Paul Sandby</a> and J. M. W. Turner, and the picturesque theorists <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GilpinWilliam">William Gilpin</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PriceUvedale">Uvedale Price</a>, made popular. Entering the valley later than these tourists, Bloomfield took an
                  already well-travelled and much-described route. His Wye texts reveal the cultural
                  significance the tour had already acquired but also show the way that tourism redefined
                  existing genres. It put the topographical and Georgic poem in motion: views were now
                  observed from a boat or carriage rather than from hilltops. It encouraged appreciation
                  of native, rather than Italian, scenes and antiquities, identifying the tourist patriotically
                  with British, rather than classical, landscape and history. And it promoted a tradition
                  of amateur enquiry: Bloomfield's manuscript sketch- and scrap-book is an example of
                  the newly popular fashion for on-the-spot sketching. Full of self-penned images of
                  views and ruins, it is a fine example of the visual culture that the English gentry
                  began to produce and to value, a homemade book to pass around in drawing rooms before
                  turning either to the latest set of engravings published by Mr Westall or Mr Turner
                  or to the poetic tour —<em>The Banks of Wye</em> — that Bloomfield himself issued in print. Bloomfield, indeed, hoped to issue not
                  just the poetic tour but also the 'whole triple-page'd Journal, Drawings, prose, and
                  rhime'.

                  of poem, prose, scrap- and sketch-book, can we, the public, see the multimedia response

               <p>If this edition reveals much about the picturesque tour and the visual and manuscript
                  culture of the Romantic era, it also tells us much about Bloomfield himself. Although
                  hardly a household name or canonical author now, he was, when he took his tour of
                  the Wye valley and the Welsh borders in 1807, already established as the best-selling
                  'pastoral poet' of the age—far better known than Wordsworth and Coleridge, whose <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> his own <em>Farmer's Boy</em> (1800) outsold by twenty to one. Indeed, in the eyes of contemporaries, it was Bloomfield,
                  rather than the two West Country and Lakeland poets we now call 'Romantics', who had
                  revived both landscape verse (the dominant poetic genre in the 1700s) and Rural Tales
                  (the title of his second, 1802, collection) for the new century. But he had not done
                  so by harvesting the already-poetic landscape of the Wye valley. For although Bloomfield
                  admired the work of John Dyer, who had imagined the Welsh Marches as Siluria—a culturally
                  unique zone in which, since Roman times, British history had been rooted into the
                  landscape
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>John Dyer, The Fleece: a Poem in Four Books (London, 1757). Dyer's Siluria is discussed
                           in John Goodridge, Rural Life in Eighteenth-Century English Poetry (Cambridge, 1995).</span></div>
                  </div> — it was nevertheless, the flatter area of Suffolk that inspired his poetry. Suffolk
                  because it was there, in a small village, that Bloomfield had spent his boyhood and
                  there, in that same small village, that his family still lived. Bloomfield himself,
                  however, did not: his rural poetry detailed his Suffolk youth from a distance; it
                  was a new kind of Georgic not just because it spoke of rural work from the perspective
                  of a labourer rather than a landowner but also because it spoke from the city. Bloomfield's
                  were poems for the new urbanising Britain because they remembered the country from
                  the position of a villager who had, as so many thousands did in the early nineteenth
                  century, emigrated to London. And they did so from a world of sweated labour: Bloomfield's
                  boyhood was an emotion recollected not in tranquillity but in the workshop; he composed
                  verse in his head whilst labouring for hours a day as a shoemaker in an East End garret.</p>
            </div>
            <p>If Bloomfield's poetry gives the lie to Wordsworth's fear (expressed in the Preface
               to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>) that mechanical labour corrupts, by its very repetitiveness, the taste of the labourer,
               it nevertheless displays many of the same characteristics as Wordsworth's own verse—a
               matter not of mutual influence but of similar responses to times in which an industrialising
               culture left many people deracinated and yearning for a half-remembered place of origin—a
               childhood land in which the power of capital had not yet disturbed the culture or
               the consciousness. These similar responses included the organisation of verse according
               to the work-rhythms of shepherds and labourers, the penning of rural tales based on
               popular ballads and songs, and the addressing of poems to favourite landscapes. Not
               surprisingly, Bloomfield was an early supporter of Wordsworth's poetry: he had read
               'Tintern Abbey' by 1802; he was, by 1807 a poet steeped in the latest developments
               in the loco-descriptive poetry that James Thomson and William Cowper had perfected
               a few generations earlier.</p>
            <p>Bloomfield took to the hills. When he climbed Box Hill, Surrey, in 1803, during a
               solitary walking tour, it was the first time he had been in upland country, having
               previously, like most of the labouring classes, been confined to the fields and the
               shop where he worked: <span class="quote">‘Having been harrassd by too much thinking and too many trivial engagements, and an
                  employment that I shall never like, I determined that I would respire one mouthfull
                  of real country air if possible and I know at the same time that pollution of smoke
                  reaches ten miles round the Metropolis. I had heard much of Leithe Hills and of Box
                  Hill in the neighbourhood of Dorking. . . . Remember that I am no Welshman, therefore
                  to me these Hills are Cader Idris's and Snowdens.— (<a class="link_ref" href="../../bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.106.html">letter 106</a> of <em>The Letters of Robert Bloomfield</em>: to George Bloomfield, 17 April 1803)’</span> The tour put Bloomfield in the position of a Romantic for the first time: a solitary
               walker travelling as a social, aesthetic and moral antidote to the effects of modern,
               urban life upon him. It led to no published writing, only to private correspondence,
               but it made him all the more eager to go west in 1807 when a tour of Wales was suggested
               by his friend <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerMary">Mary Lloyd Baker</a> of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Uley">Uley</a> in Gloucestershire.</p>
            <p><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerMary">Lloyd Baker</a>, née Sharp, had written a fan-letter to Bloomfield in 1803. This led to a correspondence
               and to Bloomfield's warm reception in Lloyd Baker's extended family-circle of sisters,
               aunts and uncles, based near London and in Northamptonshire. The Sharps were radical
               Whig gentry (<a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpGranville">Granville Sharp</a>, the anti-slavery and anti-cruelty campaigner, was Lloyd Baker's uncle) who neither
               wished to interfere in his publications nor make him recite verses in public. They
               had no designs upon him, though he remained conscious of their difference in class,
               power and education and knew that he could never reciprocate their invitations to
               their houses. But Bloomfield enjoyed their attention and readily made his way in August
               1807 to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Uley">Uley</a>, to take the tour in the company of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerMary">Lloyd Baker</a>, her husband the local landowner, and their friends <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CooperRobert">Robert Bransby Cooper</a> and his son and daughter (relatives of the radical surgeon Astley Cooper). Together,
               the party then embarked on an elongated version of the already-popular tourist route:
               they went by road from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Uley">Uley</a> to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#RossOnWye">Ross</a>, then by boat along the Wye, alighting at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#TinternAbbey">Tintern</a>.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This route was already established, featuring in the prose of picturesque tours, and
                  in numerous watercolours and engravings. Of the former, Bloomfield became familiar
                  with work of the poet <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GrayThomas">Thomas Gray</a>, who toured the Wye and Wales in summer 1770, and whose enthusiastic notes about
                  the scenery and antiquities were published after his death as <em>A Catalogue of the Antiquities, Houses, Parks, Plantations, Scenes, and Situations,
                     in England and Wales</em> (1773). He also refers to the aesthetic discussions of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GilpinWilliam">William Gilpin</a> as revealed in the seminal work of the picturesque, <em>Observations on the River Wye and several parts of South Wales, etc. relative chiefly
                     to Picturesque Beauty; made in the summer of the year 1770</em> (1782). Gilpin's book was illustrated with plates based on Gilpin's sketches, etched
                  by his nephew William Sawrey Gilpin using the aquatint process. Sketching as they
                  went, Bloomfield and his companions continued a fashion for sketching tours that Gilpin
                  had helped popularise. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BanksJoseph">Sir Joseph Banks</a> had come down the river in 1771, bringing the artist <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SandbyPaul">Paul Sandby</a> with him, and aquatints after Sandby's pictures circulated widely. In 1794 Sir George
                  Beaumont, a keen amateur artist, later to be Wordsworth's friend and patron, went
                  to Tintern with the painter Thomas Hearne. Hearne's pictures were engraved and published
                  in his <em>Antiquities of Great-Britain, Illustrated in Views of Monasteries, Castles, and Churches...</em> (1786-1807). Other artists followed, recognising a growing market for topographical
                  and historical views: by the time Bloomfield embarked, sites on the Wye such as <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#GoodrichCastle">Goodrich Castle</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#TinternAbbey">Tintern Abbey</a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Chepstow">Chepstow Castle</a> had been drawn, engraved and published many times over.

                  </div> To service the growing numbers of tourists, a local trade grew up: the Monmouth printer <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HeathCharles">Charles Heath</a> began to specialise in guidebooks. In rapid succession he published <em>A Descriptive Account of Raglan Castle</em> (1792), a <em>Descriptive Account of Tintern Abbey</em> (1793), an <em>Account of the Scenery of the Wye</em> (1795), <em>The Excursion down the Wye</em> (1796), and <em>Accounts of … Monmouth</em> (1804). Bloomfield used the <em>Excursion down the Wye</em> in preparing his own Wye texts and also relied upon the recently-published work of
                  the antiquarian and traveller <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CoxeWilliam">William Coxe</a>, <em>A Historical Tour in Monmouthshire</em> (1801).</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>It was not only in print that the Wye tourist received assistance. An infrastructure
                  grew up to service travellers' needs, as Suzanne Matheson describes: <span class="quote">‘A water journey to Tintern Abbey was less taxing for passengers than land-travel,
                     although not free entirely from danger or discomfort. Recreational excursions on the
                     Wye were taking place by the 1740s, instituted by the hospitable Rev. Dr. John Egerton
                     of Ross (later Bishop of Durham), the so-called 'father of the Wye voyage'. In 1745
                     Egerton 'caused a pleasure boat to be built to enable his guests to enjoy excursions
                     by water amid scenery which could not fail to delight and surprise.'

                  Wye itinerary a further land trip out of the Wye valley into mountainous Wales: <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Abergavenny">Abergavenny</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Crickhowell">Crickhowell</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Brecon">Brecon</a>, before returning to the Wye at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#HayOnWye">Hay</a> and proceeding to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Hereford">Hereford</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Malvern">Malvern</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Cheltenham">Cheltenham</a> and home.</p>

            <p>But it was the boat trip along the river that initially fascinated Bloomfield and
               that led him into the spots celebrated by picturesque writers, not least Tintern Abbey.
               Bloomfield's response to the famous ruin was a little different from Gilpin's and
               Wordsworth's: he neither wished for a mallet to break some of the gables to make the
               abbey more picturesque nor averted his gaze from the beggars and ironworks that clustered
               around. Instead, moved too deeply to sit and sketch the arches as his companions did,
               he 'gave vent to my feelings by singing for their amusement and my own the <a class="link_ref" href="MSJournal.html#104Psalm">104th Psalm</a>'. The 104th Psalm thanks the Lord for creating the earth. In the King James' version
               Bloomfield knew, it evokes pastoral valleys such as that in which Tintern stands:
               </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">

               </div> (Psalm 104:10-14)</blockquote>
            <p> Bloomfield declared of his performance 'though no "fretted vault" remains to harmonize
               the sound, it soothed me into that state of mind which is most to be desired'. 'Fretted
               vault' is a quotation from Gray's 'Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard': 'Where
               thro' the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault / The pealing anthem swells the note
               of praise' (lines 39-40). For Bloomfield, then, the pastoral valley and ruined church
               call forth a poetic act of worship, poetry being the mode which he feels to be profound
               enough to express his love of nature and its creator. This act, he knows, is over-determined:
               he sees the abbey and imagines his Psalm-singing in relation to Gray's portrait of
               the country church as a place where the act of commemoration acquires value. He is
               self-consciously following in Gray's verse-steps, quietly claiming poetry as a deeper,
               more pious, response to Tintern than the picturesque sketches that tourists were expected
               to make.</p>
            <p>Visiting the Wye as a labourer-poet taken-up by well-meaning patrons, and as a tourist
               expected to sing for his tour, Bloomfield found himself in a new and precarious position.
               Mostly, he enjoyed it, since, precisely because he had been tied to his trade in a
               way gentlemen poets never were (even poor and radical ones like Wordsworth and Coleridge),
               he had never before travelled west of London. Nonetheless, his new and, to him, anomalous
               position, a visitor rather than rather a Londoner recollecting his native Suffolk,
               led him to commence an innovative kind of work—a conventional tour poem (<em>The Banks of Wye</em> (1811)) that was to accompany a prose guide with accompanying sketches made at picturesque
               spots. As such, the project, like Wordsworth's <em>Description of the Scenery of the Lakes</em> (1811) was a new, hybrid, genre, the tour guidebook as rewritten by the poet to feature
               his own verse and illustrations. The effect was to represent the region as a place
               of aesthetic value and antiquarian interest: footnotes gave historical information
               about ruined castles and Roman forts. Bloomfield hoped to take advantage of his popularity
               as a topographical poet and of the Wye's renown as a picturesque location, building
               on the success of <em>The Farmer's Boy</em>, which featured many engravings of rural scenes, by feeding the public's ever-increasing
               desire for lavishly illustrated books.</p>
            <p>Bloomfield began the making of his Wye-book while still basking in the warmth of the
               new experience and the attention paid him by the gentlewomen of the party. His letters
               show him taking his new roles as artist and tour guide very seriously, seeking sketches
               and verse from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerMary">Mary Lloyd Baker</a> and promising her a private view of his work: <span class="quote">‘But of all this I will write more in due time. And you will here probably ask yourself,

J. Lloyd Baker</a>, 18 November 1807)</blockquote>
            <p> Mildly flirtatious letters of this kind were Bloomfield's way of prolonging a relationship
               that was valuable to him: <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerMary">Lloyd Baker's</a> admiration, and that of her sisters and aunt, gave him confidence without intimidating
               him (as the patronage of noblemen tended to do). He flourished in a feminine circle,
               enjoying being humorous for their benefit, unbuttoning as he could not to others outside
               his class, but knowing, all the same, that his value to these gentlewomen depended
               upon his amusing them. He was, nonetheless, careful to show the ladies' powerful husbands
               that he needed their help too, consulting <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerThomasJ">Thomas Lloyd Baker</a> and his friend <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CooperRobert">Robert Bransby Cooper</a> about histories of Monmouthshire in preparation of the prose section of the book.
               As a result, he made frequent use of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CoxeWilliam">Coxe's</a> <em>An Historical Tour in Monmouthshire</em>, adding to both prose journal and verse tour historical notes that affiliated his
               work to the antiquarian texts consulted by learned gentlemen.</p>
            <p>Despite Bloomfield's diligent effort, his Wye-book never appeared in the intended
               tripartite prose/poetry/picture format. Back in London, away from the Lloyd Baker/Sharp
               circle, afflicted by financial difficulties and sinking into depression, he found
               work slowing-up. It was not until February 1811, after many months' practice at turning
               his rough sketches into finished drawings and much research into local history, that
               he sent the Wye-book to his publishers, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#VernorThomas">Vernor</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas">Hood</a>, only to hear that that they were now 'averse to the costly and fashionable stile
               of publishing' and would produce only a smaller-scale volume with no more than four
               illustrations (<a class="link_ref" href="../../bloomfield_letters/HTML/letterEEd.25.256.html">letter 256</a> of <em>The Letters of Robert Bloomfield</em>: to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerMary">Mary Lloyd Baker</a>, 16 January-2 February 1811). Their decision may have been an early indication of
               the financial difficulties that would bankrupt the firm after <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas">Hood's</a> death in 1811. At all events, it made the book they did publish in that year a far
               less appealing production, containing only Bloomfield's Georgic verse and a few engravings
               after his fellow-tourist <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CooperRobert">Bransby Cooper's</a> sketches. Nevertheless, <em>The Banks of Wye</em>, now more straightforwardly a poetry publication, was a substantial work, albeit
               not one for which the public was looking from a poet they liked for his tales of village
               life. Two centuries later, however, we can finally reconstitute the Wye-book that
               Bloomfield originally prepared, by accompanying the 1811 poem with the prose journal
               (transcribed from the manuscript), exhibiting the sketch- and scrap-book, restoring
               deleted passages of the poem from manuscript, and investigating hitherto unpublished
               letters.</p>

               <p>Reconstituted here, Bloomfield's Wye-book can be seen to have made a distinctive response

                  </div> a matter of Bloomfield's sympathetic understanding of the work of the rural labourers
                  that he now witnessed, in passing, as a leisured tourist—an understanding that subverts
                  the unthinking aestheticisation of labour that often characterises the picturesque.
                  The informal prose journal shows Bloomfield chatting long with a shoemaker friend
                  in Ross; discussing the price of cider with their Welsh guide; noting that the Welsh
                  girl who served their meal at Tintern was glad to see them go. Everywhere, he is immediately
                  interested in the people who work the landscape, regarding them as authorities on
                  it as important as the guide books, aesthetic treatises and county histories. His
                  viewpoint comprehends not just the viewing stations built by local landowners such
                  as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MorrisValentine">Valentine Morris</a> but also the cracks of the floorboards in his inn-chamber, through which he peeps
                  at the ostlers and maids breakfasting together below. It also sees the burgeoning
                  and smoky forges, smelters and mills that made the sylvan Wye an important industrial
                  centre. And there is a passage of social and moral criticism of the Prince of Wales,
                  which Bloomfield's literary executor Joseph Weston excised from the version of the
                  journal he published in <em>The Remains of Robert Bloomfield</em> (1824): <span class="quote">‘The prince was at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Cheltenham">Cheltenham</a>, and though the votaries of fashion follow him as gnats do a horse, to sting him,
                     or to be lashd to death, I found all moralists, and all thinkers, through the whole <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxxx</span> &lt;town&gt; speak of him with a shake of the head, and a humbled, and negative kind of
                     exultation—I hope the feeling will last as long as <em>truth</em> and <em>history</em>.’</span> Although Bloomfield was not a political writer, there are acerbic comments about the
                  excess and hypocrisy of the wealthy in his letters and he maintained radical and reformist
                  sympathies. These, however, are not apparent in Weston's timorous and conventional
                  version of the journal, which was posthumously produced and had no authorial sanction
                  (it appeared with spelling and punctuation regularised and with occasional slang and
                  accompanying sketches and maps removed). Accordingly, it is not represented in this
                  edition of Bloomfield's Wye texts.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The journal, as the facsimiles presented here show, was never simply a verbal document.
               Bloomfield carefully interspersed his prose descriptions with a wealth of visual material,
               surrounding it on the page and facing it too, so that writing is but one element of
               a representation of the tour to which pictures and maps were also fundamental. In
               this respect Bloomfield's Wye-book offers a glimpse of the practice, common especially
               among gentlewomen, of compiling sketch- and scrap-books that included verse, drawings
               and letters, reconstituting a place, an experience or a relationship on paper. It
               is not, that is to say, the sketchbook of a professional artist who intended to work
               his on-the-spot sketches into finished oils at a later date. Rather, it is a record
               of the tour produced with an audience in mind – compiled to be shared after the event
               with his fellow tourists, to aid them in recreating the tour, and the companionship
               the tour offered, in memory. Even the sketches are social: Bloomfield includes his
               own designs, in and around his prose, with his copies of original drawings made by
               Robert Bransby Cooper and Mary Lloyd Baker and loaned to him after the party's return.
               They represent his incorporation in a gentleman- (and woman-)ly tradition of amateur
               art: Cooper and Lloyd Baker had received tuition in drawing—mastering perspective,
               composition and shading—and Bloomfield's sketches showed them that he in turn had
               learned from them. </p>
            <p>By including maps in his Wye-book, Bloomfield showed he was keen to anchor the sketches
               and the prose to places on a route. Like the published guidebooks, which began to
               feature maps from the 1790s, he sought to locate the views in a graduated space that,
               by virtue of its cartographic representation, he and others could reaccess virtually
               (moreover, he included in the prose journal specific timings of arrival and departure
               from each place visited: the tour would be relivable in memory because it was calibrated
               spatially and temporally on paper). He pasted in small-scale engraved county maps
               of Gloucestershire and Monmouthshire, but these offered little local detail. And so
               he made his own map, a fold-out sheet he entitled 'Sketch of the River Wye, from Ross
               to Chepstow'. Delineating the river in a strip-map, this marked the principal stopping
               point and views: it was, in effect, a new kind of sketch map aimed at serving the
               tourist rather than at giving an overall survey of an estate or county (it would have
               been of no use to a land surveyor, a landowner or an army). As such it reflected a
               change in mapping conventions produced by a change in the social use (and users) of
               maps: in that other area of tourism, the Lake District, Peter Crosthwaite began in
               1783 to sell linear maps of the main lakes to tourists who wanted to follow the shorelines
               in search of picturesque views. The lake, like Bloomfield's river, was abstracted
               from the country that surrounded it, its banks becoming the object of largescale (three
               inches to the mile) cartographic focus. And the map now had for the first time an
               openly aesthetic, rather than economic, aim — to record beauty spots rather than landholdings
               or political boundaries.</p>
            <p>Bloomfield's map remained in manuscript, part of the tripartite Wye-book that never
               achieved publication. What he did publish. however, the verse Banks of Wye, defines
               more directly and forcefully than ever before the new purpose of touring: not the
               education of taste in rules of aesthetic judgement (as in Gilpin) but the mental restorative
               that holiday-escape into natural beauty offered an urban middle-class otherwise chained
               to the account-book and the office. </p>

            <p> Here the Wye is a consolation of age: taking a longer view than Wordsworth at Tintern,
               Bloomfield sees the river, recreated virtually in memory and talk, as reviving, in
               an otherwise sedentary figure, a younger and livelier self. It confers a blessed experience
               of wildness that is also a token of masculinity: the father, defined by domesticity,
               is cheered in himself and admired by his children because recollecting his experiences
               of 'the wizard stream' conjures into being the 'manly brow' of his 'prime of manhood'.</p>
            <p>Bloomfield is ambivalent about the picturesque. His Wye-book was to feature engravings
               after his and his friends' sketches. His prose journal records them sketching at every
               castle they visited. At Tintern, however, sketching was not a deep enough response
               and, as he concludes his verse tour, he offers only faint praise of Gilpin. Artists
               may learn from the Wye, he declares, but by encountering nature's forms and rhythms
               rather than by applying artificial criteria and apparatus:</p>

            <p>Gilpin is 'transported' when he looks at nature unguided by fancy or predetermined
               ideas. Bloomfield's role model is, instead, the poet Gray, who absorbs delight by
               letting his ardent mind repose on the water, as if in meditation.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>How to recline upon the stream was a question for Bloomfield's own representation
                  of the tour. His poetic endorsement of natural form led to a problem that was not
                  resolved in the published <em>Banks of Wye</em>, a problem to which the tripartite Wye-book would have presented a novel solution.
                  The problem concerns his own medium: whether nature's forms and rhythms are always
                  so neatly harnessable within the polite diction and conventional rhyming couplets
                  of the tour poem. Had the poem been combined with the colloquial first-person prose
                  journal and the amateur sketches as it is here, then its obtrusion of formality upon
                  the reader would have been seen to be only one version of the journey, in dialogue
                  with more informal responses which, without it, might themselves have seemed too slight
                  and private for publication. Standing alone, the published poem seemed too mixed,
                  veering from the colloquial to the stilted, lacking the animation of <em>The Farmer's Boy</em> because Bloomfield did not speak for the Wye landscape as his own—known as a place
                  marked on his body and mind by work in its fields. The original verse-manuscript,
                  deleted passages from which are presented in this edition, shows that Bloomfield recognised
                  this difficulty and found an original way to overcome it, for it begins more in a
                  comic-heroic than a polite manner with a prelude about a giant called Scoop, who had
                  fashioned the hills and dales of the Gloucestershire country in which the Lloyd Bakers
                  lived:

                  and undignified account of the country's origin as a giant's casual whim of imitating
                  the hill country of Wales, these opening lines undercut their own pretensions to the
                  heroic. They also present a compliment to Bloomfield's gentlemanly (and womanly) patrons,
                  in which deference is pre-empted by humour. That humour is derived from local folklore:
                  Scoop was a Gloucestershire descendant of the giant of Shropshire legend, Gwendol
                  Wrekin ap Shenkin ap Mynyddmawr, who intended to flood the town of Shrewsbury by dumping
                  a shovelful of earth into the river Severn. He was discouraged by a local shoemaker
                  who told him 'It's a very long way to Shrewsbury . . . look at all these shoes I've
                  worn out walking back from there!' The giant then dropped the spadeful of earth on
                  the ground next to him, where it became the Wrekin hill.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note12" id="Note12_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> It was probably the comic heroism of a fellow shoemaker, and the humorous opposition
                  of Wales and England, that made the story appeal to Bloomfield: he mentioned the giants
                  sleeping in the Welsh mountains later in the poem. It was typical of him to assert
                  and mock his own role as poet creator, and also typical of him to draw on local lore
                  as well as learned books.</p>
            </div>
            <p>As a beginning to a four-book landscape poem, the lines on Giant Scoop are highly
               unorthodox, a versification of the tongue-in-cheek humour of Bloomfield's correspondence
               with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerMary">Lloyd Baker</a>. They are playful, revealing the poet's enjoyment of his own ability to fictionalise,
               to tell it like it's not—and in this they reflect the West Country's status as a charming
               holiday place, an escape from Bloomfield's London cares and from his branding as a
               Suffolk labourer poet. Yet for all that, they do concern themselves with labour, as
               Bloomfield so often did: funny though they are, they show the giant working up a sweat
               digging. Polished, knowing and displaying a flexible deployment of Samuel Butler's
               Hudibrastic cocktail of octosyllabic couplets, phrasal verbs and casual diction, Bloomfield's
               light verses still suggest, however jokily, that the country depends on backbreaking
               toil—a point quietly made later in the poem when the tourists in their pleasure-boat
               glide effortlessly past bent-backed gleaners in the fields. Bloomfield's West Country
               was not a holiday-land for everyone.</p>
            <p>As different from Wordsworth's 'Tintern Abbey' as they are from Gilpin's <em>Observations</em>, Bloomfield's lines on Scoop reveal a cultivated, accomplished, well-read poet entertaining
               his patrons; they also suggest that he was worldly enough to know that the Cotswolds
               were not, after all, the Alps and that, therefore, describing them in pious and solemn
               terms would only lead to bathos. Nevertheless, getting the tone right was a vexing
               matter for him, and as the tour became a more and more distant memory, and the flirtatious
               feminine circle receded from his grasp, he worried about whether the opening was appropriate
               for a piece intended for public consumption. Revealingly, it was when <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerMary">Mary Lloyd Baker</a> wrote to him during the course of another West Country tour she was making (of Cheddar
               Gorge) that, in the light of her intimate attention, he again became enthusiastic
               about the lines, writing in reply <span class="quote">‘[t]he Cheddar Cliffs have taken up a nook in my heart, and imagination scratches
                  a picture of her own, like an old Hen in a garden.’</span> <span class="quote">‘I had taken a momentary dislike to Old Scoop, but you strengthen my original feeling
                  and I begin to think that He may be a personage not <em>altogether</em> to be ridiculed. I have a great mind to keep him alive.

               (evident in the more sober main body of the poem) about his qualifications to write
               in the style of a leisured gentleman—a position in which the trip put him for the
               first time. He internalised the perceived doubts of his patrons, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel">Capel Lofft</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ParkThomas">Thomas Park</a>, literary gentlemen who edited poetry for magazines, and consulted other friends
               too: it seems none of these men, arbiters of conventional taste, saw the opening as
               serious enough. Effectively, as another letter to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerMary">Mary</a> reveals, Bloomfield's was too playful a discourse to meet male expectations about
               the proper language for topographical poetry: </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">Since you saw or heard any part of my Journal, and I think I remember <em>how far</em> I had then proceeded in my amusement, much alteration has taken place in the plan
               and divisions &amp;c. As I advanced I began to conceive that it might even eventualy be
               renderd fit for publication, and this perswasion set me about a thorough examination
               and revision. I concieved that it was, owing to the careless and hasty manner of its
               early composition, much too hudibrastic, and containd a vast deal of useless matter
               which might give way to the superior graces of nature, or to unbridled fancy. I had
               finished it, as I thought, according to this plan, last summer; and I had the joint
               opinion of my then companions, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#InskipThomas">Inskip</a>, himself a poet, and a man of strong mind, and my host, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph">Mr. Weston</a> of Shefford, Beds, and as he has read and thought more than any man I ever found
               in his station of life, and his age, and is an enthusiast in poetry, with a memory
               truly astonishing considering his multifarious reading, I consider him highly capable
               of detecting what were blemishes in a harum scarum story like mine,—We read it for
               the purpose of criticizing closely, We all doubted the propriety of Giant Scoop in
               the outset of the piece, yet all agreed that the ridiculous thought was not without
               merit, only perhaps out of place. Previous to this I had shown it to Mr <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RogersSamuel">Rogers</a>, author of 'The pleasures of memory', and he, even then, in its ruder state, said
               that it would probably be well recieved if published, but that it was evident that
               I had not taken the pains with it which might be taken. I then wrote the whole out
               again with great emendations, in which state Mr. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel">Lofft</a> gave the opinion which I very barely stated to you. I took his hints and the others
               in conjunction, and wrote <em>the whole out again</em>, still in the mending way with additions and curtailments, and in this new dress,
               without the personage above mentioned, Scoop, I submited the piece to the calm, judicious,
               and candid Mr <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ParkThomas">Park</a> of Hampstead (He had seen the giant long ago and said nothing in his praise, which
               I know how to understand) He was decidedly of opinion that the thing would do me credit,
               and at the same time pencil'd his doubts and remarks. With this encouragement I once
               more wrote out the whole; gave the brat a name; and offer'd it to My Bookseller. I
               know of nothing which can now retard its ultimate appearance before the world.

            <p> Being new to the tour-poem and of inferior class to his readers, Bloomfield did not
               dare to be facetious and mock the public's cultural expectations of such a book and
               of the place it described. Abandoning his hudibrastic lines, he left out the most
               characteristic and individual of his poetic voices, submitting to male critics rather
               than reproduce in public the verse inspired by his chatty, female correspondents.
               What was lost in this new excision from <em>The Banks of Wye</em>, however, was an idiosyncratic response to the West Country that remade the poetic
               traditions in which that region had previously been compassed and that questioned
               the conventional pieties of the gentlemanly tour. Without this response, and lacking
               the prose journal and extensive illustrations intended for the tripartite publication,
               <em>The Banks of Wye</em> was a slighter and less original book than first planned.</p>
            <p>The abandonment of the tripartite Wye-book and the excision of Old Scoop revealed
               that Bloomfield was unable to continue in a direction in which his writing took comic
               flight away from his homeground. He was not helped by those arbiters of politeness
               and propriety, the reviewers: 'the author's humour is generally very poor; and the
               language of it too coarse even for his honesty of style' declared the <em><a class="link_ref" href="Review_Eclectic_Review.html">Eclectic Review</a></em>, while the <em><a class="link_ref" href="Review_Critical_Review.html">Critical Review</a></em> spoke of 'bathos' and 'vulgarity' and singled-out offending phrases. In the second
               edition of the poem of 1813, perhaps in response to the reviewers' sniffiness about
               the colloquialisms, Bloomfield revised in favour of more formal, serious and socially
               conservative diction: thus he omitted a whimsical passage imagining a war between
               earth and gods: </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="indent3">Celestial power with earthly mix'd;</div>
                  <div class="indent3">Gods by the arrow's point transfix'd!</div>
               </div> (III, 247-48)</blockquote>
            <p> He also added initial capitals to 'king' and 'heaven'. Elsewhere he redrafted to
               clarify meaning but, in the process, made the verse more Latinate and Thomsonian,
               as a topographical poem was expected to be (as a youth Bloomfield had been inspired
               to write by reading <em>The Seasons</em>). Thus the lines 'When a dark thunder-storm had spread / Its terrors round the guilty
               head' (II, 71-72 in the 1811 text) became, in 1813, 'A summer flood's resistless pow'r
               / Raised the grim ruin in an hour! / When that o'erwhelming tempest spread / Its terrors
               round the guilty head'. All verbal revisions in the editions published (or prepared
               for publication) in Bloomfield's lifetime are recorded as variants in the present
               edition, the copytext for which is the 1811 first published version.</p>
            <p>The revisions are regrettable because they tend to cloak the innovative, common speech
               element of the poem in gentrified respectability. Bloomfield in fact understood better
               than did the prissy reviewers for polite journals, as Wordsworth and Byron also did,
               that a tour poem – whether the 'Epistle to Sir George Beaumont, Bart' or <em>Don Juan</em> — demanded informality, since it depended on the convention that it was a letter
               home from a traveller. And this was still more the case in view of the fact that Bloomfield
               was a commoner, a shoemaker rather than a lord, who aimed to be a man speaking to
               men (and who, revealingly, admired the Wordsworth's colloquial 'The Idiot Boy'). Unlike
               Wordsworth (himself scorned by reviewers for his adherence to common speech) and still
               more unlike Byron, Bloomfield was dependent on powerful gentlemen who were his social
               superiors. He could not ignore polite disapproval and so he pruned some of his colloquialisms
               away. The published <em>Banks of Wye</em> of 1811 and 1813 suffered by this removal, the remaining comic slang seeming increasingly
               out of place in a poem that mostly conformed to approved poetic diction.</p>
            <p>Despite its often stilted verse, time after time the poem flares into life for the
               space of a highly original passage. Bloomfield's sincerity to his own highly unusual
               viewpoint —a labouring-class man accompanying gentlefolk on a tour that labourers
               would never be able to take by themselves, let alone in such company—led him to see
               and say things that escaped most other Wye tourists. There is, for example, a brilliant
               meditation on the mind's relationship to place and time. Bloomfield had read and admired
               <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>: his Wye poem may eschew the first-person self-analysis of Wordsworth's famous Tintern
               lines, but it nevertheless also considers the effects on the reflective mind of recalling
               a spot of natural beauty and human history. In climactic verses on ruined <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Raglan">Raglan castle</a>, once the last stronghold of the Royalists in the Civil War, Bloomfield first evokes
               the triumph of nature over man's achievements, however violent and heroic they once
               were: </p>

            <p> The ivy embraces the stone; as the castle moulders, the plant prospers, until the
               monuments of martial valour are encased in a 'wilderness of leaves' and the sounds
               of human life give way to the stifling constriction of the creeper. These are sophisticated
               verses that demonstrate how much could still be achieved in the Augustan rhyming couplet.
               Partly this is a matter of allusion: Milton's serpent Satan is not far behind the
               snake-like plant that 'with pride upheaves' itself at the tower's expense. It's also
               a result of lexical vividness, rhetorical insistence and syntactical energy creating
               urgency: Bloomfield pressures his reader to feel awed and threatened by a nature that,
               in the figure of the ivy, represents the triumphant and vampiric power of death, supporting
               itself on the works of mankind. Yet, encasing the crumbling masonry, the ivy also
               configures a natural, growing memorial to a defunct human edifice. This is a post-Edenic
               fallen world, where nature is both beautiful (as in the glossiness of the leaves)
               and menacing because time, death and—in Miltonic terms—sin are fundamental to its
               growth. It is a world, too, in which nature and humanity (here represented by historical
               monuments to human deeds and achievements) are at odds.</p>
            <p>It is now that Bloomfield ventures a meditation on time, history and nature that is
               akin to Wordsworth's and that may represent his response to reading <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>: </p>

            <p> '[O]ne solemn hour / . . . / Is pregnant with a thousand joys' is verbally close
               to Wordsworth's 'One impulse from a vernal wood / May teach you more of man, / Of
               moral evil and of good, / Than all the sages can' from 'The Tables Turned', although
               for Bloomfield it is the encounter with nature's overwhelming of humanity's works,
               rather than solely with its beauty, that makes visiting the spot so endlessly educative.
               The surprising word here is 'joys': as in Wordsworth's 'Tintern Abbey' the visitor
               unexpectedly derives joys from a scene that should, because it reveals the passing
               of time, produce melancholy. This is, then, no simplistic sightseeing event, no mere
               touristic picturesque, but a complex response that finds, as the paradoxical one/thousand
               phrasing suggests, a plenum of emotions and thoughts from a brief encounter. These
               emotions and thoughts are joys, despite the evidence of destruction that gives rise
               to them, because they fertilise a human activity that turns out to be less vulnerable
               to time than castles and towers are—the activity of reflection that vivifies the mind
               and restores the past in memory and that, though it may die with us, survives, in
               the form of 'legends' and tradition, as the stories, songs and poems that we make
               and that others repeat after us. And these, implicitly, renew the 'carols of joy'
               that long-dead denizens of the castle once sang with 'beauty's tongue'. This, of course,
               is an implicit poetic; Bloomfield was adding another turn to the traditions, legends
               and songs that allow us to redeem from oblivion the works of the past—and redeem ourselves
               as consciousnesses destined for oblivion. Carolling joyfully in the poem, he retrieves
               the songs of yore from the ivy's clutches. As a response to a Wye-tour this is as
               profound, but not as self-foregrounding, as Wordsworth's in his 'Lines Composed a
               few Miles above Tintern Abbey' to which it compares in its intimation of the ability
               of the human mind to overcome time's depredations when that mind, fertilised by an
               encounter with a temporally-shaped landscape, is prompted to reflect upon itself and
               assert its power of song.</p>
            <p>Profound though it is, Bloomfield's response to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Raglan">Raglan</a> remains isolated, lost in a poem of occasional brilliance that was published without
               its more original lines and without the prose journal and sketches that should have
               accompanied it. Bloomfield missed a chance, owing to his booksellers' reluctance and
               his own inhibiting consciousness of what was proper for a labourer-visitor writing
               at the touring-gentry's behest. As a result it was easy to neglect the merits of his
               Wye: literary criticism, although idealising a fellow nature-poet's imaginative response
               to the Wye valley, damned the poem with faint praise. In the twentieth century, Bloomfield's
               reputation dwindled to nothing. His multimedia Wye texts, now published for the first
               time, show us both that this eclipse was not of his own making and that Wordsworth's
               egotistical sublime was not the only way to bring into being a new and distinctive
               response to landscape. The Wye, in Bloomfield's verse, prose and pictures, produced
               an original, humane and at times profound contribution to the visual and literary
               culture of the early nineteenth century.</p>
