       Castle, but in the eighteenth-century their principal seat was at Badminton House, Chipping
       Sodbury, Gloucestershire. From 1794 they, in conjunction with the 'Kymin Club' comprising

       into a picturesque landscape with rides, a Round Tower equipped with telescopes which

       passed to Sir Reginald Egerton, 1st Baronet, by virtue of his marriage to the Baron's sister.
       In 1784 the hereditary title was revived when their descendant Sir Thomas Egerton, 7th
       Baronet, was created Baron Grey de Wilton of Wilton Castle. On his death in 1804, three years
       before Bloomfield passed the castle, the Barony of Grey de Wilton became extinct, there being

        year 1770</title>. This was illustrated with plates based on Gilpin's sketches, etched by
       his nephew William Sawrey Gilpin using the new aquatint process. Discussing the aesthetic
       qualities of the Wye valley, Gilpin initiated an aesthetic movement (the picturesque) that
       centred on Herefordshire, its chief proponents being two wealthy landowners of the Wye and
       Teme valleys, Uvedale Price and Richard Payne Knight. Bloomfield and his companions were
       familiar with Gilpin's book and occasionally discussed its principles (Bloomfield preferred
       Gray's response to the river). In sketching as they went, they continued a fashion for
       amateur sketching tours that Gilpin had helped popularise. </gloss>

       educated in London and served Richard II and later Henry Bolingbroke (who became Henry IV) in
       battle. In 1400 he rebelled against Henry with such success that in 1404 he was crowned
       Prince of Wales and, with the English largely driven out, announced his plan for an
       independent Wales with a parliament, universities and separate Welsh church. Though by 1412
       the military campaign of Prince Henry (later Henry V) brought that plan to ruin, forcing
       Owain's allies to surrender their castles, he himself was never captured, his later life and
       death remaining obscure. A romantic figure, owing in part to Shakespeare's portrayal of him
