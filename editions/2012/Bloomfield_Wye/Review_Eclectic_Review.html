            <p class="noCount">The Banks of the Wye, a Poem, in four Books. By Robert Bloomfield, Author of the Farmer's
               Boy. Foolscap 8vo, pp. 134. price 5s. Vernor and Co. and Longman and Co. 1811.</p>
            <p>THE name of Robert Bloomfield is probably known to all our readers, and many must
               be acquainted with his poetry. Eight years ago the Farmer's Boy was as much in fashion,
               as the Lady of the Lake is now. A century hence, we presume, they will both be equally
               known, though differently esteemed: - for we will not bring two works so intrinsically
               dissimilar into further comparison, nor by this conjecture, which cannot be confuted
               in our own time, would we pretend to place their opposite merits on a level. It has
               been the misfortune of the author of the Farmer's Boy, to be exalted above his deserts
               at the beginning of his career, and, according to the natural course of things in
               this perverse world, to be depreciated as much below them, in the sequel, by those,
               especially, who assume to be the keepers of the public conscience in matters of taste.
               His country muse resembled the country lass, whom he describes so charmingly in his
               Rural Tales; </p>

                  <div class="indent3">'No meadow-flower rose fresher to the view,</div>

            </blockquote>
            <p> Thus the public fell in love with the simple Suffolk Muse at first sight: and turning
               to look after her when she was passed by, praised her gait, her shape, her countenance
               and air as quite enchanting and unrivalled. But meeting her frequently in the walks
               of Parnassus, and deeming her less fascinating at every interview, that public, whose
               affections are more inconstant than the clouds that change colour in every light,
               and form in every breeze, soon discerned her homeliness of feature, rusticity of accent,
               and inelegance of manners. Hence, though familiarity has not bred contempt, her modest
               charms have been long ago so much eclipsed by the dazzling pretensions of higher born
               and higher gifted rivals, that few comparatively now behold her with the partiality
               of Walter to Jane in his first love.</p>
            <p>But though the poem of the Farmer's Boy was almost borne down with the panegyrics
               that ushered it into the world, the good genius of the author weathered the gale;
               and so far it was a fortunate circumstance for him to have been trumpeted into notice
               by Mr. Capel Lofft, since he had worth enough to survive the praises of his patron,
               - praises so indiscreet and extravagant, that, unless he had possessed powers of rare
               excellence, (very different indeed in kind and degree from those absurdly ascribed
               to him,) he must have sunk under the ridicule of unmerited encomiums. A few words
               will serve to characterize those merits, which have rescued the name of the most humble
               poet, from the imprudence of the most ostentatious patron, of the age. </p>
            <p>In description, the poetry of Robert Bloomfield is peculiarly pleasing; because it
               presents images and pictures, both of living and inanimate nature, which every eye
               recognizes at first view, and which often occasion not only an emotion of delight
               at finding them in verse, but of surprise, that, although they were perfectly familiar
               to us, the originals themselves never touched us so exquisitely before as the poet's
               representation of them does now. Of this kind are the minute and lively notice of
               the insects in the grass, - the flight of the skylark, - the nocturnal thunder-storm,
               - the swine alarmed by wild ducks, - and many others; in which the simplest circumstances
               strike the mind with all the effect of novelty. In sentiment, we find little beyond
               common-place moralizing which, after all, is the most permanently affecting, when
               plainly and fervently enforced, as we frequently meet with it in the Farmer's Boy;
               - not to mention that ordinary feelings and reflections are the best, nay, the only
               proper ones, which the scenes and situations are calculated to excite in such actors
               or sufferers as are introduced by this writer. It is also the great excellence and
               advantage of Robert Bloomfield, that he always paints from his own eye, and writes
               from his own heart. His personages are all real, not imaginary: they are of the same
               class in life with himself; and have, if we may so express it, the same <em>sensorium</em> of knowledge and observation. Of most poets the very reverse must be said, - not
               in their disparagement, but as a matter of fact. They seldom pourtray their friends
               and companions, express their own unsophisticated feelings, or exhibit the scenery
               of their particular neighbourhood, as endeared to their remembrance from infancy to
               youth. Kings and heroes, men with whom they never conversed, except in books, - foreign
               lands and foreign manners, which they never saw, are the favourite themes of those
               who, in their reveries, create an ideal world, and people it with beings, which they
               can only conceive to have existed in fancied regions, under fabled circumstances.
               Truth, plain truth, - nature, undisfigured nature, are the perpetual objects of desire,
               pursuit, and admiration in Robert Bloomfield's poems. </p>

            <p> is the honest exclamation of our rustic bard, in a beautiful little poem, intitled
               Love of the Country, and published in his volume of Wild Flowers: it might be the
               motto of all his works. – We need only add, that his versification is, on the whole,
               easy and agreeable, though less so in his lyrical stanzas than in the heroic couplets.</p>
            <p>In his Rural Tales, the author has happily succeeded in an attempt to render the loves
               and joys, the sports and manners, of English peasants, interesting. Before him we
               do not recollect any poet, who, by a serious, unaffected delineation of humble life,
               as it actually exists in our own country, had awakened a strong sympathy in persons
               more fortunately circumstanced towards the lowest class of the community. In Goldsmith's
               Deserted Village, much entertainment is afforded, and compassion excited, by the inimitable
               skill of the poet in displaying the characters, pastimes, and injuries of the inhabitants
               of his favourite Auburn: but still the reader <em>condescends</em> to be pleased, or to pity; - there is little of <em>fellow</em>-feeling in the case. Gay and others, who have pretended to celebrate rural swains
               and maidens, have always degraded them by a mixture of the <em>ludicrous</em> with the <em>true</em>, to give spirit to their delineations; thereby rendering what might have been natural
               and affecting, grotesque and amusing. Richard and Kate, Walter and Jane, and the Miller's
               Maid, therefore, are unique and original poems, which, by representing them as they
               really are, have rescued the English peasantry from unmerited reproach, and raised
               them to an equality with their Scottish neighbours, whose character, in verse at least,
               is associated with all that is romantic in love, or delightful in song.</p>
            <p>Of the volume before us we need not say much. The title will apprize the reader that
               its beauties must be principally descriptive. In sentiment and character little will
               be expected. Of the latter, indeed, there is almost nothing; but of the former there
               are occasionally pathetic and impressive passages, inspired by the views of the mountain-scenery,
               new to the eye of a Suffolk bard, and by the presence of magnificent ruins, the wreck
               of ages. Yet the chief deficiency of the poem is, not so much that its merits are
               nearly confined to description, but that the description itself is so local and particular,
               that readers who are unacquainted with the places <em>named</em> and spoken of as if <em>present</em> or <em>well-known</em>, will be dissatisfied with the unreal pictures of them which they can form in their
               own minds: while those who <em>are</em> familiar with the lovely and romantic borders of the Wye, may be still less pleased
               with slight and hasty sketches of rocks, ruins, fields and villages and hills, which
               the poet is enabled to catch, by mist or moonlight, in sunshine or shadow, as he glides
               among them in his boat, and admires them from the bosom of the stream. With these
               inevitable imperfections and disadvantages, the poem is not less entertaining in form
               and sprightly execution than might reasonably be required at the hands of the unassuming
               author, who has made it as good as the subject would let him. For what but diversified
               exhibitions of similar objects could be expected from the poetical log book of a fresh-water
               sailor, in a ten days voyage of pleasure, on a narrow river, whose banks presented
               a succesion of evanescent landscapes, - opening and receding, mingling and losing
               themselves in each other? — The following is a fair average specimen of the versification
               and plan of the work. </p>

            <p> A harvest-day, as it appears to a traveller rapidly passing through the country,

            <p>We shall be thought very superficial critics, if we do not point out some of the thousand

            <p> Had this question been asked from any better motive than idle bravery, the author
               would not have mounted his horse till it had been answered to his satisfaction, lest
               he should ignorantly break God's commandment concerning the sabbath.</p>
            <p>We shall quote one more passage, wherein the poet, - tracing the Wye from its fountain,
               in a fairy voyage down its course, - displays more ingenuity of thought and liveliness
               of fancy than will be found in an equal compass in all his works. </p>

            <p> In the fourth line of the above quotation the reader will observe "<em>share</em>" for "<em>shares</em>," in the third person singular of the verb. The same fault occurs twice at p. 26;
               where Coldwell rocks by it are made to <em>reflect their own forms</em>, and even to <em>shake their shadows</em>. Other grammatical inaccuracies appear, which, we hope, will be corrected in the
               next edition. Several songs, &amp;c. are interspersed with the narrative, of very moderate
               merit, and with very indifferent effect. The volume is embellished with a few engravings.</p>
