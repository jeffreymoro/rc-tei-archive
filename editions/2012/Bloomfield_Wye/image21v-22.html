                     the Mr Owen, a Bookseller in London. The figure is evidently landing from a Corricle,
                     and introducing a plough. I should be glad of a translation of the Welch inscription
                     by any one who may be able. // Celtic Inscription round the verge of the engraving
                     / 'Hu Gadarn conducting the Cymry* into the Island of Britain.' / The inscription
                     beneath the plate. / —'Hu Gadarn upon account of his excellent qualities, was called
                     the Pillar of the Nation. He first conducted the Cymry into Britain from the land
                     of Hav or Deffrobani. those who attended were called the gentle tribe, because Hu
                     would not possess the land by fighting and contention. He was call'd the inoffensive
                     leader, because he gave his tribe the possession of land in justice and peace—The
                     Instructor, because he first taught the race of Cymry to plough the land in Deffrobani—the
                     primary Regulator, because he first settl'd them in society—the inventor of Art, because
                     he first adopted the Oral art to the preservation of memorial and record.'— / Friends
                     of the Island of Britain. / *The ancient Welsh,</a></figcaption><img src="../images/f21v.jpg" alt="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;" class="graphic" style=" width:725px;"/></figure>
