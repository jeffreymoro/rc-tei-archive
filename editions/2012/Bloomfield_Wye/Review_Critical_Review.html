            <p class="noCount">ART. IV—The Banks of the Wye, a Poem, in four Books. By Robert Bloomfield, Author
               of the Farmer's Boy. London, Vernor and Co. and others, 1811. 12mo. pp. 134. price
               5s. Plates.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS it may be said, observes Mr. Bloomfield, that because much of public approbation
               has fallen to my lot, it may be unwise to venture again. If Mr. B. writes chiefly
               for emolument, this objection must <em>cease</em>; if for reputation, we must unite ourselves to those who would impeach his wisdom
               on the present occasion. His poetical character, though widely blazoned by the trump
               of fame, is not of that very exalted nature to make experiment dangerous; there is
               nevertheless one consideration, which he should bear in mind; namely, that the public
               have a right, on hearing of a new poem from an author, who was a creature of their
               own, to expect a very visible improvement in those points, in which there were some
               deficiencies on a former occasion. To that public, and to those who introduced him
               to it, Mr. Bloomfield will be found wanting in due deference, should he be proved,
               now that he ventures upon a new poem—</p>

               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p>A greater ease in composition is undoubtedly evident on the present occasion; but
               an increased intimacy with the machinery of poetry is another point, which might reasonably
               be expected. That Mr. B. does not in reality possess this, we are not prepared to
               assert; but that the present volume contains no symptoms of it, we are compelled to
               declare. The species of poem indeed before us, is such, as almost precludes the possibility
               of displaying any new lights in poetry, which the author may have acquired; but will
               not this very choice of style, and subject, be an argument to some minds, that the
               strength of that pinion, of which so much was prophesied, neither is nor will be able
               to rise nearer to the summit of Parnassus, than it did at its first essay? To no writers
               can the old Latin adage of 'non progredi est regredi' be applied with greater truth,
               than to those whose first popularity arose from the same combination of circumstances
               as those of the present author's; since those readers, who are disappointed in subsequent
               attempts, will begin to suspect that they augured too highly from the first. Having
               given this counsel to our author, which will, we trust, be received in the same spirit
               of justice, which has dictated it, we proceed to his poem. It is little else than
               a journal in easy rhyme of an excursion in South Wales, with occasional apostrophes
               to objects, which excited more than ordinary attention, and a few historical allusions,
               which were recalled to the memory of the places visited. The metre is that which Swift
               has recommended by his example for epistolary verse, a jingle of eight syllables,
               well adapted, by its natural carelessness, for a fable, a ballad, a burlesque, or
               a detail of common occurrences, but which has seldom proved equal to the task of conducting
               a reader through a poem of any length, where much description of scenery is attempted.
               Mr. Scott has indeed given an entirely new character and consequence to this verse;
               yet, notwithstanding the peculiar beauties in which he has clothed it, it has more
               than once been objected even against him. In Mr. Bloomfield's hands it has not the
               same merits, and wears much too great an air of familiarity with the reader, not unfrequently,
               as we shall see, degenerating into vulgarity.</p>
            <p class="indent1">In the summer of 1807, some of the author's friends, resident in Gloucestershire,
               proposed this excursion, and included him in their party. The little tour occupied
               a fortnight: As Mr. B. had never before seen romantic scenery, the effect produced
               on his mind was proportionably greater. The route pursued was by descending the Wye
               from Ross to Chepstow, from which latter place an excursion was made into other parts
               of Monmouthshire, and the neighbouring county of Wales. On these materials the present
               poem is formed, and we would, by no means, have our readers leave us with the idea,
               that we conceive it devoid of merit. Its descriptions are faithful, the versification
               easy and natural; the thoughts, though seldom very original, fairly dressed out, and
               the plan remarkably inartificial. That the poet should not have chosen a subject,
               the formation of which required more machinery, we have regretted; but having chosen
               the present one, we approve of the simplicity of design in its execution. We will
               quote the author's farewell to the scenery of Monmouthshire as a very favourable specimen
               of his work.</p>

            <p>We are truly sorry that we could multiply these instances of bathos. In this conclusion
               of our article, we wish not to have our meaning mistaken, when we say, that we have
               felt some disapprobation, not only at the peculiar faults which we have noticed; but
               at opening a volume, which must rather depress than exalt the poetical character of
               its author. To the tourist on the Wye, it will be a pleasant companion; or to those,
               who recollect the scenes which are here delineated: to the lover of poetry, there
               are some things which will give pleasure; but to the observer of progressive genius,
               the work, as a whole, will bring a degree of disappointment. The 'Farmer's Boy' was
               a very extraordinary effort of unrefined genius; but like many other poems, it suffered
               unfairly from being praised too highly. There were however many, by whom its merits
               were justly appreciated. Bloomfield's minor poems, his tales, &amp;c. are, we think, very
               unequal to his first poem. Rural scenery is beyond all doubt his strong hold. He has
               judged well, then, we may be told, in continuing to offer us a poetic landscape. To
               this we can only reply, that by so doing he certainly shields himself from the risk
               of much critical censure; but, at the same time, he does not even attempt to mount
               one step higher on the ladder of fame. Numerous are the subjects and kinds of poetry,
               which, although not professedly descriptive of scenery, admit of it in due proportions;
               and we wish that Mr. B. had made some experiment of this nature. The present volume
               will, we fear, lead to the conclusion, unless he speedily contradicts it, that his
               muse possesses no capacity for the higher flights of imagination. There are a few
               plates, which, with the exception of the frontispiece, are tolerably executed.</p>
