                     began taking parties of friends downstream on his river boat to admire the scenery.
                     In the wake of Gilpin's <em>Observations on the Wye</em>, the practice gave rise to a commercial tourist trade. By the time of Bloomfield's
                     tour, there were eight boats making regular excursions, most of them hired from inns
                     in the town.</span></li>

                     in wood. At this time the troops at Y Gaer included Vettonian cavalry from Spain.
