            </header>
            <p class="noCount">This edition presents a rare surviving example of the kind of multimedia production
               that arose from one of the new cultural activities of the late eighteenth century—the
               picturesque and antiquarian tour. It comprises a facsimile of the manuscript sketch-
               and scrap-book that Robert Bloomfield made after his 1807 tour of the Wye, an annotated
               transcription of the prose tour-journal that he incorporated into his scrap book,
               and a collated and annotated text of the poetic versions of the tour that were published
               (as <em>The Banks of Wye</em>) in 1811, 1813, and 1823. Also included are reproductions of the engravings that
               illustrated the 1811 and 1813 publications, deleted or unadopted passages from the
               manuscript of the poem, and a selection of reviews from journals of the time. The
               whole represents a visually and verbally rich response to the fashionable tour of
               the Wye. Bloomfield’s manuscript sketch- and scrap-book is an example of the newly
               popular fashion for on-the-spot sketching. Full of self-penned images of views and
               ruins, it is a fine example of the visual culture that the English gentry began to
               produce and to value, a homemade book to pass around in drawing rooms before turning
               either to the latest set of engravings published by Mr Turner or to the poetic tour
               — <em>The Banks of Wye</em> — that Bloomfield himself issued in print. Bloomfield, indeed, hoped to issue not
               just the poetic tour but also the ‘whole triple-page’d Journal, Drawings, prose, and
               rhime’. Cost prohibited such a publication at the time: only now, with this composite
               edition of poem, prose, scrap- and sketch-book, can we see the multimedia response
               to the Wye that was then accessible only to the intimate friends among whom the manuscript
               circulated.</p>

            </header>
            <p class="noCount">In preparing this edition I have followed the format of <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters">the edition of Bloomfield’s letters that I produced for Romantic Circles</a> in collaboration with Lynda Pratt. The texts of the poem and the prose journal are
               fully annotated, with hyperlinks taking readers to documents identifying the people
               and the places mentioned therein. Facsimile reproductions of the pages of the manuscript
               journal are accessible both via hyperlinks from the transcription of the journal and
               from the List of Figures to be found in the Contextual Materials section of the site.
               A Bibliography, a List of Manuscripts, and a document containing unpublished drafts
               of the poem, transcribed from manuscript, are also to be found in the Contextual Materials
               section. A selection of contemporary reviews is also included there.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Bloomfield 's original spelling, and mis-spelling, grammar and punctuation has been
               retained. Deletions are indicated by striking through the deleted word or phrase,
               but without any attempt to indicate the heaviness of the deletion. Throughout the
               text, 'x' is used to indicate an illegible character: e.g. 'he xxid'. Underlining
               is indicated by italics: e.g. '<em>he said</em>'. Editorial &lt;...&gt; are used to indicate an authorial insertion of text above or below
               the line.</p>

               several monographs and articles in which Bloomfield features, including <em>Literature, Science and Exploration in the Romantic Era: Bodies of Knowledge</em> (2004). He edited <em>Thalaba the Destroyer</em>, vol. 3 of <em>Robert Southey: Poetical Works, 1793-1810</em> (2004) and is co-general editor, with Lynda Pratt, of the forthcoming <em>Robert Southey: Later Poetical Works, 1811-1838</em>.

            <p class="noCount">This electronic edition was TEI-encoded by Jason Whitaker in liaison with Laura Mandell
               and her team at Miami University of Ohio, and with the assistance of David Rettenmaier
               at the University of Maryland. The image associated with this edition was designed
               by Michael Quilligan at the University of Maryland, and includes elements from illustrations
               from this volume. Mandell transformed the TEI files into HTML by using modified versions
               of the transforms provided by the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</a>. The HTML pages do not use frames but rather make extensive use of tables and stylesheets
