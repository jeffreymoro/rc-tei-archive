                     the Royal Society. Sir Joseph was also an improving agriculturalist with extensive
                     estates in Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire. A generous patron of landscape artists,
                     whom he took with him on tours of Scotland, the Wye, Iceland and, with Captain Cook,

                     (1744-1803) and then by Henry Charles Somerset, 6th Duke of Beaufort (1766-1835).
                     They were descendants of the Earls and Marquesses of Worcester, of Raglan Castle,
                     but in the eighteenth-century their principal seat was at Badminton House, Chipping
                     Sodbury, Gloucestershire. From 1794 they, in conjunction with the 'Kymin Club' comprising
                     local gentlemen, turned their land at Beaulieu woods and the Kymin, on the Wye near
                     Monmouth, into a picturesque landscape with rides, a Round Tower equipped with telescopes
                     which commanded views of nine counties, and a Naval Pavilion commemorating British

                     Poland, Russia, Sweden and Denmark. A tutor of the sons of wealthy gentlemen and an

               <li class="item" id="d9762e524"><span style="font-weight:bold" id="DeWilton">De Wilton: </span> <span class="gloss">Wilton Castle, on the bank of the Wye near Ross, was the seat of the Barons Grey de
                     Wilton from the thirteenth century, when Reginald De Grey became its lord, to 1603
                     when the fifteenth Baron was attainted and his title forfeited. The castle then passed
                     to Sir Reginald Egerton, 1st Baronet, by virtue of his marriage to the Baron's sister.
                     In 1784 the hereditary title was revived when their descendant Sir Thomas Egerton,
                     7th Baronet, was created Baron Grey de Wilton of Wilton Castle. On his death in 1804,
                     three years before Bloomfield passed the castle, the Barony of Grey de Wilton became
                     extinct, there being no sons to inherit it. </span></li>
               <li class="item" id="d9762e532"><span style="font-weight:bold" id="GilpinWilliam">Gilpin, William (1724-1804): </span> <span class="gloss">Anglican clergyman, amateur artist, tourist and theorist of the picturesque in his
                     tour journals circulated in manuscript to friends including Thomas Gray. In 1782,
                     Gilpin published <em>Observations on the River Wye and several parts of South Wales, etc. relative chiefly
                        to Picturesque Beauty; made in the summer of the year 1770</em>. This was illustrated with plates based on Gilpin's sketches, etched by his nephew
                     William Sawrey Gilpin using the new aquatint process. Discussing the aesthetic qualities
                     of the Wye valley, Gilpin initiated an aesthetic movement (the picturesque) that centred
                     on Herefordshire, its chief proponents being two wealthy landowners of the Wye and
                     Teme valleys, Uvedale Price and Richard Payne Knight. Bloomfield and his companions
                     were familiar with Gilpin's book and occasionally discussed its principles (Bloomfield
                     preferred Gray's response to the river). In sketching as they went, they continued
                     a fashion for amateur sketching tours that Gilpin had helped popularise.</span></li>
               <li class="item" id="d9762e544"><span style="font-weight:bold" id="GlendowerOwen">Glendower, Owen (Owain Glyndwr) (c. 1354 or 1359 - c. 1416): </span> <span class="gloss">a Marcher Lord, born into the Anglo-Welsh gentry, who was educated in London and served
                     Richard II and later Henry Bolingbroke (who became Henry IV) in battle. In 1400 he
                     rebelled against Henry with such success that in 1404 he was crowned Prince of Wales
                     and, with the English largely driven out, announced his plan for an independent Wales
                     with a parliament, universities and separate Welsh church. Though by 1412 the military
                     campaign of Prince Henry (later Henry V) brought that plan to ruin, forcing Owain's
                     allies to surrender their castles, he himself was never captured, his later life and
                     death remaining obscure. A romantic figure, owing in part to Shakespeare's portrayal
                     of him in <em>Henry IV</em> parts I and II, he remains a national hero in Wales.</span></li>

                     he kept no journal, his enthusiastic notes about the scenery and antiquities were
                     published after his death as <em>A Catalogue of the Antiquities, Houses, Parks, Plantations, Scenes, and Situations,
                        in England and Wales</em> (1773) and republished in pocket-size for the tourist in 1799 as <em>Traveller's Companion, in a Tour Through England and Wales; Containing a Catalogue

                     him on the Wye tour, which was organised for his benefit, and afterwards encouraged
