                  himself on shore, jumps out, and takes his boat at his back with great ease. It had
                  a strange and even laughable appearance; It was impossible to keep the mind at home;

            <p class="noCount">The whole of this morning was spent in a thorough examination of the Ruin'd Castle,
               but the time was too short; Many good drawings were made, and I attempted one amongst
               the rest; The joists of the floors in <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#MartensTower">Martin's Tower</a> are still existing and are of solid Oak, about a foot square. It appears unaccountable
               to me how, even by the lapse of ages, nutriment enough can be found for shrubs of
               so large a growth as are flourishing between the outer and inner ramparts of these
               towers, and on the top of the wall of course. This gangway, once the place of the
               defenders of the fortress and its centinels, is now an absolute wild: a mixture of
               Brambles, Hazel, Ash, Beech, and fruit trees, from twenty to thirty feet high at least.
               The whole area of the Chappel which I was much taken with, (though the man in attendance
               called it the banqueting-room) is coverd with thriving underwood. The look out from
               its large windows must have been allmost dreadful, as that wall stands on, and is,

               in a kind of cellaring, the archd way leading to which has partly fallen in, a country

               part she was inclined to believe with many of her neighbours, that the devil was there.
               In this building a gigantic stem of Ivy has pushed awry the fine fluted work of the
               kitchen window, and seems to set iron and stone at defiance. The largest elm I have

               the best way would be to hire a carriage on purpose, that would carry half our party.

               is perhaps, one of those we might call yeomen, or what in the north are termd, statesmen.

                  In this style, the whole cavalcade left the Angel Inn at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Abergavenny">Abergany</a>, and excited a great deal of mirth. The roads up the mountain are such as nothing

                  sometimes is. We reach'd the top of the woody part of this high ground, and then had
                  a fairer view of the peak, or summit of the Sugar Loaf '<a class="link_ref" href="places.html#SugarLoaf">Pen y Vale</a>,' which I understand to mean the 'head of the vale' and which sombody has since baptized
                  by the more melting name of the '<a class="link_ref" href="places.html#SugarLoaf">Sugar-loaf</a>.' I here took to my feet and steerd directly for the summit, while most of the party
                  went slowly round with the cart: But young purnell Cooper rode his <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CooperRobert">father's</a> horse, amidst the rocks and fragments allmost to the summit, where the poor animal
                  trembled and neigh'd for his companions. I gained the brow by regular and temperate
                  exertion, for I had learned a lesson from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#SymondsYat">Symmons' Yat</a>, gathering whimburys or winberrys in my way and resting on the grotesque and immense
                  fragments of Rocks, which appear to have rolled down from the top; which is compos'd
                  of allmost entire rock, and is not a sharp, but a long narrow ridge, of about one
                  hundred yards wide.

               this sublime eminence the eye ranges over others still higher, and the &lt;blue mists

               I think that mirth would be the last feeling likely to be excited in such a situation.
               The air was remarkably fresh and invigorating; some few drops of rain fell, which
               were most likely not known in the country below. We left the summit with regret. At
               a considerable way from the more rocky part of the hill, in our descent, a cloth was
