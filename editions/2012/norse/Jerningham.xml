            <head>Edward Jerningham (1737–1812)</head>
            <p>Edward Jerningham was a gentleman poet, descended from an old Catholic family
                    settled in  Norfolk. Jerningham’s poetry, such as “The
                    Nunnery” (1762), “An Elegy Written among the Ruins  of an
                    Abbey (1765), and “The Funeral of Arabert, Monk of La Trappe”
                    (1771), show the influence  of Thomas Gray. These poetic pieces focus on typical Gothic subjects of women in distress, suicidal  lovers and doomed passion
                    within cloisters. It thus comes as no surprise that Jerningham considered 
                    Horace Walpole a life-long mentor. The two men met in Paris in 1765, and Walpole
                    continued to be  an inspiration to Jerningham long after. Jerningham
                    dedicated “The Rise and Progress of the  Scandinavian Poetry”
                    to his mentor, when it was included in the 1786 edition of his <hi rend="ital">Poems</hi>.  Walpole praised <hi rend="ital">The Rise and Progress of
                        Scandinavian Poetry</hi> as “far superior to his other works”,
                     although it fell short of conjuring up “the most forceful feelings
                    as Gray has done in a subject in  which there is so much of the
                        terrible”.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="1">

                                Letters of Horace Walpole</hi>, ed. by P. Cunningham, vol. 8

            </p>
            <p>Jerningham was frequently a victim of satire for his polished verses, such as in
                    Thomas James  Mathias’ satire <hi rend="ital">The Pursuits of
                        Literature</hi>, where the poet – infamous for his laments on
                    deserted  sheep –is referred to as “sillier than his
                        sheep”.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="2">

                    his sentimental style did evoke the  interest of the poetic circle known as
                    the Della Cruscans.</p>

               <hi rend="ital">The Rise and Progress of the Scandinavian Poetry</hi> is divided
                    into two quite unequal parts. The first  (which is included here)
                    celebrates the Norse mythology as a storehouse of poetic images. 
                    Jerningham tracks the flight of the Norse muse who flies over scenes from the
                        <hi rend="ital">Poetic Edda</hi> and  images known from skaldic poetry.
                    Among the observations made are several images that were  already rehearsed
                    in Norse-inspired poetry by the mid-1780s.</p>
            <p>The second part (not included here) is about a pagan chapel in Uppsala, which was
                    destroyed in  1075 and a Christian chapel erected there some forty years
                    later. This is used as an allegory of how  Scandinavian poetry adopted new
                    imagery and left the “wild conceptions” of former times to fall
                     into disuse. This is what constitutes the later “progress”
                    of Scandinavian poetry, as described in the  title.</p>
            <p>The poem was generally considered one of the more successful of
                    Jerningham’s efforts. <hi rend="ital">The  Monthly Review</hi> saw
                    Jerningham’s efforts to use Scandinavian mythology for “the
                    purposes of  modern poetry” as a failure, but also believed that
                    some images did contain “a kind of savage  sublimity”.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="3">

                            the third fable of the Edda, are these words, “a powerful Being
                            had with his breath animated the drops out  of which the first
                            giant was formed. This Being, whom the Edda affects not to name, was
                            entirely distinct from Odin, who  had his birth long after the
                            formation of the giant Ymir.”—</hi>

                            name, is supposed, in the following Poem, to create, from his  own
                            immediate power, the system of the Scaldic mythology. As it would have
                            been impossible to introduce the whole system  without running into
                            a tedious enumeration, the principal features of it are only retained,
                            sufficient (it is presumed) to give  some idea of the character of
                            the northern poetry. Among other omissions the reader will find that no

                            of war and enterprise which runs through the whole Scandinavian
