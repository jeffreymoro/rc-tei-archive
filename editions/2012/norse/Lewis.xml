            <head>Matthew Gregory Lewis (1775–1818)</head>
            <p>Matthew Lewis is best remembered for <hi rend="ital">The Monk</hi> (1796), one of
                    the most influential, and  controversial, Gothic novels in English. This
                    novel was written in ten weeks and published before  he was twenty. He was
                    a Member of Parliament for Wiltshire; his interests were not in politics, but
                     in literature and the stage. His <hi rend="ital">The Castle Spectre</hi>
                    (1797) was a popular stage play, which enjoyed a  long run. He also
                    translated a number of works from German, such as <hi rend="ital">The
                        Minister</hi> (1797, a  translation from Friedrich Schiller’s
                        <hi rend="ital">Kabale und Liebe</hi>).</p>
            <p>Lewis became deeply influenced by German literature in July 1792, when he
                    travelled to Saxe-  Weimar-Eisenach (where Sir Brooke Boothby was British
                    ambassador to the court of Duke Karl  August) to prepare himself for a
                    diplomatic career in accordance with his father’s wishes. During 
                    his stay, he developed an interest in folklore, mediated through Johann
                    Gottfried von Herder, whose 
                    <hi rend="ital">Volkslieder</hi> (Leipzig, 1778–9), contained a number of
                    Scandinavian songs and poems.</p>
            <p>The text of “The Water King” was first incorporated into <hi rend="ital">The Monk</hi>, among a number of other  passages drawing on
                    folklore. It appears as a song performed outside the convent of St. Clare, 
                    Spain, where a subplot of the action takes place. In the lead up to the song,
                    Theodore, Don  Raymond’s faithful page, describes how Danes believe
                    in elemental “Daemons”. The Water–King  is such
                    creature, who wears the appearance of a “Warrior” and
                    “employs himself in luring young  Virgins into his snare”.
                    According to Theodore, the moral of the ballad is the danger “for young
                     Women to abandon themselves to their passions”.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="1"> M. G. Lewis, <hi rend="ital">Ambrosio, or the Monk: A Romance</hi>, 4 rev. ed., vol. 3 (London:
                            J. Bell, 1798), 14–16.</note> The supernatural ballad is here
                    given in a  context, where it plays on the credulity and superstition of
                    the Catholic nuns in the convent. In this  way, it forms part of
                    Lewis’s attacks on Catholicism throughout the novel.</p>
            <p>Lewis translated the poem from Herder’s <hi rend="ital">Volkslieder</hi>
                    collection, where it has the title “Der  Wassermann”. Herder
                    knew the ballad from the Danish collector Anders Sørensen Vedel’s
                        <hi rend="ital">It  Hundrede udvaalde Danske Viser</hi> (1591; <hi rend="ital">One Hundred Selected Ballads</hi>), which was expanded by 
                    Peder Syv with another 100 ballads in 1695, with eight re-printings in the
                    eighteenth century.</p>
            <p>Herder’s ambition was to rediscover the true and authentic voice of
                    national character through  folklore (the collection was later re-titled
                        <hi rend="ital">Stimmen der Völker in Liedern</hi>). But what Lewis
                    provides  is an English version of “Der Wassermann”, which
                    pays little attention to philological principles of  translation. Instead
                    it is a free adaption focussing on the horror of the tale. The theme of
                    abduction  and drowning (only hinted at in the original) are expanded to
                    constitute a long melodrama, to which  are added other shock effects.
                    Nonetheless, Lewis still emphasized the provenance of the song in  genuine
                    folklore, footnoting the piece (in the 1798 edition of <hi rend="ital">The
                        Monk</hi>) with the information that  he has since met with two old
                    Scottish ballads resembling it.</p>
            <p>The “Water King” was reprinted in Lewis’s collection <hi rend="ital">Tales of Wonder</hi> (1801; actually late  1800), a
                    two-volume edition with 60 ballads. The first volume contains original poems and
                    translations by Lewis (17 poems), <ref target="Scott.html">Walter Scott</ref> (5), <ref target="Southey.html">Robert Southey</ref> (8) and
                    others. Lewis included other Danish ballads, “Elvers’s
                    Hoh”, “The Erl-King”, and “The Erl-King’s
                    Daughter”, as well as two Norse songs, <ref target="Seward.html">“The Sword of
                    Angantyr”</ref> and “King Hakon’s Death Song”, all of
                    which Herder  had translated into German.</p>
