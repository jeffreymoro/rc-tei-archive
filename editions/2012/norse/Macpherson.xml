            <head>James Macpherson (1736–1796)</head>
            <p>James Macpherson was a Scottish writer, poet and antiquary, who became
                        notorious for his  “translations” of the third-century
                        Gaelic bard Ossian. Macpherson claimed to have collected the  verses,
                        primarily from oral sources, on tours of the Scottish Highlands. The Ossian
                        poems were  published in the early 1760s. The question of their
                        authenticity soon sparked a heated debate.  Nonetheless, even some of
                        Macpherson’s fiercest detractors could not but acknowledge the poetic
                         craftsmanship of the poems, and they were praised for their invocation
                        of sentiment and the  sublime.</p>
            <p>In a fairly recent article, James Porter has assessed the wealth of critical
                        investigative work into  the sources and traditions that the Ossian
                        poems relied on. He comes to the conclusion that  Macpherson cannot be
                        called an outright forger: what he did was to “adapt genuine
                        material,  arranging it into a pattern that fitted current ideas of
                        epic poetry, ideas that were also moving taste  away from neoclassical
                        models toward a sensibility of feeling”.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="1">James Porter,
                                “Bring Me the Head of James Macpherson”: <hi rend="ital">The Execution of Ossian and the Wellsprings of 
                                    Folkloristic Discourse</hi>”, <hi rend="ital">Journal of
                                    American Folklore</hi> 114 (2001): 396–435, at
                                399–400.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, the Edinburgh professor Hugh Blair, a prolific supporter of
                        Macpherson, wrote in <hi rend="ital">A  Critical Dissertation
                                on the Poems of Ossian</hi> (1763) that Ossian’s
                        warrior code was characterized  by “tenderness, and even
                        delicacy of sentiment, greatly predominant over fierceness and
                        barbarity”.  This he contrasted with the violence of <ref target="./Percy.html">Ragnar
                        Lodbrog’s Death Song</ref>, from which he translated a  large extract.
                        In fact, he purports that turning to Ossian after reading the Norse poem was
                        “like  passing from a savage desart, into a fertile and
                        cultivated country”.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="2">

            <p>In translating the purported Gaelic verses into English, Macpherson chose a
                        high-flown rhythmic  prose. Intentionally, it was a similar style
                        <ref target="./Percy.html">Thomas Percy</ref> chose for the translation of his <hi rend="ital">Five Pieces

            <head>Fragment of a Northern Tale (1773)</head>
            <p>Macpherson first printed this “fragment” of an originally Norse
                        poem in the preface to the collected  poems of Ossian, which came out
                        in 1773. At this time, he was forced into a defensive position. The 
                        Norse piece appears as part of a defence for using English prose to
                        translate what was allegedly  Gaelic verse. The poem seems to be
                        concerned with events Macpherson describes in the revised  edition of
                        his <hi rend="ital">An Introduction to the History of Great Britain and
                            Ireland</hi> (1773), where he recounts  how “Harald
                        Harfager, king of Norway, pursuing his enemies, who had taken refuge in the
                        Scottish  Isles, reduced the Hebrides and the Orkneys”.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="5">James

                        source for this was the Icelandic historian  Thormud Torfæus,
                        who tells us that Orkney and Shetland saw intensive settlements of Norwegian
                         settlers during the late eighth and early ninth centuries. These
                        became a base for Vikings to plunder  the coasts of Scotland and
                        Norway. In response the Norwegian King Harald Fair Hair annexed the 
                        islands in 875.</p>
            <p>As it is entirely characteristic of Macpherson, he obscures the source and
                        provenance of the  poem he presents to the public. This makes it
                        suspect. Nevertheless, other travellers to the northern  regions of
                        Britain also claimed to record specimens of Norse poetry that had been
                        preserved there.  In the year 1774, the Scottish theologian George Low
                        visited Shetland in order to collect material  for a description of the
                        country and was able to take down thirty-five stanzas of the Norn Ballad of

            <head>From the preface to <hi rend="ital">The Poems of Ossian</hi> (1773)</head>
            <p>The following Poems, it must be confessed, are more calculated to please
                        persons of exquisite feelings  of heart, than those who receive all
                        their impressions by the ear. The novelty of cadence, in what is 
                        called a prose version, tho’ not destitute of harmony, will not to
                        common readers supply the absence of  the frequent returns of rhime.
                        This was the opinion of the Writer himself, though he yielded to the 
                        judgment of others, in a mode, which presented freedom and dignity of
                        expression, instead of fetters,  which cramp the thought, whilst the
                        harmony of language is preserved. His intention was to publish in 
                        verse. The making of poetry, like any other handicraft, may be learned by
                        industry; and he had served  his apprenticeship, tho’ in secret,
                        to the muses.</p>
            <p>It is, however, doubtful, whether the harmony which these Poems might derive
                        from rhime, even in  much better hands than those of the Translator,
                        could atone for the simplicity and energy, which they  would lose. The
                        determination of this point shall be left to the readers of this Preface.
                        The following is  the beginning of a Poem, translated from the Norse to
                        the Gaëlic language; and, from the latter,  transferred into
                        English. The verse took little more time to the writer than the prose; and
                        he himself is  doubtful (if he has succeeded in either), which of them
                        is the most literal version.</p>

                             dark on his sides, but calm, above his vast forehead appears.
                            White-issuing from the skirt of his storms,  the troubled torrents
                            pour down his sides. Joining, as they roar along, they bear the Torno,
                            in foam, to  the main.</p>
            <p>Grey on the bank, and far from men, half-covered, by ancient pines, from
                            the wind, a lonely pile exalts  its head, long-shaken by the storms
                            of the north. To this fled Sigurd, fierce in fight, from Harold the
                             leader of armies, when fate had brightened his spear, with renown;
                            when he conquered in that rude  field, where Lulan’s
                            warriors fell in blood, or rose in terror on the waves of the main.
                            Darkly sat the  grey-haired chief; yet sorrow dwelt not in his
                            soul. But when the warrior thought on the past, his proud  heart
                            heaved again his side: forth flew his sword from its place; he wounded
                            Harold in all the winds,</p>
            <p>One daughter, and one only, but bright in form and mild of soul, the last
                            beam of the setting line,  remained to Sigurd of all his race. His
                            son, in Lulan’s battle slain, beheld not his father’s
                            flight from the  foes. Nor finished seemed the ancient line! The
                            splendid beauty of bright-eyed Fithon, covered still the  fallen
                            king with renown. Her arm was white like Gormal’s snow; her bosom
                            whiter than the foam of  the main, when roll waves beneath the
                            wrath of the winds. Like two stars were her radiant eyes, like  two
                            stars that rise on the deep, when dark tumult embroils the night.
                            Pleasant are the beams aloft, as  stately they ascend the
                            skies.</p>
            <p>Nor Odin forgot, in aught, the maid. Her form scarce equalled her lofty
                            mind. Awe moved around her  stately lips. Heroes loved – but
                            shrunk away in their fears. Yet midst the pride of all her charms, her
                             heart was soft and her soul was kind. She saw the mournful with
                            tearful eyes. Transient darkness arose  in her breast. Her joy was
                            in the chase. Each morning, when doubtful light wandered dimly on
                            Lulan’s  waves, she roved the resounding woods, to
                            Gormal’s head of snow. Nor moved the maid alone, &amp;c.</p>
