            <head>Thomas Love Peacock (1785–1866)</head>
            <p>Thomas Love Peacock was employed with the East India Company until his
                        retirement at the age of  70. He began early in his life to write, and
                        throughout his life he published a number of poetry  collections. His
                        first novel, <hi rend="ital">Headlong Hall</hi>, was published in 1815 and
                        was followed by six others,  among them <hi rend="ital">Nightmare
                            Abbey</hi> (1818). They are primarily novels about polite milieus,
                        dominated  by sparkling dialogue, satirizing contemporary ideas. The
                        novels, which he characterized as “comic  romances”,
                        contain some of his most memorable poems. His essay <hi rend="ital">The Four
                            Ages of Poetry</hi> (1820)  was admired by Percy Bysshe Shelley,
                        with whom Peacock had a close friendship.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="ital">Fiolfar</hi> is one of Peacock’s juvenile
                        compositions. He appears to have shown an early interest in  Norse
                        mythology. In the early years of the nineteenth century, Peacock wrote a
                        Norse-inspired play  entitled <hi rend="ital">The Circle of Loda</hi>,
                        a manuscript of which has been preserved among his papers.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="1">This is printed in <hi rend="ital">The Plays of Thomas Love Peacock</hi>, ed. A. B.
                                Young (1912)</note> It was 
                        <hi rend="ital">Fiolfar</hi> which he decided to publish. Peacock was
                        evidently exploring a fashion for Nordic  composition, whose spectrum
                        of references he wanted to expand. He headed the notes to the poem 
                        (some of which have been incorporated here) with the statement:</p>
            <quote>Though the names of Odin and Thor, the Fatal Sisters, and the Hall of
                        Valhalla, be familiar to the  readers of English poetry, yet, as the
                        minutiae of the Gothic Mythology are not very generally  known, I have
                        subjoined a few short explanatory notes, which, though they cannot be
                        expected  to afford much insight into the general system, will, I
                        trust, be sufficient to enable my readers to  comprehend such parts of
                        it, as are alluded to in this poem.</quote>
            <p>
               <hi rend="ital">The Critical Review</hi> showed appreciation of the poem,
