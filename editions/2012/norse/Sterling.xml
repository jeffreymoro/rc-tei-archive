            <head>Joseph Sterling (1765–1794)</head>
            <p>Joseph Sterling was a poet and antiquary, known as the leading Irish
               Spenserian of his generation.  His poetry centred on romance. An example of this is <hi rend="ital">Bombarino, a Romance</hi> (1768), which was an imitation of
                         Tasso, Ariosto, and Spenser. A heroic poem on Richard Coeur de Lion
                        appeared in <hi rend="ital">Poems</hi> (Dublin,  1782) as <hi rend="ital">La Gierusalemme soggettita</hi>, written in Spenserian
                        stanza form. Included in the same  volume are a section of poems
                        labelled <hi rend="ital">Odes from the Icelandic</hi>, including “The
                        Scalder” and “The  Twilight of the Gods”, an
                        imitation of the <hi rend="ital">Völuspá</hi> section of the
                            <hi rend="ital">Poetic Edda</hi>, which deals with 
                        <hi rend="ital">Ragnarök</hi>. This had previously been imitated by
                        <ref target="Mathias.html">Thomas James Mathias</ref>. These were prefaced by a  short
                        “Dissertation”, which spoke of the legend that Odin had
                        emigrated from Asia and praised the  poetry of <ref target="Thomas_Gray">Thomas Gray</ref>. His poems
                        were republished in London in 1789. In the year of Sterling’s 
                        death, a collection of his odes was published.</p>
            <p>Like <ref target="Penrose.html">Thomas Penrose</ref>’s poem, this composition is centrally concerned
                        with the role of the Norse  skald in encouraging warriors on the
                        battlefield. In a “Dissertation”, introducing
                        Sterling’s Norse-inspired poems, the skald’s voice is
                        described with a Romantic sense of loss: “The abilities of the 
                        Scalder may be compared to the rays of passing light, when launched out into
                        the regions of infinite  space, from whence they are never to return,
                        and where their heat and splendour is diffused in vain”  (<hi rend="ital">Poems</hi> 34). The poem focuses on the rewards of the
                        afterlife, which the poet brings into being.  There are two competing
                        visions involved. Sterling explains:</p>
            <quote>The <hi rend="ital">Flath Innis</hi> [also spelled <hi rend="ital">Flaitheas</hi>], or <hi rend="ital">Noble Isle</hi>, is described; it
                        was the paradise of the 
                        <hi rend="ital">Celtæ</hi>, and differed in some particulars from <hi rend="ital">Valhalla</hi>. In the former the mind was not fatigued 
                        with scenes of unvaried carnage; but the imagination was soothed with the
                        most soothing  prospects; the sunny landscape and the murmur of the
                        murmurs of the falling stream, were  contrasted to the glittering
                        amour, and the shock of encountering heroes. (<hi rend="ital">Poems</hi>

            <p>The preoccupation with the differences between Gothic and Celtic religion was
                        almost certainly  inspired by <ref target="./Percy.html">Thomas Percy</ref>’s preface to his
                        translation of Northern Antiquities, in which clear fault  lines were
                        drawn.</p>
            <p>Nathan Drake, an important literary critic, an advocate of vernacular and
                        Gothic poetry, praised  “The Scalder” in the third volume
                        of <hi rend="ital">Literary Hours</hi> (1804). He calls it “a
               beautiful Ode”, and  Sterling’s poetry collection is referred to as “little known, though certainly meriting 
                        considerable applause”. Drake expresses the hope that the reader will
                        “procure the volume”, since  “he will, I have no
                        doubt, be highly gratified in the perusal”.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="1">Nathan Drake, <hi rend="ital">Literary Hours: or, Sketches, Critical, Narrative,
