            <head>Frank L. Sayers (1763–1817)</head>
            <p>Frank L. Sayers was a poet and scholar who settled in Norwich after a failed career in medicine.  Here, he made a lifelong friend in the poet
                        William Taylor (1765–1836). Sayers showed an early  interest in
                        radical politics. However, in later years, he made a shift to conservatism.
                        This was  paralled by a shift in religious opinion from atheism to a
                        dogmatic Anglicanism.</p>
            <p>Upon settling in Norwich, Sayers published <hi rend="ital">Dramatic Sketches
                            of the Ancient Northern  Mythology</hi> (1790). This collection,
                        containing “Moina”, “Starno”, and “The
                        Descent of Freya”,  were published by Joseph Johnson, the
                        radical bookseller. <hi rend="ital">Dramatic Sketches</hi> drew attention
                        both in  England and in Germany, where the blank-verse poems were
                        translated by Valerius Wilhelm  Neubeck (1792–93). In 1792, a
                        revised English second edition (incorporated in his collected 
                        <hi rend="ital">Poems</hi>) was published with several additions (3<hi rendition="#sup">rd</hi> ed. 1803, 4th ed. 1807). It now included two
                         “monodramas”, a drama with only one speaker, which
                        Sayers pioneered and which came to enjoy a  vogue in the 1790s.</p>
            <p>Robert Southey befriended and greatly admired Sayers. In the preface to his
                        epic fantasy 
                        <hi rend="ital">Thalaba</hi>, Southey tells us that he was inspired to his
                        experiment by Sayers’s use of unrhymed,  irregular verse and
                        mythological subject matter in his <hi rend="ital">Dramatic
                            Sketches</hi>.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="1">
                                 Robert Southey, <hi rend="ital">Thalaba, the
                                    Destroyer</hi> (London: Longman et al., 1814),
                                viii–ix.</note>
            </p>
            <p>A slim volume of new poetry, <hi rend="ital">Nugae poeticae</hi>, was
                        revealed in 1803. Here, Sayers began flirting  with humour and parody.
                        A volume of essays, <hi rend="ital">Miscellanies, Antiquarian and
                            Historical</hi> (1805),  shows that Sayers’s interest in
                        antiquarian matters had extended to Anglo-Saxon literature, of which 
                        he included extracts in translation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="ital">The Descent of Frea</hi> deals with the death of the god
                        Balder. In this way, it connects with Thomas  Gray’s “The
                        Descent of Odin”. Sayers praises Gray in his preface to <hi rend="ital">Dramatic Sketches of the  Ancient Northern
                            Mythology</hi> for making use of “the splendid and sublime
                        religion of our Northern  ancestors” in his poetic composition.
                        Northern religion was, after all, one of “the superstitions and 
                        mythologieswhich have contributed at different periods to decorate the
                        poetry of England”  (preface, iii). Among writers who took an
                        interest in Norse mythologies as an inspiration, Balder’s  death
                        was a popular theme. In Denmark, Sayers’s drama had a precursor in
                        Johannes Ewald’s  drama <hi rend="ital">Balders Død</hi>
                        from 1773. <note place="foot" resp="editors" n="2">
                                This was translated as <hi rend="ital">The Death of Balder</hi> by
                                George Borrows in 1889.</note> Sayers’s friend had
                        brought home a German translation of this  drama, which inspired the
                        composition of “The Descent of Frea”.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="3">William Taylor, <hi rend="ital">Some Biographical Particulars</hi>, in <hi rend="ital">Poetical Works</hi> (London: W. Simpkin and R.

            <p>According to Norse myth, Balder had been dreaming about his own death.
                        Therefore, Frigg, his  mother, secured an oath from every creature and
                        object in nature (snakes, metals, diseases, poisons,  fire etc.) that
                        they would not injure Balder. All agreed, except the mistletoe, which Frigg
                        had  thought too small to ask. The trickster Loki was jealous of
                        Balder. Thus, Loki tricked Balder’s blind  twin brother Hod into
                        throwing a mistletoe dart at Balder, which pierced him through his heart,
                         leaving the much-beloved god dead. Frigg sought for one brave enough
                        to face Hel, the mistress of  the underworld, and plead for
                        Balder’s return to the living. The great hero Hermod was chosen. Hel
                         agreed to release Balder on the condition that everything, dead or
                        alive, should weep for Balder. But  since Loki did not weep, Balder had
                        to remain in Hel’s underworld until the end of the world.</p>
            <p>In describing the incident and the gods sending an emissary to Hel, Sayers
                        takes several poetic  liberties. In his version, it is not Heremod, who
                        is sent to Hel, the goddess of death, to plead for  Balder’s
                        return, but Frea, the goddess of beauty.</p>
            <p>The poem contains a long passage on the Northern hell brimming with horror
                        imagery. <hi rend="ital">The  Monthly Review</hi> thought this was so

               <p>The gods of the Northern nations were not, like those of the Greeks,
                            imagined to be immortal; they  were exempted neither from pain nor
                            death, and even those who escaped these evils during a series of 
                            ages, were at length to be destroyed at the last day, or, as it is
                            stiled in the Sagas, “the Twilight of the  Gods:”
                            till that time should arrive, they were supposed to dwell in Valhalla,
                            and to enjoy in a supreme  degree those luxuries and pleasures
                            which the people who worshipped them considered as the most 
                            desirable.</p>
               <p>Balder, the son of Odin, was highly, celebrated among the gods for his
                            exquisite beauty and  consummate eloquence; his office as a deity
                            was to guide the horse of day, called Skinfax, in his diurnal 
                            course, and he is therefore properly to be considered as the god of the
                            sun. The death of Balder was  effected by the artifices of Lok, the
                            most malicious and baneful of the Gothic deities; Lok however 
                            dared not openly to destroy him with his own hand, but for this purpose
                            he presented a spear of  peculiar power to another of the sons of
                            Odin, Hoder, who with this enchanted weapon  unintentionally
                            pierced his brother to the heart. After this misfortune, the soul of
                            Balder, in conformity  to the tenets of the Gothic religion, was
                            supposed to descend to the dwelling of Hela, the goddess of  the
                            infernal realms. The grief in heaven on account of the death of Balder
                            was extreme; Frea, the  goddess of beauty, was peculiarly afflicted
                            by the loss of her lover, and resolved to undertake a journey  to
                            the regions of death, in hopes of obtaining by her entreaties the
                            release of Balder. This descent of  Frea, and the success which
                            attended it, are the subjects of the following Masque.</p>
