                <p rend="noCount">Bonaparte has one benefit more to confer upon the Spaniards â€” to put both their
                    King &amp; their Prince out of the way, â€” which I doubt not he will do. His work
                    of destruction is not quite completed, I hoped &amp; expected to have seen him
                    destroy the House of Austria &amp; the Turkish Empire. two great evils which
                    cumber the earth. He may perhaps turn upon these as an excuse for leaving Spain
                    alone, â€” but in Spain the fire has <del>broken</del> burst out which will
                    consume. â€” Well done my friend William Bryan the Prophet, you certainly did
                    prophecy to me in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Stephen Court concerning Spain, as
                    truly as <del>Moore</del> Francis Moore did in his Almanach last year concerning
                    the Grand Turk.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editor">Francis Moore

                <p rend="noCount">But there is another class to whom it is pernicious:â€”these are they who having
                    read without knowledge think themselves qualified to explain difficult texts,
                    &amp; meddle with the edged tools of theological controversy. One man reading
                    that my father is greater than I becomes without farther consideration an Arian.
                    The phrase Son of Man makes another a Socinian, a third extracts Calvinism out
                    of St Paul. There is a sect called the Jumpers who run out of their conventicle
                    into the streets shouting out Glory be to God in their own language, &amp;
                    jumping the while with incessant vehemenceâ€”till their strength is literally
                    exhausted. If you ask the reason of their frantic devotion they can give you xxx
                    for it, the blind man whom Peter &amp; John healed leaped &amp; praised God,
                    &amp; David danced before the Ark! These fanatics are confined to Wales, where
                    the people are half savages.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editor">A practice
                        among some Calvinistic Methodists in Caernarvon, North Wales, beginning in
                        the 1740s, and spreading through Cardiganshire, persisting into the early
                        nineteenth century.</note></p>
                <p rend="noCount">Many of the higher class as you may suppose live so entirely
                    without God in the world, that to them it would be of no consequence if the
                    Scripture <del>xxx</del> was in no other language than the original Hebrew. But
                    in all ranks of society there are numbers of persons to whom the perusal of Gods
                    own word is an inestimable comfort, in sickness &amp; in old age, in resignation
                    under sorrow or in thankfulness for <del>xxx</del> the blessing vouchsafed. the
                    Bible is to them in stead of beads or massesâ€”they go it [sic] with humble hearts
                    &amp; perfect faith, &amp; fervently feel all that they understand, &amp;
                    devoutly believe all which is above their comprehension. Father Antonio these
                    persons are schismatic because they are born so. it is their misfortuneâ€”not
                    their crime--&amp; I hope I may be permitted to hope that in this case the sins
                    of the fathers may not be visited upon the children.</p>

                    according to the decree of the Council of the Trent, no person were permitted to
                    have it in his possession without the permission of his Priest. It might also
                    have the useful effect of supplanting some of the books of devotion which savour
                    too much of credulity, &amp; do little honour to religion. But in saying this I

                <p rend="noCount"> The English Bible is regarded as one of the most beautiful
                    specimens of the language, &amp; the book which has fixed it. In order to
                    preserve the text correct the privilege of printing it is restricted to the two
                    universities, yet some impressions once got abroad wherein the negation in the
                        7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> commandment had been omitted, &amp; it was said Thou
                    shalt commit adultery. <del>Booksellers</del> There have &lt;been&gt; devised
                        <del>a</del> means of eluding this exclusive privilege by printing a
                    commentary with the text, &amp; in two magnificent Biblesâ€”the price of the one
                    being about 30 pieces of eight! this was so openly practised as a mere evasion,
                    that the commentary consisted in a single line in every sheet, printed in the
                    smallest type, &amp; so <del>near</del> &lt;close to&gt; the bottom of the page
                    that it could be pared off in binding. These books it may be supposed are truly
                    magnificent &amp; honourable to the state of arts in the country, but there are
                    a set of booksellers in <del>xxx xxx</del> whose main business consists in
                    printing worthless &amp; catchpenny publications for the ignorant in the
                    country, &amp; they have always a great Family Bible as they call it in course
                    of publication, ornamented with faithful engravings &amp; published periodically
                    because most of the deluded people who purchase it could not pay for it in any
                    other manner. The cover of one of their number was wrapt round some trifling
                    article which I bought the other day at a stationers,â€”it professed to render the
                    most difficult passages clear &amp; familiar, to rectify mistranslations,
                    reconcile the doubtful, confound the infidel, establish the peace &amp;
                    happiness of Christian families in this world, &amp; secure their eternal salvation

                    are emblematical of such delusionsâ€”not the golden goblet &amp; the bewitching

                    so heartily despised for their superstitionsâ€”in England where the people think

                    unlimited toleration which the law allows, the contemptuous indifference of the
                    clergy to all opinions &lt;any blasphemy&gt; which does not immediately threaten
