					<item>This file is a modification of the original 'gipsy_ms' file. The change
						consists of the removal of the songs from the file, and the insertion of
							<gi>anchor</gi> elements in their stead. The songs are encoded, using
						parallel segmentation, in a new file entitled 'gipsy_ms_songs.' The dramatis
						personae list has also been moved to the 'songs' file, simply because it
						needs to encoded using parallel segmentation as well--an anchor is also
						provided for this.</item>
