<p rend="indent2"> I have stolen time to write to you tho uncertain whether you may
                    still be at Plymouth: but if the letter should have to follow you, well
                    &amp; good, if lost — little matter. I have a Booksellers job on my hands:
                    it is to translate a volume from the French<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey translated the second volume of <title level="m">On
                            the French Revolution. By M. Necker</title> (1797).</note> — about a
                    months work, &amp; the pay will be not less than five &amp; twenty
                    guineas. an employment more profitable than pleasant, but I should like plenty
                    such. three or four such jobs would furnish me a house. — I wonder you could
                    think I did not say enough in favour of Miles.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">A friend of the Bedford family who lived at Vanbrugh Fields,
                        Greenwich. His first name is not recorded.</note> he is a man who
                    exceedingly pleased me — he has good sense, accomplishments &amp; that
                    openness of character which is worth every thing else — your description of the
                    Spanish Coast about S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Sebastians has very highly delighted
                    me. I intend to versify it — put the lines in Madoc, &amp; give your account
                    below in the note. to me who had never seen any other but the tame shores of
                    this island, the giant rocks of Galicia appeared stupendously sublime. they even
                    &lt;derived&gt; a grandeur from their barrenness — it gives them <del rend="strikethrough">th</del> a majestic simplicity that fills the
                    undistracted mind. I have in contemplation an<del rend="strikethrough">x
                        newxx</del>other work upon my journey. a series of Poems, the subjects
                    occasioned by the scenes I past, &amp; the meditations which those scenes
                    excited. do you perceive the range this plan includes? history — imagination —
                    philosophy — all could be pressed into my service, &amp; the poems would
                    equally include landscape painting &amp; sedition. <note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">This plan did not materialise.</note> a noble design —
                    &amp; it has met with some encouragement — but Time is scarce — &amp; I
                    must be a Lawyer — a sort of animal that might be made out of worse materials
                    than those with which Nature tempered my clay.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I suppose <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my
                        Mother</ref> has given you the history of <ref target="people.html#HillMargaret">Margerys</ref> correspondence with Major
                        Hill.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The older half-brother of
                        Herbert Hill. Southey gives a detailed account of him, and of their meeting
                        in 1797, in a letter to John May, 24 November 1805.</note> in consequence I
                    called upon him at his lodgings in town — he was very civil, &amp; I
                    breakfasted with him afterwards. he told me he should be glad to see me at
                    Chatham — but I fancy the family connection between him &amp; me will never
                    extend beyond a morning visit. he gave me however — the only good cup of coffee
                    I have tasted since I left Portugal. the old Major is a Connoisseur in Coffee.
                    in old times, he invented a machine for roasting it, but as now a free-born
                    Englishman is prohibited from roasting Coffee in this Land of liberty, he is
                    obliged to content himself with the best he can buy, &amp; he always buys it
                    himself.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I have a letter from Bath this evening, from <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</ref> thro <ref target="people.html#HillMargaret">Margery</ref> her amanuensis. it tells me
                    she is determined on quitting her house in September — &amp; that she must
                    live with<ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth"> my Aunt</ref> — as <ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</ref> is subject to bowel
                    complaints that render her health very uncertain. how all this is to be I know
                    not — for <ref target="people.html#HillMargaret">Margerys</ref> letter contains
                    only the determination. I wish I had a house. — &amp; it is only the want of
                    furniture that keeps me in lodgings.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I used to pass <ref target="people.html#SoutheyThomas">T.
                        Southey</ref> in the streets of Bristol sometimes; he is very much broken,

                    eminence in the law &amp; so become opulent before his death he would leave
                    me the bulk of his fortune no doubt, — because I was in a situation — not to
