<salute>My dear Sir</salute>

<p rend="indent1"> Time has justified all your prophecies with regard to my French
                    friends — the Sans Culottes the Jacobines &amp; the Fishwomen carry every
                    thing before them — every thing that is respectable every barrier that is sacred
                    is swept away by the ungovernable torrent — the people have changed tyrants
                    &amp; for the mild irresolute Louis bow to the savage the unrelenting
                        Pethion.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The ‘September massacres’
                        saw the killing of 1200 prisoners in the Paris gaols by the Parisian
                        revolutionaries. Jerome Petion de Villeneuve (1756–1794) was a Jacobin and
                        mayor of Paris at the time of the storming of the Tuileries on 20 June 1792.
                        In August of the same year, he headed a delegation demanding that Louis XVI
                        (1754–1793; reigned 1774–1792) be removed from the throne.</note> after so
                    open a declaration of abhorrence you may perhaps expect that all the sanguine
                    dreams of romantic liberty are gone for ever — it is true I have seen the
                    difficulty of saying to the mob thus far — no farther — I have seen a structure
                    reard by the hand of wisdom &amp; defended by the sword of liberty
                    undermined by innovation hurled from its basis by faction &amp; insulted by
                    the proud abuse of despotism — is it less respectable for its misfortunes? these
                    horrid barbarities however have rendered me totally indifferent to the fate of
                    France &amp; I have only to hope that Fayette<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Marie-Paul-Joseph-Roch-Gilbert Motier, Marquis de LaFayette
                        (1757–1834), French general and politician. Declared an enemy of the state
                        in August 1792, he escaped over the border and was imprisoned first by the
                        Prussians and then the Austrians. He was released in 1797.</note> will be
                    safe — <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> applies to him

                            fellow citizens, or by the threats of an imperious tyrant’, Horace (65–8

<p>before I quit the French let one remark that that very National Assembly which
                    you have stigmatised as a rabble of pettifogging attorneys &amp; illiterate
                    barbarians has furnished men who had the courage to preserve their duty at the
                    expence of their lives</p>
<p rend="indent1"> And now to descend from Liberty &amp; a Republic to myself —
                    I have been negligent very negligent not only in delaying to answer your kind
                    letter but in letting <ref target="people.html#LambThomasDavis">Toms</ref> last
                    remain so long unnoticed that I know not where to direct to him — my last met
                    him at Glasgow &amp; from thence I received a very long account from him of
                    all he had seen which at once amused &amp; instructed me — I am too apt to
                    commit faults in haste &amp; repent at leisure but how this lazy fit came on
                    I know not — Procrastination is the thief of time<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Young (1683–1765; <title level="m">DNB</title>),

                    am to set off for Oxford which will certainly be in the course of a fortnight.
                    there I have four years &amp; a half to spend poring over Euclid<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Euclid of Alexandria (dates uncertain, between
                        325 and 250 BC), mathematician. His work includes the <title level="m">Elements</title>.</note> &amp; the fathers &amp; in laying out
                    plans for the future which probably will never be put in execution — since <ref target="people.html#LambThomasDavis">Tom</ref> has given up all thoughts of
                    the university for a method of education in my opinion far[MS torn] Oxford has

<p rend="indent1"> I have been attempting Euclid but without a master I could make
                    no progress — perhaps disgust at the dry study contributed but I did not want
                    perseverance — my brain was so confused with parallels horizontals triangles
                    parallellograms &amp; all the jargon of mathematical precision that after a
                    fortnights hard study I fairly laid it on the shelf &amp; took up my

<p rend="indent1"> I have now to beg forgiveness for my neglect &amp; that you
                    will inform me (as I really intend to make amends by writing him a very long
