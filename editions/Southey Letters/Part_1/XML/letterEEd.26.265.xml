<p rend="indent1">	Can you tell me what were the arms of Salisbury &amp; Talbot? they may be alluded to with good effect. <del rend="strikethrough">Of Hungerford</del> I accidentally found a singular circumstance connected with Hungerford. I rambled to Farley Castle, once the seat of that family, now a pile of ruins — small &amp; trifling but well situated. the chapel is still roofed, &amp; in a vault beneath lie five of the Hungerfords in pickle, in leaden cases bearing much such a rude resemblance to the human form as the mummy outsides a small leaden box contains their entrails. a hole has been bored by the shoulder of one, &amp; in probing with a stick the bone <del rend="strikethrough">xxx</del> the shoulder may distinctly be felt, &amp; the leathery fleshliness of the neck.</p>
<p rend="indent1">	I have had no Coke<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Coke (1552–1643; <title level="m">DNB</title>), <title level="m">Commentarie upon Littleton</title> (1628), the first part of his four part <title level="m">Institutes of the Laws of England</title> (1628–1644).</note> yet. <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> has a mischievous habit of delaying what he has to do. to instance in trifles — he has never yet given me a Musæus.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Grosvenor Charles Bedford’s translation of Musæus (fl. c. early 6th century), <title level="m">The Loves of Hero and Leander</title> (1797).</note>
</p>
<p rend="indent1">	I have now omitted every thing miraculous, &amp; given the historical account of the Maids first appearance. the burning of the Herald also is done. what remains to do is trifling — little alterations of lines &amp; words, &amp; a few insertions to mark the costume.</p>
<p rend="indent1">	Madame Elizabeth<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Élisabeth Philippine Marie Hélène of France (1764–1794), sister of Louis XVI (1754–1793; reigned 1774–1792), was executed in May 1794.</note> cannot be connected with the names of Brissot &amp; Rolands wife<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The leading Girondists, Jacques Pierre Brissot (1754–1793), who was executed in October 1793, and Marie-Jeanne Roland de la Platiere (1754–1793), who was executed in November 1793.</note> on account of the sentiments which associate with them. if a place can fitly be found I will willingly make mention of her — <del rend="strikethrough">so as to</del> but I must be careful not to be considered as confounding revolutionary excesses with revolutionary opinions.</p>
<p rend="indent1">	I have procured an old translation of De Serres.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Jean De Serres (1540–1598), <title level="m">Histoire de France</title> (1598). Southey used the English translation by Edward Grimestone (dates unknown), published in 1607, for the second edition of <title level="m">Joan of Arc</title> (1798).</note> but I am told the best account of the Maid is in the Histoire de l’Eglise Gallican par Berthier,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Guillaume-François Berthier (1704–1782), <title level="m">Histoire de l’Eglise Gallican</title> (1745–1749).</note> a book I have sought for in vain. in Weys book from Le Grand<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Gregory Lewis Way’s (1757–1799) translation of <title level="m">Fabliaux or Tales, Abridged from French Manuscripts of the XIIth and XIIIth Centuries by M. Le Grand, Selected and Translated into English Verse</title> (London, 1796), especially p. 232.</note> there is a note from the Journal of Paris at that period, relating to her, which furnished me with subject for some of my best lines — they relate to a place she frequented in Lorraine called the Fountain of the Fairies. do you know either of these books?</p>
<p rend="indent1">	I mean to consult Burneys History of Music<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Burney (1726–1814; <title level="m">DNB</title>), <title level="m">A General History of Music</title> (1776–89).</note> for the instrument of the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century. in Chaucer I for ever find the ribible<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">The ribible is a three-stringed viol, often mentioned in the works of Geoffrey Chaucer (c. 1340–1400; <title level="m">DNB</title>); see for example, <title level="m">The Miller’s Tale</title>.</note> — but nothing else &amp; no explanation of that. now tho I have used one word which nobody understands. the <hi rend="ital">jazerent</hi> of double mail — I shall not take the same liberty with another. jazerina often occurs in the Guerras Civiles de Granada.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Gines Perez de Hita (1544?–1619?), <title level="m">Guerras Civiles de Granada</title> (1595–1604).</note>
