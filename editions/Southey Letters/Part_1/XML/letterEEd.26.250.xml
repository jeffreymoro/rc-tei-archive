<salute>My dear friend</salute>
</opener>
<p rend="indent2">		After a journey of almost four hundred miles &amp; very great mental anxiety I am once more at rest, with the reward of believing that I have contributed to the happiness of two persons. I can not say that friendship put my exertions in requisition, for my acquaintance with <ref target="people.html#LloydCharles">Charles Lloyd</ref> (whom I accompanied) was slight. one day you shall hear the particulars in conversation — suffice it now to say that he came to me greatly agitated, &amp; uncertain how to act, that the happiness of <ref target="people.html#PembertonSophia">a very excellent young woman</ref> depended upon his conduct, that matters are well arranged — &amp; that he has returned with me to be my guest till in three months I transfer him to her who will then have the best claim.</p>
<p rend="indent1">	We reached this place last night. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</ref> will be here on Saturday night. I could much wish you to visit us while she is here. you would see a woman whose health Affliction has broken, but whose unalterable sweetness of temper nothing has been able to injure. you would see <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother</ref> likewise, who has left his ship. an excellent young man. we met unexpectedly at Bristol on my return. when he had procured his discharge the Lieutenants called him into their room, &amp; offered him collectively &amp; individually certificates that his conduct had been uniformly strictly proper &amp; that the Captain<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Robert Barlow (1757–1843; <title level="m">DNB</title>).</note> had been wholly &amp; solely to blame. Is it in your power to get him rated in some other vessel? he has served four years &amp; a half — &amp; is I believe an excellent sailour. one who knows his duty &amp; performs it is a valuable acquisition to any ship.</p>
<p rend="indent1">	You shall know <ref target="people.html#LambCharles">Lambs</ref> history when we meet. I shall relate it to you with the hope of perhaps benefiting a man, who amid sufferings more intense than usually afflict mankind, has attained a degree of saintly resignation almost more than human. I myself have little knowledge of him; <ref target="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</ref> sought him out &amp; has won his intimacy. he has certainly performed to the utmost every duty of every relation.</p>
<p rend="indent1">	We are situate about ¼ of a mile short of the 8 mile stone from Ringwood. the inn at Christ Church is nearly two miles distant. it is a decent one, &amp; as I have in some part explained how the room destined for your reception became pre-occupied, it were needless to apologize. I shall &lt;have&gt; much pleasure in introducing you to <ref target="people.html#LloydCharles">Charles Lloyd</ref>. men who mean well, &amp; wish to act well ought to know each other, &amp; as you say, if there be but a few Sodom may yet be saved. <note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">In <title level="m">Genesis</title> 18, God declared that the city of Sodom would be spared if it contained ten righteous men. It did not, and so was destroyed.</note> Of collective efforts, &amp; the elicited wisdom of conversation — I think as little as of the rest of the city-philosophers jargon. but good men encourage each other in goodness &amp; chear the path of life which is somewhat wearying to the best of us.</p>
<p rend="indent1">
<ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> derives his chief support from the contributions of his friends, &amp; thro the hands of <ref target="people.html#EstlinJohnPrior">Estlin</ref> of Bristol receives about fifty pounds annually. this as you may suppose can be but little for one who has neither the feelings nor habits of honest independance, &amp; who always indulges himself careless of consequences. some Linendraper is now going to live with him &amp; study one hour a day. ridiculous as this is, it is the most feasible plan he has yet adopted. the man cannot be very hungry after learning who limits himself to one hour a day, &amp; if instead of a tutor &amp; guide he can be satisfied with th[MS torn] most entertaining of — I may say — buffoons — they will do well together. it is not possible to think too highly[MS torn] <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridges</ref> abilities, or too despicably of him in every other character.</p>
<p rend="indent1">	Have you seen a poem addressed to me by Miss Anna Seward?<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Anna Seward (1747–1809; <title level="m">DNB</title>), ‘Written by Anna Seward, After Reading Southey’s <title level="m">Joan of Arc</title>’ appeared in the <title level="j">Morning Chronicle</title> on 5 August 1797.</note> if not I can much amuse you by it. she applies to my poetry what Milton says of the Pandæmonium chorists.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">John Milton (1608–1674; <title level="m">DNB</title>), <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title> (1667).</note> calls me an unnatural boy, a beardless parricide, &amp; dark of heart; says I cry like a crocodile &amp; bids me laugh like a hyena. — &amp; laugh I did most heartily — &amp; so I think will you at perusing this very delectable poem.</p>
<p rend="indent1">	When shall we see you? <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> desires to be remembered.</p>
