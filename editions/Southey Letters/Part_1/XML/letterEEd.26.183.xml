<p rend="indent1"> WHEN we read an imitation, we expect a beautiful poem, because
                    the imitator may add beauties of his own to those of the first author; but in a
                    translation, we ought to find a faithful copy of the original.</p>

<l rend="indent3">Nec verbum verbo curabis reddere, fidus</l>

                            (65–8 BC), <title level="m">Ars Poetica,</title> lines 133–134. The
                            Latin translates as ‘you will not trouble to render word for word like a
                            faithful translator’.</note>

<p>is an admirable text for a title-page; but surely it is the duty of the
                    translator to preserve the meaning of his original, while he adapts its idioms

<p rend="indent1"> Luis de Camoens<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Luis Vaz

                        (1776).</note> however, is not contented with this; he has defended his
                    faults, allegorized his absurdities, hid the thread-bare texture of the
                    Portuguese, with his own embroidery, and then raises him to a proud equality
                    with Homer, and Virgil, and Milton; but Camoens must not be lifted up so high,
                    neither must Homer, and Virgil, and Milton, be degraded into such company:
                    though Camoens may, perhaps. come the next to Tasso,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Torquato Tasso (1544–1595), author of <title level="m">Jerusalem delivered</title> (1580–1581).</note> he must be <hi rend="ital">proximus, sed longo intervallo!</hi>

                        line 320. The Latin translates as ‘second [to him] but second by a big
                        margin’.</note> For though in the choice of a subject, and the unity of
                    design, he may have the advantage over Lucan, and Statius, and Ariosto,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Marcus Annaeus Lucanus (AD 39–65), author
                        of the <title level="m">Pharsalia</title>; Publius Papinius Statius (AD
                        45–96), Roman epic poet; and Ludovico Ariosto (1474–1535), Italian epic
                        poet, author of <title level="m">Orlando Furioso</title>.</note> in the
                    execution of it he is lamentably inferior.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> The English reader will be surprised to hear, that the language
                    of the Lusiad is remarkably bald; but before I proceed to point out what
                    poetical beauties belong to Camoens, and what to Mr. Mickle, it will be proper
                    to give <hi rend="ital">the Portuguese review</hi> of the English version.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I use the Lisbon edition of 1782, edited by Thomas Joseph de
                        Aquino,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Joseph de Aquino
                        (dates unknown), <title level="m">Obras de Luis de Camoes</title>, 2nd edn,
                        5 vols (Lisbon, 1782). The preface included translations of large chunks of
                        Mickle’s introduction to his <title level="m">The Lusiad, or, The Discovery
                            of India</title> (1776). For de Aquino’s objections to Mickle see S.
                        George West, ‘The work of W. J. Mickle, the first Anglo-Portuguese scholar’,
                            <title level="m">Review of English Studies</title>, 40 (1934),
                        398.</note> and the second of his editions:</p>
<p rend="indent1"> “In my first edition,” says he, “I informed my readers of a new
                    and famous translation, published at London, by the celebrated poet, William
                    Julius Mickle. At that time I knew nothing more of the version, and contented
                    myself with thus slightly noticing it; now, however, I have the pleasure to give
                    the public a complete analysis of all that the celebrated translator has written
                    in his several dissertations and tracts upon the subject; for all this, I am
                    obliged to the most reverend father Michael Daly, a man, as all know, signally
                    accomplished in every kind of erudition, and more a Portuguese in his
                    affections, than many who are so by birth. I could enlarge in well deserved
                    encomiums upon this sage, did not my intimate knowledge of his modesty prevent
                    me. This, however, I will always publish with a grateful mind, that in the
                    general reformation of studies which took place in the reign of our lord the
                    king, Don Joseph the First; he it was who principally revived Greek literature,
                    which had been for so many years dead in Portugal; and he likewise it was, who,
                    with an ardent and indefatigable zeal for religion, laboured in the
                    re-establishment of the college, which the Irish have here, <hi rend="ital">for
                        the educating of missionaries, and the preservation of the Catholic religion
                        in Ireland</hi>.” He now gives in the words of Father Daly, an analysis of
                    all the tracts prefixed to the English Lusiad, with several extracts. “After
                    these preliminary disquisitions,” says he, “comes the translation of the poem,
                    which may be pronounced the most poetical that has yet appeared.” The
                    translation is accompanied with notes, historical and critical, in which he
                    displays great knowledge of the history of Portugal, and a sound critical
                    judgment.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> “Yet, though it be not our intention to criticise the English
                    translator, who has done so much honour and justice to Camoens, we ought not to
                    pass over in total silence, the various liberties which he has taken with the
                    original, some which he has confessed, and others which he has not confessed. Of
                    those which he has not confessed, we will give two examples, leaving it to
                    others to determine how far a translator is justified in so altering and
                    foisting interpolations on his text.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> “In the fiction of Adamastor, Camoens makes that giant relate his
                    history, and that of his amours, to Gama himself: the translator, however, takes
                    another way; for he makes the spectre disappear after breathing out prophetical
                    threats against the Portuguese, and the king of Melinda; then relates, that they
                    had among them this tradition, that in the war of the giants, one had fallen
                    upon their kingdom, whose groans were nightly heard; that by the incantations of
                    a holy man, the spectre had been obliged to declare who he was; and then the
                    history follows. The other place is in the beginning of the ninth book:—
                    According to Camoens, the Zamorim releases the Portuguese goods, which in the
                    8th book had been landed; and he simply relates in the ninth, that Gama,
                    impatient to depart for Europe, commands his factors to embark with their goods,
                    but he receives intelligence, that his factors are detained: Gama immediately
                    orders some merchants to be seized who had come on board his ship to sell
                    precious stones, and prepares to depart. The wives and children of the merchants
                    who are thus seized on board the ships, go to the Zamorim, and complain that
                    their husbands and fathers are lost. Moved by their cries, the Zamorim releases
                    the Portuguese factors, and restores the goods, and Gama departs from Calicut.
                    But the translator relates all this differently: according to his account, in
                    the ninth book, Gama is a prisoner at the court of the Zamorim, who in an
                    arrogant speech commands that commander to make his ships draw nearer to the
                    shore and to deliver up to him their sails. Gama refuses to consent, perceiving
                    the evil intentions of the Zamorim. Immediately he makes a signal for his fleet
                    to attack the Portuguese ships: a description of the engagement follows, and a
                    tempest arises which totally destroys the fleet of the Zamorim. The victorious
                    armada now draws nearer to the shore, and begins to thunder with its artillery
                    upon the city. The terrified populace clamour around the palace, and demand the
                    release of the factors; and their prince, alarmed by the destruction of his
                    fleet, the insurrection of his people, and the intrepidity of the Portuguese,
                    releases Gama, and permits him to embark. This account occupies more than three
                    hundred lines, to which not one corresponding line is to be found in the
                    original.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> “I point out only these two instances, for the sake of brevity;
                    but the reader who is versed in the English language, as well as in the

                    passages that are in the original, or inserted passages that are not.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> “Mr. Mickle has, indeed, in his preliminary Dissertation,
                    confessed, in general terms, that his intention was to give an English Lusiad in
                    a free poetical spirit; and he says truly enough, that a “literal translation of
                    poetry is in reality a solecism. You may construe your author, indeed; but if
                    with some translators you boast that you have left your author to speak for
                    himself, that you have neither added nor diminished, you have, in reality,
                    grossly abused him, and deceived yourself. Your literal translation can have no
                    claim to the original felicities of expression, the energy, elegance, and fire
                    of the original poetry. It may, indeed, bear a resemblance, but such a one as a
                    corpse in the sepulchre bears to the former man when he moved in the bloom and
                    vigour of life.</p>

<p>was the taste of the Augustan age. None but a poet can translate a poet. The
                    freedom which this precept gives, will, therefore, in a poet’s hands, not only
                    infuse the energy, elegance, and fire of his author’s poetry into his own
                    version, but will give it also the spirit of an original.”</p>
<p rend="indent1"> “But notwithstanding this, a translation ought to be a faithful
                    representation of the original, which it may be, without rendering word by word,
                    as is evidently proved by the various versions of Homer and Virgil in the
                    European languages, and particularly in the English. They preserve the spirit of
                    the original, without suppressing or interpolating entire passages. Nor can the
                    translator avail himself of the authority of Horace; for it clearly appears from
                    the context, that this precept is entirely for <hi rend="ital">imitators</hi>,
                    and not for translators; and certainly there is a wide difference between an
                    imitation and a translation. A translation, in which such great liberties are
                    taken, may very easily deceive the reader. — Let us suppose, for instance, that
                    some future Voltaire, without knowing the Portuguese language, should wish to
                    form some idea of the poem of Camoens, by means of Mr. Mickle’s version: if he
                    should imagine that the description of the battle and tempest in the ninth book,
                    is in a very inflated style, and abounds with false sublime, he would naturally
                    attribute all these faults to the original, notwithstanding not a trace of this
                    description is to be discovered there. Thus would he be deceived, as Voltaire
                    himself was, by imputing to Camoens the absurdities of Fanshaw.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Voltaire, François-Marie Arouet (1694–1778),

                        (1727). However, his critique of <title level="m">The Lusiad</title> was
                        based purely on his reading of the 1655 translation by Sir Robert Fanshawe

                    of Camoens, and the language and history of Portugal; and we have given him some
                    idea of the labour he has taken to compile so many illustrations of his author,

<p rend="indent1"> “After allowing this, we must not pass over some gross errors of
                    Mr. Mickle, though it is with reluctance that we remark them. In many places he
                    treats the Portuguese nation with great incivility, and particularly in a note
                    to the life of Camoens, where he inveighs against our lord cardinal king Henry,
                    for the punishment which he justly inflicted upon the Scotch Buchanan,<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">The Scottish humanist George Buchanan

                        the future King Henry I of Portugal (1512–1580; reigned 1578–1580); see
                            <title level="m">The Lusiad, or, The Discovery of India</title> (Oxford,

                    Portuguese nation, and very unworthy as well of the gentleman as of the
                    philosopher; for, in the nature of things, the character which he gives of the
                    Portuguese cannot possible be true of any civilzed people.</p>

                    has taken care to show his hatred and aversion for the Catholic faith. He
                    repeats over and over again, the old and almost forgotten calumnies of idolatry,
                    and other similar charges which have been so completely refuted a thousand and a
                    thousand times, and of which now all sensible Protestants are themselves
                    ashamed. He falsifies facts and makes ridiculous and absurd allusions, which
                    prove nothing except the malignity of the author. This he does, no doubt, to
                    accommodate his book to the taste of his countrymen, and increase its
