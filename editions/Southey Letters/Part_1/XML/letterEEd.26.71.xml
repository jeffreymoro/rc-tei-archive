<p rend="indent1"> Your silence my dear <ref target="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</ref> rather alarmed than
                    surprized me, I concluded you were unhappy &amp; that rather than
                    communicate any disagreable intelligence you were silent. daily expectation
                    prevented me from writing. it is not an hour since I received yours. but the
                    weight of solitary reflection must be thrown off. learn the whole history of my
                    situation &amp; when you &lt;know&gt; what Philosophy has done for
                    me — try my friend the same remedy.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> you know <ref target="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">my
                        father</ref> was a tradesman. in those circumstances which enabled him for
                    twenty years to live happily &amp; support a family in that honourable
                    mediocrity most to be envied. three years back he became the dupe of artifice
                    &amp; was ruined. he struggled in vain with misfortunes. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyJohn">an unfeeling brother</ref> refused
                    assistance — &amp; he was arrested not for his own debts but for a bill
                    endorsed for a deceitful friend. I saw <ref target="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">him</ref> Horace in prison. I saw him
                    releasd just in time to reach home — meet fresh misfortunes &amp; die of a
                    broken heart. mine <del rend="strikethrough">hav</del> must either have broken
                    or grown callous. for what I am reservd I know not. few calamities can now
                    afflict me for to these most dreadful ones my own imprudence has added others. I
                    contracted a debt for books when a false kindness conceald the misfortunes of
                        <ref target="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">my father</ref>. home you may
                    easily imagine could be no longer agreable. I had always lived with <ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</ref>. she is the best of women.
                    but unmerited injuries — &amp; generosity (even prodigal) ill requited have
                    soured her temper. the lodging house which <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</ref> supports herself by at
                    Bath, is still more unpleasant I am compelld to associate with fools &amp;
                    to know they think it condescension.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> When <ref target="people.html#SewardEdmund">Edmund Seward</ref>
                    invited me to Sapey I gladly went. his character commanded esteem. I saw Augusta
                        Roberts<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">A friend of the Seward
                        family.</note> — six days I lived in the same house — scarcely ever from her
                    sight. the snow confined us. I was lost. when I wishd her farewell my heart was
                    full &amp; she was not unmoved. I brooded over an attachment which appeard
                    innocent — I indulged dreams of future fortune. communications with <ref target="people.html#Sewardfamily">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Seward</ref>,
                    rendered it easy to keep up my memory but I was dissatisfied. I wrote to
                    Augusta. the lines were inclosed for <ref target="people.html#SewardEdmund">Edmund Sewards</ref> perusal. he wrote immediately in the utmost agitation
                    &amp; acquainted me with his brother<del rend="strikethrough">s</del>
<ref target="people.html#Sewardfamily">Johns</ref> attachment to Augusta. he
                    describd his own situation &amp; with a generosity seldom equalld in Romance
                    waited my reply declaring he would not interest himself for his brother. what
                    remaind for me? at the expence of my happiness I preservd that of two persons
                    more deserving. I directed him to burn my letter. desird him to forget it
                    &amp; promised what never can be performd to forget Augusta.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> this last happened whilst I was at <ref target="places.html#Brixton">Brixton</ref>. compare your situation with mine
                        <ref target="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</ref>.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> there was a period when I had almost abandond hope &amp;
                    resolvd to seek happiness in another world. at another time I have thought of
                    selling myself to murder in the East Indies &amp; relieve my family from a
                    burden. but they look to me for future support. the church is allotted for my
                    pursuit &amp; when I reflect how unfit I am for the office — this appears
                    the heaviest of my misfortunes. unfortunately my dear friend I am not stupid
                    enough to be orthodox. doubts will intrude. I cannot stifle them I cannot find
                    conviction &amp; an oath &lt;is&gt; required at ordination — add to
                    this that in my ideas the very existence of a priest is wrong. to obtain future
                    support — to return the benefits I have received, I must become contemptible
                    infamous &amp; perjured.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> on this most gloomy prospect one only ray of light appears. at
                    the deaths of <ref cRef="people.html#SoutheyJohn">my fathers elder brother</ref>
                    &amp; <del rend="strikethrough">that</del> of Lord Somerville<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">James Somerville, 14th Lord Somerville
                        (1727–1796).</note> a very large estate reverts to me. but even of this I
                    can obtain no more information. enquiry is vain. I would sell the reversion did
                    I know particulars — but the whole is enveloped in mystery. a man appearingly
                    from the country when first my father became bankrupt called &amp; offerd to
                    buy it. the offer was made with insolence &amp; my fathers feelings overcame
                    his judgement. ‘tho I have ruined myself I never will ruin my children’ said he,
                    &amp; turnd the man out of doors without enquiring who employed him.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> my eccentricities can no longer surprize. at the age of nineteen
                    I have known more calamity than many who deserve it more, meet with in long
                    lives. the only society that could please me here is that of some young women
                        sisters<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
<ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> and <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">Sarah Fricker</ref>.</note> — with
                    whom I was partly educated &amp; whose histories are as melancholy as my
                    own. the ill grounded fears of <ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my
                        Aunt</ref> forbid it. I see them seldom. but they know my motives &amp;
                    pity me. other society I have none. this city is peopled with rich fools — I
                    might mingle with them but I cannot bow &amp; smile where I despise folly
                    &amp; execrate vice. thus am I compelld to seek internal resources. I have
                    read libraries &amp; written volumes, &amp; still find I have libraries
                    to read &amp; volumes to write. it is not for fame — it is for a temporary
                    refuge I seek.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I have written without reserve. never before did I totally
                    unbosom myself. judge if I can be happy. how hard must be this heart that is yet
                    whole!</p>
<p rend="indent1"> let me turn to you. never were two young men more calculated for
                    happiness or farther from it. your situation is however preferable to mine —
                    will you be surpassed in resolution? call up the latent energy of mind. seek
                    refuge in study — &amp; remember no crime can equal despair. whilst life can
                    be of service to one existing being it is criminal to quit it. what but this
                    witholds me either from seeking happiness in France in America or in the grave?
                    but my family look forwards to my assistance — my brothers<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
<ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henry Herbert Southey</ref> and <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward Southey</ref>.</note> (two of them) will have no other support.
                    poor <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Thomas</ref> is even more wretched
                    than me. he is serving for pay in a cause he knows to be unjust! I attempt to
                    blind his reason but it is too strong for delusion. he now affects a happiness
                    which I know he does not feel.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> yet <ref target="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</ref> I
                    live. I make pursuits — draw out the most extensive plans &amp; pursue them
                    with resolution. my heart partakes of my friends happiness &amp; has a pang
                    in store for his affliction. I rise &lt;in&gt; the morning without
                    expecting pleasure &amp; lie down without wishing dissolution. my mind is
                    fortified by philosophy. the conflict was severe but passion yielded. &amp;
                    at this period the least part of my misery or of my happiness is selfish. I feel
                    more for my friends. below the malice of Fortune I feel myself above her
                    influence. she now can have but few afflictions in store. her quiver must be
                    almost exhausted. &amp; whatever she can inflict I can sustain.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I could draw the comparison between our situations &amp;
                    point out how preferable is yours. consider them yourself. you have the
                    affection of a deserving object. nothing but her becoming worthless can deprive
                    you of it. I forbear to enlarge but you think me wrong. suffer me to say thus
                    much — she must be unworthy of you if any earthly power can make her false.
                    force can always be opposed. &amp; remember in the most hazardous attempt
                    you are sure of one associate.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> excuse this. the subject is delicate &amp; I have said
                    perhaps too much. </p>
<p>let me turn to more chearful subjects. your verses were particularly good —
                    &amp; they have the additional merit of novelty in manner &amp; metre.
                    write more. fame is a very late consideration — but let us remember that Pope
                    acquired independance by his Homer.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Alexander Pope (1688–1744; <title level="m">DNB</title>) made himself
                        financially secure with his translations of <title level="m">The
                            Iliad</title> (1715–1720) and <title level="m">The Odyssey</title>
                        (1725–1726).</note> let me say <ref target="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</ref> that Popes abilities
                    were not above comparison. undertake some great work. it will take up your
                    attention certainly — you certainly have abilities for any work. chuse either
                    epic or a metrical romance. &amp; in the intervals exercise yourself in the
                    lower ranks for with us lyrics are very subordinate.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> study will not so effectuately please as composition. they do
                    best mingled without order. I speak for myself. what I have written you know.
                    more than any author ever did at my age — in a very few years I shall out volume
                    Lope de Vega<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Carpio Lope Felix de Vega
                        (1562–1635), prolific Spanish dramatist and poet.</note> if that were
                    praise. I begin to wish publication. write &amp; publish with me. we deserve
                    success. posterity may pity our fortunes but rejoice in their consequences.
                    write as soon as you can &amp; in verse tho this be not. tomorrow I visit
                        <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</ref> &amp; shall
                    take my letter book for you. you shall have a long epistle — but write before it
                    arrives. on Sunday I return.</p>
