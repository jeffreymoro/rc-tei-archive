<ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> you may conceive the luxury of that ejaculation if you know the miseries of a sea-voyage. even the <del rend="strikethrough">xxxxx</del> stone who loves nothing &amp; the merchant whose trade-tainted heart loves nothing but wealth, would echo it. judge you with what delight Robert Southey leapt on terra firma.</p>
<p rend="indent1">	to night I go to Southampton. tomorrow will past pains become pleasant.</p>
<p rend="indent1">	Now <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</ref> is Happiness a Sojourner on Earth? or must Man be cat &amp; ninetaild by Care till he shields himself in a shroud? — my future destiny will not decide the problem. for I find a thousand pleasures &amp; a thousands pains <del rend="strikethrough">than</del> &lt;of which&gt; nine tenths of the world know nothing <del rend="strikethrough">of</del>. </p>
<p rend="indent1">	to your long letter I shall elaborately reply in verse. you need not read it if you think I am “urging you to a precipice.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably a quotation from Bedford’s own letter (which does not survive).</note>
<ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> — better is the tempest of passion — than that unwholesome calm that generates pestilence.</p>
<p rend="indent1">	Come to Bristol. be with me there as long as you can. I almost add — advise me there — but your advice will come too late.</p>
<p rend="indent1">	I am sorry you could ask if you did wrong in showing <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> my letter. I have not a thought secret from him. <del rend="strikethrough">even you know not her good sense yet</del>

<p rend="indent1">	my passage was very good. &amp; I must be the best tempered fellow in Great Britain for the devil a drop of gall is there in my bile-bag.</p>
<p rend="indent1">	I intend a hymn to the Dii Penates. <note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The Roman gods of household and hearth. The ‘Hymn to the Penates’ appeared in Southey’s <title level="m">Poems</title> (1797).</note>

<p rend="indent1">	Lord Somerville<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">James Somerville, 14th Lord Somerville (1727–1796), a very distant relation of Southey’s by marriage. Southey hoped to inherit a share of the fortune of John Cannon Southey on the death of Somerville, but his hopes came to nothing.</note> is dead — no matter to me I believe. for the estates were chiefly copy hold — &amp; Canon Southey minded wine &amp; women too much to think of renewing for the sake of his heirs.</p>
<p rend="indent1">	remember me to all friends — &amp; “to all your good family.”<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">A salutation that Southey commonly used in letters to the Bedfords and to Charles Collins – so much so, that it became an in-joke.</note>
