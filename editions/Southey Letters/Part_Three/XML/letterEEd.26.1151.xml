                    have in consequence altered my opinion of its author. You will wonder at this; yet if it were not for the too frequent good luck
                    he had of picking up fish &amp; fowl I should very readily acquit him of any thing more than common Methodist trade roguery. It is
                    very practicable for a preacher to live by Faith if he can but convince his congregation of it. The book will <del>xxx</del>
                    supply me with a good letter, it is a very curious production, &amp; certainly has merit of its own. Did I tell you that when last

                    man; who instead of straining himself by speaking loud, enforces what he has to say more easily by a significant nod of the head.
                    His congregation had quite a physiognomy of their own: sallow, dismal people, – looking as if they were already so near the fire
                    &amp; brimstone that it had coloured their complections. I mean to go to all the curious meeting houses in London when next there

                        disadvantaging Catholics and Protestant dissenters. These ensured that public offices were only tenable by those prepared to
                        submit to tests of their conformity to the Anglican church establishment. These laws were not repealed by the new ministry
                        owing to the opposition of the king; repeal was delayed until 1828 and 1829. The Reform Act extending the franchise passed in
