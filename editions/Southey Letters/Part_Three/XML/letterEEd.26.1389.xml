                        instigation, appeared an extract from <title>Letters from England</title>, Letter 38, concerning the exploitation of the poor
                        in the new commercial and manufacturing towns. On 17 November an extract from Letter 36 criticising Birmingham had been
                        published. An advertisement for the book appeared on 1 December.

                    to compleat the object of the book. As for the Specimens I am perfectly satisfied that it will be very easy to metamorphose them
                    into a good book, if ever there should be a second edition – &amp; equally convinced that this opportunity will never be

                    which a foul edition was unavoidable, – but certes it needed not to have been quite so foul as it is. I have seen only one
                    reviewal of it which was in the Universal Magazine some months ago, &amp; there the author contrived to invalidate all the censure
