                    sworn positively to the men, the fact of the gun would have convicted one of them. Even now a person accustomed to the art of
                    cross-examining might sift the matter out. I do not however think Frederick is in any farther danger, – marked as the wretches are

                    days ago, having painted for me the best whole length miniature I ever saw of your <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">god

                    &amp; is indeed a very nice picture. With me she has not succeeded quite so well, – there is something like melancholy in the cast
                    of countenance, which does not belong to me. But Senhora<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey’s nickname for Barker

                    gone with her to London to be framed. Yes yes Senhora, other people will do pictures for this study of mine, – &amp; my walls will
                    not be naked notwithstanding your abominations.</p><p rend="indent1"> I have been thinking it is not unlikely you have heard of our goings on from the Wolseleys<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Reverend Robert Wolseley (d. 1815), son of William Wolseley, 6th Baronet (1740–1817) was a fellow pupil of Southey’s at Westminster School. He and his wife (first name and dates unknown) visited Keswick several times in 1808 and 1809. Their family seat was at Wolseley Park, Rugeley, Staffordshire.</note> now that they are
                    returned into Staffordshire, for if they see <ref target="people.html#LittletonEdwardJohn">Sir Edward</ref> their talk will be
                    about us. She is a thoroughly good natured woman, – we liked her well, &amp; were so used to her that we were all sorry when she
                    went away.</p><p rend="indent1"> My lease is executed,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey signed a twenty-one year lease to rent Greta
                        Hall.</note> – this you will be glad to hear. Poor <ref target="people.html#JacksonWilliam">Jackson</ref> is still alive, –
                    that is all I can say, – &amp; I hope he may not be so when this reaches you. I have secured his part of the house, – &amp; have a

                    for she is old enough to have words put into her head, – &amp; mere words acquired now will be knowledge hereafter. She is a fine
                    girl – taller now than <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Sara</ref>, – I am sure you would be well pleased with
                    her, <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">My son</ref> too, tho not upon so large a scale, &amp; I fear not quite so thriving,
                    would delight you. As for <ref target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref> she is yet too young to be talked about, – but
                    doubtless if she lives I shall soon begin to love her a little more than is perfectly right.</p><p rend="indent1"> As for my goings on you know their usual course, – working is with me as regular &amp; as necessary a part of life
                    as eating, &amp; one day differs from another only the nature of the work &amp; of the dinner. The Annual Review is dead. I write
                    a little for the Quarterly at much better wages; so that change is for the better. Fifty four sheets of my history are printed

                    good pay but such late notice that I shall be inconveniently pinched (as we say in Cumberland) for time.</p><p rend="indent1"> When we shall see you here Heavens knows; for I do not think Sir Edward will ever find his way to the Lakes. <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref> would have been with me at this time, had it not been for the sudden death of
                    his father, his coming now is very uncertain. I hear that <ref target="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppa</ref> is in Northumberland,
                    therefore think it likely he will take this place on his way back – At least I shall press him so to do. <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> goes on intermitting with the Friend.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Friend</title> was a periodical written by Coleridge in 1809 and 1810, spanning twenty-eight issues and ending in
