                        Elizabeth Smith (1776–1806; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Fragments in Prose and Verse: by a young lady lately deceased
                            (Elizabeth S- ). With some account of her life and character, by the author of ‘Sermons on the Doctrine and Duties of
                            Christianity’</title> [Henrietta Maria Bowdler] (1808). Smith had been, from 1801, a resident of Coniston in the Lake
                        District with her parents. Smith was an accomplished self-taught linguist, who translated from Arabic, Persian and
                        Hebrew.</note> which I had heard of and wished to see. In the winter of 1796 I was introduced to her on the South Parade at
                    Bath, by <ref target="people.html#LoshJames">James Losh</ref>, a gentleman now settled at Newcastle, and practising as a
                    provincial counsel, – one of the best and most estimable men in all respects whom it has ever been my good fortune to know. He
                    borrowed of her for me Carlyle’s translations from the Arabic, then newly published.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Joseph Dacre Carlyle (1758–1804; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Specimens of Arabian Poetry</title> (1796).</note> From that time
                    I neither saw nor knew anything of her till about three years ago, when, hearing that one of Mrs. Smith’s daughters, at Coniston,
                    understood Hebrew, I knew that she must be the person to whom I had formerly been made known; but I made no attempt at renewing
                    the acquaintance, because there is a haughtiness and harshness about her mother<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Smith’s
                        mother, Julia, née Mott, had been an heiress and had lived a life of great wealth at Piercefield house, near Chepstow, until
                        her banker husband George lost his fortune when Britain went to war with France in 1793.</note> which are to me exceedingly
                    offensive. Not many weeks before her death I chanced to meet her and her mother in a one-horse chair, when I was in an open
                    carriage with one of her acquaintance. Death was in her countenance; my friend stopped to talk with them, but I merely bowed my
                    head: that was not a time to remind her of days when she was in health; she had evidently no breath to spare in waste words, and
                    the sight of her made me melancholy for the rest of the day. Indeed I have her, as she then appeared, vividly in my recollection
                    now. You liken her to <ref target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</ref>; but genius is wanting on her part for the
                    resemblance, for of this there is no trace to be found among her Fragments. There is great good sense, great acquirements,
                    prodigious industry, and, what is most admirable, a pure love of knowledge for its own sake, – for the quiet enjoyment, and the
                    holy self-satisfaction which it afforded.</p><p rend="indent1"> With Crabbe’s poems<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> George Crabbe (1754–1832; <title>DNB</title>), author
                        of <title>The Library</title> (1781) and <title>The Village</title> (1783).</note> I have been acquainted for about twenty
                    years, having read them when a schoolboy on their first publication, and, by the help of the Elegant Extracts,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Elegant Extracts: or, Useful and Entertaining Pieces of Poetry, Selected for the Improvement of Young Persons</title>
                        (many editions from the 1780s).</note> remembered from that time what was best worth remembering. You rightly compare him to
                        Goldsmith.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Oliver Goldsmith (1728?–1774; <title>DNB</title>), author of <title>The
                            Deserted Village</title> (1770).</note> He is an imitator, or rather an <hi rend="ital">antithesizer</hi>, of Goldsmith,
                    if such a word may be coined for the occasion. His merit is precisely the same as Goldsmith’s, – that of describing actual things
                    clearly and strikingly; but there is a wide difference between the colouring of the two poets. Goldsmith threw a sunshine over all
                    his pictures, like that of one of our water-colour artists when he paints for ladies, – a light and a beauty not to be found in
                    Nature, though not more brilliant or beautiful than what Nature really affords. Crabbe’s have a gloom, which is also not in
                    Nature, – not the shade of a heavy day, of mist, or of clouds, but the dark and overcharged shadows of one who paints by
                    lamp-light, – whose very lights have a gloominess. In part this is explained by his history. He had formed an attachment in early
                    life to a young woman who, like himself, was absolutely without fortune; he wrote his poems to obtain patronage and preferment. In
                    those days there was not much good poetry, and hardly any negligent criticism. He <hi rend="ital">pushed</hi> (as the world says)
                    for patronage with these poems, and succeeded; got preferment sufficient, and married. It was not long before his wife became
                        deranged,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Crabbe’s wife Sarah Elmy (1751–1813; <title>DNB</title>) became a manic
                        depressive in the 1790s after the deaths of three of their children.</note> and when all this was told me by one who knew him
                    well, five years ago, he was still almost confined in his own house, anxiously waiting upon this wife in her long and hopeless
                    malady. A sad history! It is no wonder that he gives so melancholy a picture of human life.</p><p rend="indent1"> Mr. Catton<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas Catton (1758–1838; <title>DNB</title>), tutor of St
                        John’s College, Cambridge, praised in Southey’s <title>Remains</title> for his fatherly solicitude towards White. Catton had
                        visited Southey at Keswick earlier in September.</note> could tell me little of <ref target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</ref> with which we had not previously been made acquainted. He has the merit of having discovered his genius and his
                    good qualities himself, for nothing had been said to him upon the subject; and this is a great merit. It was not till some months
                    after <ref target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</ref> had resided that Mr. C. heard of his little volume;<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> Henry Kirke White’s <title>Clifton Grove, a Sketch in Verse, with other Poems</title>
                        (1803).</note> and when he mentioned it to him, <ref target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</ref> was very much abashed,
                    said that he was heartily sorry he had published it, and heartily ashamed, but that it must be considered that he was very young.
                    Mr. C. requested to see the book, and was much pleased with it. He could not, of course, encourage him in pursuits which might
                    have interfered with his academical studies; – no person in his situation could do that. It is not yet generally understood that
                    of all men, a great poet, such as <ref target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</ref> might probably have been, exercises the
                    most extensive and most useful influence over mankind. Compare the effects produced by Homer and by Alexander the Great.</p><closer><salute rend="indent1"> God bless you.</salute><signed rend="indent2"> R. S.</signed></closer></div></body></text></TEI>
