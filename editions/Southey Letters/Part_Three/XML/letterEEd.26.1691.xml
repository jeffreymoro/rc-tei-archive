                    history is without a blot. Their American has, unhappily, some bloody ones, which you will see noticed in the next number of the
                    Quarterly, if my reviewal of Holmes’s American Annals should appear there in an unmutilated state.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey reviewed Abiel Holmes (1763–1837), <title>American Annals; or, a Chronological History of America,

                    Collyer’s is, certainly, an able book; yet he is better calculated to produce effect from the pulpit than in the study. Those
                    parts of his Lectures which are most ornamental and, doubtless, the most popular in delivery, are usually extraneous to the main
                    subject in hand. All his congregations would fairly say ‘What a fine discourse!’ to every sermon; but, when the whole are read
                    collectively, they do not exhibit that clear and connected view of prophecy which is what he should have aimed at. There is,
                    perhaps, hardly any subject which requires so much erudition, and so constant an exertion of sound judgment. The Doctor’s learning
                    is not extensive; he quotes from books of little authority, and never refers to those which are of most importance. Indeed, he
                    does not appear to know what the Germans have done in Biblical criticism.</p><p rend="indent1"> .        .        .

                    visited Klopstock in the year 1797: he wore a great wig. Klopstock in a wig, they said, was something like <hi rend="ital">Mr.</hi> Milton. His Life will always retain its interest; his fame as a poet will not be lasting.

                    already passing away. There is no other country where the principle of criticism is so well understood. But one loves Klopstock as
                    well as if he had been really the poet that his admirers believe him to be; and his wife was as much an angel as she could be
