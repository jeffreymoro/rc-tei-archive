Your best plan will be to cross the sands from
                    Lancaster to Ulverstone, – from whence you will see <ref target="places.html#FurnessAbbey">Furness Abbey</ref>. Proceed up
                    Coniston Lake, &amp; then strike across to the Ferry on Winandermere, – cross there &amp; go along the opposite bank to Ambleside.
                    Ryedale, Grasmere &amp; Thirlmere lie on the road to <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>. From Keswick you will visit
                    the Lakes which lie to the W. &amp; S.W of us, Crummock &amp; Buttermere, &amp; Ennerdale &amp; Was-water, the two last are seldom
                    visited by tourists, tho they are remarkably fine. Ulswater should be taken on your return to Ambleside. This is the only plan by
                    which every lake can be approached, in the proper manner, &amp; you need not be told how the effect of such scenery is impaired by
                    entering from the head instead of the foot. There is a good deal to be seen about Ambleside as well as about Keswick, but you had
                    better practise mountaineering in the neighbourhood first, &amp; when you return to Ambleside I will take care to meet you there
                    if possible, or if not to provide you with a suitable guide. – The common tourist road is very good &amp; will do for any
                    carriage, – the wilder &amp; finer parts of the country can only be <del>seen</del> reached on foot or on horseback.</p><p rend="indent1"> Our summers begin late &amp; continue long. If it were not that evening sets in so soon I should say autumn is the
                    best season for coming, but summer evenings on the lake are so delightful that you should come in time for them.</p><p rend="indent1"> I am sorry to say <ref target="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers</ref> has no thoughts of revisiting Keswick yet
                    he talked perhaps of my visiting him, which I <del>xxx</del> shall do during the winter. </p><p rend="indent1"> Lord Howick was wise in not contesting Northumberland, because according to all human probability he must soon be
                    called to the House of Lords by his fathers death.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Charles Grey, Viscount Howick
                        (1764–1845; <title>DNB</title>), became 2nd Earl Grey upon the death of his father Charles Grey, 1st Earl Grey (1729–1807;
                            <title>DNB</title>) in November. Howick was First Lord of the Admiralty from 1806 but did not contest the election to the
                        House of Commons in spring 1807 because his sponsor, Hugh Percy, second Duke of Northumberland (1742–1817;
                        <title>DNB</title>), withdrew his support in favour of his own son, Lord Percy, who had just come of age. Grey took his seat
                        in the House of Lords in January 1808.</note> Lord Percy should rather have thrown out Colonel Beaumont, a man of more than ordinary
                        imbecility.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Colonel Thomas Richard Beaumont (1758–1829), of Hexham Abbey,
                        Northumberland, was the second MP for the Northumberland constituency from 1795–1818. Enriched by the mining interests that he
                        acquired on marriage, Beaumont was widely thought to benefit considerably from his wife’s advice.</note> What Percys talents
                    may be we have not yet seen. I like him for retiring from Westminster<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Duke of
                        Northumberland, in an effort to ensure his son maximised his chances of being returned for parliament, had also entered Percy
                        for the constituencies of Launceston and Westminster.</note> in deference to the feelings of the people, &amp; I like him also
                    for proposing the gradual abolition of slavery as well as of the slave trade.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Hugh Percy, Earl Percy
                        (1785–1847; <title>DNB</title>) had, on 17 March, proposed a motion in parliament for the gradual abolition of slavery in
                        Britain’s Caribbean colonies.</note></p><p rend="indent1"><ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">My brother</ref> is on board the Pallas, a ship which Lord Cochrane formerly commanded, &amp;
                    which I wish he commanded now.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas Southey’s ship, launched in 1804, was a 32 gun fifth
                        rate frigate, whose first captain was Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald (1775–1860), a daring ship’s captain in the
                        Napoleonic war, under whom she was involved in the capture of many French and Spanish warships. In 1807, command passed to
                        Captain George Miller (dates unknown).</note> He has left behind him the highest possible character both as a man &amp; an
                    officer, &amp; there seems great reason to expect great things from him. I am well pleased with his speeches upon the hustings,
                    &amp; particularly with his attack upon Lord S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Vincent, who is the tyrant that he described him to be.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Cochrane, angry because he felt corruption in the administration of the navy had denied him
                        and his men prize money and promotion, stood for election in April 1807 for the seat of Westminster, and attacked from the
                        hustings the conduct of John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent (1735–1823; <title>DNB</title>), former First Lord of the
                        Admiralty (until 1804) and, from 1806 to 1807, Commander of the Channel fleet.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> We beg to be remembered to Miss Smith<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas Smith’s sister.</note> &amp;
