                    they act just contrary to the manner in which they are commonly supposed to do, – &amp; that when persons fix the day or hour for
                    their death, &amp; are punctual to the engagement, they are kept alive to that moment by their faith that they shall not die

                    the most delightful; &amp; no employment ever gave me more pleasure than that of reducing it to the shape in which it now appears.

                    been made, &amp; it proved to be only a truce, – but that gives him all he wanted, &amp; we get only a breathing time by it, when
                    blessed be God we are not out of breath. Is there any man in England fool enough to believe that the word or oath of Bonaparte is
