                        <title>Poems</title> to make up for the removal of the ‘Vision’ were, ‘Translation of a Greek Ode on Astronomy, written for the prize at Cambridge, 1793’ (pp. 3–9); ‘The Retrospect’ (pp. 13–22); ‘To Hymen’ (pp. 25–39); ‘Remembrance’ (pp. 40–43); ‘To Recovery’ (pp. 49–51); ‘Youth and Age’ (pp. 52–53); ‘The Traveller’s Return’ (pp. 54–55); ‘Autumn’ (pp. 56–58); ‘The Destruction of Jerusalem’ (pp. 59–62); ‘The Spanish Armada’ (pp. 63–66); ‘St Bartholomew’s Day’ (pp. 67–69); ‘To a Bee’ (pp. 74–75); ‘Metrical Letter’, pp. 76–79.

                        how an Old Woman Rode Double and Who Rode Before Her’, (more familiarly known as ‘The Old Woman of Berkeley’) was published in
                            <title>Poems</title>, 2 vols (Bristol, 1799), II, pp. [143]–160. In his letter to Southey of 23 December 1798, Taylor had
                        revealed that he had also written a poem on the theme of the ‘Old Woman of Berkeley’ (J. W. Robberds (ed.), <title>A Memoir of
                            the Life and Writings of the Late William Taylor of Norwich</title>, 2 vols (London, 1843), I, p. 235). This was written
                        in about 1791, but remained unpublished for many years until its appearance in the <title>Iris</title>, the weekly Norwich
                        newspaper edited by Taylor, on 29 October 1803. Taylor declined Southey’s offer to publish his poem, and ‘A Tale of Wonder’
                        was published in the <title>Monthly Magazine</title> 34 (1812), 234–236. See David Chandler, ‘Southey’s “German Sublimity” and
                        Coleridge’s “Dutch Attempt’, in <title>Romanticism on the Net</title>, 32–33 (November 2003).</note> most people will be as

                    other things. You have probably seen <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> by this time, – at least whether

                    odour at Edinburgh, &amp; well may he be so, for among Scotch metaphysicians he may pass for learned. As far as I can judge he
                    seems to have chosen his associates well, – to have culled the shining men for his acquaintance, the good ones for his
