                    <title>Expedition de los Catalanes y Araguneses</title> (1623), f. 19, thinks the name refers rather to their origin than their
                    customs, and that they were descended from the Avars’, <title>Chronicle of the Cid</title> (London, 1808), p. 418.</note> My preface, introduction &amp; a portion of the notes are
                    on the eve of their departure for London – Frere has not yet sent me his translations, – &amp; I am now in want of them, to insert
                    in their place among the remaining notes.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Angelo Maria Bandini (1726–1803), <title>Vita e

                        had parodied Southey’s radical ballads in ‘The Friend of Humanity and the Knife-grinder’ in the <title>Antijacobin</title>
                        (1797). Three of Frere’s translations from the <title>Poema del Cid</title> were appended to Southey’s edition of the
                            <title>Chronicle of the Cid</title>. Frere had been Britain’s ambassador to Portugal while Southey’s uncle had lived
                        there; from 1808–1809 he was ambassador to Spain.</note> Will you write &amp; ask him to transmit them, – I <del>do</del> am

                    resembling it in meaning, – but it is manifestly to be found in this Catalan author. He is speaking of the Usages which Count

                        place, the said Count fixed the rank of the other Counts, granting them power over the Viscounts, [who are] noble Valvassors
                        occupying the highest rank after the above-mentioned Counts in terms of power, except for the nine barons to whom the said
                        Count gave the same rank as the Counts and called them <title>Commodores</title>, as if to say that they were like Counts to
                        the vassals in their signiories and baronies.’ See the <title>Chronicle of the Cid</title> (London, 1808), p. 403.</note> – I do not understand the
                    composition of the word so as to find this meaning in it, – Tomich no doubt did. – I very much wish we had more of the Catalan
