                    saying he was arrived at the R Oak, &amp; would be happy to wait on me at whatever hour I might appoint, – so I asked him to
                    dinner, – a lucky piece of civility on my part, – inasmuch as it appeared afterwards that he was come from Penrith on purpose to
                    see me, &amp; returned there the same night. Of this I had not the smallest suspicion. The matter was this: I had in a letter to
                        <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> said that a Review of old books, – that is of any books, except such as were
                    in the province in the contemporary Criticism, – would answer if it were well conducted. Scott talked this over in London, &amp;
                        <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJames">Ballantyne</ref> returning from thence came commissioned to treat with me about such
                    a work. Things will not be finally settled till I have seen <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> who offers to take a
                    great share in the work, if I will conduct it – I am offered 100 a year as editor, – &amp; ten guineas a sheet. the thing to be in

                    shall need no other lucre-of-gain work, for the quantity of my own contributions will depend upon myself, &amp; I can with ease
                    write 150 pounds worth in the year. The trouble as Editor is merely that of writing letters, receiving articles, suiting them to
                    the number, &amp; correcting proof sheets – And as I would not begin till I had the quantity for two numbers ready, – all anxiety

                        of allegations that he had profited by allowing his mistress, Mary Anne Clarke (c. 1776–1852; <title>DNB</title>), to accept
                        money from army officers, in return for which promotion was arranged. In May 1811 the <ref target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince Regent</ref> reinstated his brother as Commander-in-Chief of the army, a
                        post which he held for the rest of his life.</note> – thereby implying a fear that they would defend him, which would destroy
                    the Review. My immediate answer was that if they did, – or if they took up the Anti-Jacobins politics I should immediately
                    withdraw, – &amp; in all likelihood this will be the case, unless the foreknowledge which they must have of this determination of
