                    appeared to me so doubtful, or, indeed, so improbable an event, that the certainty comes on me like a surprise, and I feel at once
                    what a separation the sea makes; when we get beyond the reach of mail coaches, then, indeed, distance becomes a thing perceptible.

                        thee’. It comes from William Shenstone’s (1714–1763; <title>DNB</title>) epitaph on Maria Dolman (d. 1754), ‘On an ornamented
                        urn. Inscribed to Miss Dolman, a beautiful and amiable relation of Mr Shenstone’s, who died of the smallpox, about twenty-one
                        years of age’.</note> God grant you a speedy passage, a speedy recovery, and a speedy return! I will write regularly and
                    often; but I know by <ref target="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers</ref>, how irregularly letters arrive, and at how tedious a
                    time after their date. Look in old Knolles before you go, and read the siege of Malta, it will make you feel that you are going to
                    visit sacred ground.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Richard Knolles (c. 1545–1610) describes the unsuccessful epic siege

                    feel when Peter the Porter opens the door upstairs, and says, Please to walk in, sir. That I shall never be paid for my labour
                    according to the current value of time and labour, is tolerably certain; but if anyone should offer me 10,000 <hi rend="ital">l</hi>. to forego that labour, I should bid him and his money go to the devil, for twice the sum could not purchase me half
                    the enjoyment. It will be a great delight to me in the next world, to take a fly and visit these old worthies, who are my only
                    society here, and to tell them, what excellent company I found them here at the lakes of Cumberland, two centuries after they had
                    been dead and turned to dust. In plain truth, I exist more among the dead than the living, and think more about them, and,
                    perhaps, feel more about them.                    .

                    anyone in the house, or, indeed, in the kingdom. I have promised him Asia; it is a pity that Africa and America are so badly
                    divided as to be almost useless, for this is an excellent way of learning geography, and I know by experience that what is so
