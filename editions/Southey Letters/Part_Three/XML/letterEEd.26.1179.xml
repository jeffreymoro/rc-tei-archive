The fact is that after
                    consulting upon <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncles</ref> business well with his friends in London, it was not
                    thought necessary for me to visit Herefordshire. Bristol then became as much out of the question as out of the way – I put myself
                    into the Carlisle mail on Saturday evening, &amp; arrived safe &amp; sound yesterday afternoon. The noise of the coach is still in
                    my ears, &amp; my solids seem to be jellified by so much shaking. but I am quite well, thank God, &amp; heartily happy to feel
                    myself at home, by my own fire side, &amp; once more in my Cumberland costume.</p><p rend="indent1"> London never agreed with me so ill – I caught a severe cold &amp; cough, &amp; felt my breathing much affected by
                    that cursed composition of smoke, dust, smuts, human breath, &amp; marsh vapour, which passes for an atmosphere in the metropolis.
                    For ten days I was unwell enough to render it quite prudent to abstain from animal food &amp; all fermented liquors; so wherever I
                    went I dined upon fish &amp; vegetables like a Catholic in Lent, &amp; drank water as rigidly as a Turk. It served me also as an
                    excuse for refusing invitations which I had no wish to accept, so I past much part of my time at home, that is at <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickmans</ref>, &amp; usually got to bed at my own right seasonable hour, as soon as the

                    who made the hours quite pleasant to me. I was left at perfect liberty, &amp; no difference was made in the domestic arrangement
                    whether I dined there or abroad. John the boy,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Rickman’s servant (last name and dates

                    stairs whenever I chose – to bring me biscuits cheese &amp; ale when I was hungry, run on errands for me whenever I was pleased to

                    will produce me fifteen shillings, but it will be long before they drop off, if ever they do during my life. However we shall
                    print a small edition in two volumes without loss of time; in which there will be no alterations, that the quarto may retain its
                    full value, in wh[ich] case it will still find some purchasers who like to pay for good margins, &amp; fill quarto shelves.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey’s poem <title>Madoc</title> was published by <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> in 1805, in a luxurious quarto, costing two guineas.

                        because he hoped this would prevent negative reviews from his enemies, which he feared would have a detrimental effect on its
