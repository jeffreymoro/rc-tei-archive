                    taking a very roundabout road for the sake of a frank. I thank you for spreading her fame, &amp; marvel at your marvellous
                    memory.</p><p rend="indent1"> I thank you also for what you say concerning Constable.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Archibald Constable
                        (1774–1827; <title>DNB</title>), the Edinburgh publisher of Scott’s <title>Lay of the Last Minstrel</title> (1805) and
                            <title>Marmion</title> (1807).</note> It is certain that no man who gets any credit at all by his writings can get less
                    money by them than I do, but in this it must be the book-buying &amp; not the bookselling animal that is in fault. It does not
                    seem probable that Constable can have more means of pushing a book than <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Our Fathers which
                        are in the Row</ref> have, &amp; unless he could make more by me than they do, I could not make more by him. The truth is that
                    all my books, except those early works of which the copy right is gone, sell badly. I sold to <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> the first edition of Thalaba<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801).</note> (of 1000 copies) for 115 £. this was seven years ago, &amp; <del>ver</del>
                    between two &amp; three hundred are still upon hand. I let him print Madoc<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Madoc</title> (1805).</note> upon terms no better than they grant to an untried author, that of sharing the eventual
                    profits: in the course of two years my share has been five &amp; twenty pounds. – Half my time is employed in writing reviewals
                    for the Annual,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The <title>Annual Review</title>.</note> translating romances &amp; such
                    sort of unworthy work to eke out a very scanty income. Assuredly I could in that <del>por</del> quantity of time which is thus
                    employed every year, produce such a poem as Thalaba, but seven hundred copies would be seven years in selling. Were my income
                    sufficient this would signify nothing, – I should do <del>this</del> &lt;it&gt; for pleasure, be perfectly satisfied with the fame
                    I get, &amp; care nothing for profit. – There is no hardship in this sacrifice of half my time, – any profession would require as
                    much or more, &amp; tho any profession would be far more lucrative, as long as I have enough I am contented, &amp; more than
                    contented.</p><p rend="indent1"> You may see by this statement that Constable overrates the utility of a connection with me, – which must be of more
                    consequence to Longman than it could be to him, because I bear so large a part in the Annual Review. – I have however about a
                    thousand lines by me of a poem called The Curse of Kehama, of which Hindoo superstition is the basis, as the Mohammedan fault was
                    the basis of Thalaba. It is written like Thalaba, with this difference that there is a frequent intermixture of rhymes, – my
                    design <del>beg</del> being to buoy up by rhyme those parts in which there was least passion. If compleated it would extend to the
                    same length, – that is about 6000 lines, with about the same proportion of notes. What would he give me for an edition of this
                    poem were I to finish it, the form &amp; number of the edition &lt;being&gt; of course at his option? If his offer tempted me to
                    proceed, I would communicate it to Longman – (to whom I should consider myself so far bound,) &amp; give him the refusal of it at
                    that price. On his refusal it should be Constables.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Curse of Kehama</title> was published by <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> in 1810.</note> – I
                    had formed an intention of going thro all the most remarkable mythologies, &amp; building up a romance upon each; &amp; had
                    conceived the stories &amp; collected materials for most of them.</p><p rend="indent1"> If the romance you mention be the old Poema del Cid edited by Sanchez<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Tomás

                        the <title>Antijacobin</title> (1797). Three of Frere’s translations from the<title> Poema del Cid</title> were appended to

                    justifiable, for the poem is unquestionably the elder, &amp; is in great part the obvious source of the chronicle. – My ballads
