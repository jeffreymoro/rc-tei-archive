                        Thomas Rowley, a fictitious fifteenth-century monk. Chatterton is thought to have concocted his medieval diction by reading

                        Melville’s use of public funds when Treasurer of the Admiralty (1782–1800) was investigated by a Royal Commission. It found
                        that Melville had allowed Trotter to divert government funds to his personal accounts and on 9 April 1805 Melville was
                        censured in the House of Commons for allowing Trotter to misuse public funds. Melville resigned and impeachment proceedings
