                    weather has led me day after day mountaineering with a long succession of visitors. We have a round of company here which intrudes
                    upon many an evening. <ref target="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppa</ref> is with me – &amp; all these interruptions &amp;
                    temptations give such assistance to my printer in our race that he is hard upon my heels.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Southey was correcting proofs of <title>Madoc</title> (1805) and still revising sections of the manuscript not yet sent to the
                        printer.</note> – First to business. thus says <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref>. Danvers’s commission
                    went by the first opportunity that offered after its arrival, – by the Medusa Frigate, for Gibralter; which met with a Line of
                    Battle Ship that ordered her, I suppose, on a cruise, &amp; took her mails from her, whether D.s Butter, Cheese &amp; Paper were
                    reckoned as dispatches &amp; forwarded likewise I do not know, but if they were not, this is the last he will ever hear of them.
                    His letter to his brother I sent over land. I wrote likewise by the same Post to him &amp; to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Pownall the
                        agent,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Unidentified.</note> that he might keep a sharp look out after the Medusa,
                    &amp; recover the encom̄endas.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Meaning ‘orders’.</note> – This is but a bad account, &amp;
                    the only consolation is that nobody was in fault. – Next to my wine merchant. I shall be glad if he will send me three dozen of
                    port, &amp; three of Bucellas or Vidonia,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> White wines produced in Portugal and Tenerife
                        respectively.</note> whichever can be procured easiest &amp; best, &amp; send them as before – if more convenient to pack one
                    or two dozen more according to the size of the tierce no matter, but let any such additional quantity be port. the Captain should
                    apprize me by a line from Liverpool when he has sent them off &amp; by what conveyance.</p><p rend="indent1"> I corrected this evening the 38th sheet of Madoc which brings it down to the beginning of the old tenth book, now
                    the fourteenth section of the second part, &amp; I have also this evening just finished the revision of Madocs combat with
                        Coanocotzin.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> See <title>Madoc</title> (1805), Part 2, book 18.</note> this last part
                    will extend to 28 sections. seven are wholly new in story, &amp; I have yet one new one to write, but it will not extend to 100
                    lines. another fortnight will conclude my work, &amp; three weeks bring the printer to the notes. in all there are about 2500
                    lines of story added in this revision – the alterations in these latter books are fewer than I expected – yet I hope they
                    materially improve them. On the whole however it would have been easier to have written a new poem than to have tinkered this,
                    &amp; after all I am not in the best humour with it myself.</p><p rend="indent1"><hi rend="ital">Now</hi>, when the time of your visit would have been over, I am glad that you have not been, &amp; that it is

                    &amp; to hear the remains of a cough which threatens very badly. I urged her very strongly to take care of herself, &amp; strongly
                    recommended Lisbon<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Lisbon, easily reached by sea and with an established British factory,

                    had resolved in my own mind to write to her brother &amp; press him upon the subject more urgently, for there appeared to me great
                    danger lest she should go there too late. ‘I will wait &amp; try the winter’ is easily said, &amp; without considering what it is
                    that depends upon the trial. If you should hear that she continues unwell do write to him &amp; tell him what I say. – Miss
                    Kennedy seemed much broken, the Miss Bailey was neither the one whom I had seen, nor the one who wanted to see me. – We have also
