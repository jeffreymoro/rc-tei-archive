                        vols (London, 1807), I, pp. 418–429. In his letter Southey is advising Bedford on the collection and transcription of texts

                    to correct it? The words omitted are precisely those which mark the Dukes sentiment &amp; character of mind.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby (1647–1721; <title>DNB</title>), politician
                        and author who is included in the <title>Specimens</title>, I, 219–222. Southey is complaining that Bedford has omitted, from
                        the Duke’s epitaph for his own tomb, the words ‘Christum adveneror’ (‘venerator of Christ’); see Southey to Grosvenor Charles
                        Bedford, 26 July 1805, Letter 1086. Bedford had copied the inscription as it appeared on Buckingham’s monument, rather than as
                        originally written. According to William Betham, <title>The Baronetage of England: or The History of the English
                            Baronets</title>, 5 vols (London, 1801–1805), III, 251, ‘the words, “Christum adveneror,” are omitted, at the desire, as
                        is said, of bishop Atterbury, who thought the verb <hi rend="ital">adveneror</hi> not full enough, as applied to Christ. Great
                        clamours were raised against this epitaph, many asserting that it proved the Duke a sceptic; and as great a trifle as it may
                        seem, his grace’s orthodoxy became the subject of a controversy: it was, however, defended in form by Dr. Fiddes, in “A Letter
                        to a Freethinker,” 1721’.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> Send me the names of the 80 because it is very likely that I may be shortly at Edinburgh, &amp; there I would look

                    too hard upon an individual.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> In December 1804, the naval ship HMS <hi rend="ital">Amelia</hi>, of which Thomas Southey was a lieutenant, had captured the Spanish brig <hi rend="ital">Isabella</hi> and
                        the ship <hi rend="ital">Conception</hi>, both laden with wine and brandy, and the ship <hi rend="ital">Commerce</hi>, laden
                        with cotton. It was customary for naval officers to be allotted a share of the value of ships and cargo captured in armed
                        conflict, but this award of prize money was contested because it was claimed that the ships were captured before war was
                        officially declared. Southey took up his brother’s cause to have his share reinstated. It was presumably Southey’s influence
                        that caused <title>The Courier</title> to publish a paragraph supporting the sailors’ claim to the prize-money on Saturday 24
                        August 1805. This was followed by a longer defence of their position in <title>The Courier</title> on 31 August 1805 under the
                        title ‘Indemnification to the Spanish Merchants’.</note> It is not impossible but the measure may be given up if the matter be
