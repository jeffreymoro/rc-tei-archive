                    Introduction to be what it ought to have been, what I could have made it, would have required a volume to itself, – for my reading
                    is far more extensive on these subjects than almost any person can suppose. It is a rapid sketch, just sufficient to introduce the
                    Chronicle, by giving the reader a summary view of the previous history &amp; existing state of Spain. The Chronicle is well done
                    &amp; the translation improves so much on the original, by incorporating matter from other sources, as to be unique in its kind.
                    There is a good deal of miscellaneous matter brought together in the notes, more meo.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    find every where. The Cids speech<del>es</del> at the Cortes is perfect eloquence of its kind. If it be remembered that all this
                    was written in all probability before the year 1200, certainly within half a century sooner or later, – I think it must be
                    considered as one of the most curious &amp; valuable <del>poems</del> specimens of early literature, certainly as the most

                    says &amp; very justly that our troops to Spain might have &lt;been&gt; conveyed in half the time, at half the expence, &amp;
                    without any risque at all, by putting as many on board some of our large ships of war as they could take, (800 or 1000 they could
                    carry very well) &amp; letting each ship make the best of her way to the port nearest the scene of action. A convoy may be wind
                    bound for months, &amp; any single transport which parts company would fall to the first privateer – Whereas a ship of the line
                    could beat down, take advantage of every slant of wind, – &amp; defy all upon the ocean. – There is very good sense in this. But
