                        Grosvenor Bedford’s pamphlet and in his next letter of 27 November he had received it and comments on it. In this letter
                        Southey had just heard about the events on HMS <hi rend="ital">Galatea,</hi> which are first mentioned in a letter to
                        Grosvenor Bedford of 2 November 1805.</note></head><opener><salute>Dear Wynn</salute></opener><p rend="indent1"> I fear M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Gough is as much in a mistake about Iorwerth as about S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                    Moncella. Hic jaciet <hi rend="ital">Madicus</hi> would be a very odd epitaph for a man whose name was Edward, &amp; I certainly
                    can make out nothing like Edwardus or Etwardus in the inscription, either by shape or either number of letters.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey and Wynn are discussing the inscription on a tomb at Pennant Melangell church, Powys,
                        where the funerary monument of St Melangell (St Moncella; c. 590), patron saint of hares and rabbits, is situated. Madoc’s
                        brother Iorwerth ab Owain Gwynedd or Iorwerth Drwyndwn (1145–1174), was killed in a battle near the spot. In the churchyard is
                        a stone with the figure of an armed man which once covered a grave: on the shield, bearing a lion rampant, is inscribed the
                        legend ‘<hi rend="ital">Hic Jacet Etwart</hi>’. See William Camden (1551–1623; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Britannia: or, a
                            Chronological Description of the Flourishing Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the Islands Adjacent; from

                        535.</note> The tradition however is enough for the purposes of poetry, but the antiquarian illustration which would have
                    looked so learned when cut in wood – must I am afraid be given up as untenable. Pennants drawing is cross-legged<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The stone and figure are described in Thomas Pennant (1726–1798), <title>A Tour in
