                        ‘History of Portugal’ was never completed.</note> – a country of which I probably now know more than any foreigner, &amp; as
                    much as any native. now has it come athwart me this afternoon how much more accurate, &amp; perhaps a thousand years hence more
                    valuable a book it would be, were I to write the History of Wine Street below-the-Pump – the street wherein I was born, recording
                    the revolutions of every house during twenty years. It almost startles me to <del>xxxx the events</del> see how the events of
                    private life, within my own knowledge – et quorum pars maxima,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Meaning ‘of which the
                        largest part’.</note> &amp;c – equal – or out do novel &amp; comedy – &amp; the conclusion to each tale – the Mors omnibus
                        communis<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Meaning ‘death is common to all men’.</note> – makes me more serious than the
                    sight of my own grey hairs in the glass – for the hoar frosts Grosvenor are begun with me. – Oh there would be matter for
                    moralizing in such a history – beyond all that history offers. The very title is a sermon – you in London need to be told that
                    Wine Street is a street in Bristol, &amp; that there is a Pump in it – &amp; that by the title I would mean to express that the
                    historian <del>is not xxx</del> does not extend his subject to that larger division of the street which lies above the Pump – you
                    I say need all these explanations &amp; yet when I first went to school I never thought of Wine Street &amp; of that Pump without
                    tears, &amp; such a sorrow at heart – as by heaven no child of mine shall ever suffer while I am living to prevent it! &amp; so
                    deeply are <del>those</del> the feelings connected with that place rooted in me, that perhaps in the hour of death they will be
                    the last that survive. </p><p rend="indent1"> Now this history it is most certain that I the Portugueze Historiographer &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c shall never have

                    me begin with the Church<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Old Christ Church, taken down in 1786.</note> at the corner. I
                    remember the <hi rend="ital">old</hi> Church, a row of little shops were built before it, above which its windows received light,
                    &amp; on the leads which roofd them, crowds used to stand at the chairing of Members – &amp; &lt;as they&gt; did to my remembrance

                    awake after dinner to hear him. A worldly, pudding-faced, bag-bellied, oystery-eyed<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Southey includes a footnote: ‘I took my fat-swoln eyes of Gluttony in Joan of Arc from him’. His poem <title>Joan of

                        were amalgamated in 1788.</note> for no other conceivable reason than that he might be Rector of both. However he was a great
                    man – &amp; it was the custom once a year to catechise the children &amp; give them – if they answered well – a good plumb-cake
                    apiece on the last day of the examination – called a cracknell, &amp; honestly worth a groat, &amp; I can remember eating my
                    cracknell – &amp; being very proud of the praise of the Curate (– who was a really good man) when he found that I knew the
                    etymology of <hi rend="ital">Decalogue</hi>,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> That is, ten axioms or commandments.</note>
                    for be it known to your worship that I did not leave off loving plumbcake when I begun my Greek, nor have I left it off now that I
                    have almost forgotten it. – But I must turn back to the <hi rend="ital">Pew</hi> to tell you how in my very young days, a certain
                        <ref target="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">Uncle Thomas</ref>, who would make a conspicuous <del>history</del> figure in
                    the history of Wine Street below the Pump, once sentenced me to be deprived of my share of Pye on Sunday, for some misdemeanour
                    there committed – I forget what – whether talking to my brother <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref>, or reading the
                    Revelations during sermon – for <hi rend="ital">that</hi> was my favourite part of the Xtian religion – &amp; I always amused
                    myself with the scraps &lt;from it&gt; after the Collects, whenever the prayer book was in my hand. However the punishment was
                    inflicted – &amp; a cruel one it was Grosvenor, &amp; annoyed <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my poor mother</ref> as
                    she has since told me, &lt;even&gt; more than it did me, but I devised a very extraordinary mode of revenge. I got my little
                    brother <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> (who had a very feeling <del>xxxxxxx</del> &lt;sense&gt; of this inhuman

                    Abraham that whosoever he curst should be cursed<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Genesis</title> 12: 3.</note> – &amp; I proved to Tom that this power of cursing was intailed – &amp; that he &amp; I
                    were of the seed of the faithful, &amp; then we swore our bellyfull at <ref target="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">Uncle

                    at Goa, the child of an English Colonel by a native woman – nor can I now remember the strange unhappiness that left her destitute
                    in England. however in that capacity she was in my childhood – an excellent good woman, about my mothers age – &amp; with whom we
                    were upon next-door terms in the best sense of the word. To her my mother showd my very first verses when I was seven years old –
                    they were upon happiness &amp; that is all I know – but there was a second copy, which success &amp; their approbation encouraged
                    me to write – &amp; those I remember because they were <hi rend="ital">not quite so good</hi>. they relate to virtue – &amp; I
                    well recollect contained a pathetic exhortation against robbery for fear of the gallows – For if to London or to York you <hi rend="ital">gang</hi> Under a gibbet you are sure to <hi rend="ital">hang</hi>. the couplet sticks in my mind like birdlime,
                    &amp; also how I had written <hi rend="ital">Bath</hi> at first, but Bath being too familiar to me who livd at Bristol &amp; was
                    often there, &amp; moreover hanging not being commonly practiced in that place of amusement those considerations induced me to
                    alter it to York. This poor Miss Reynolds was courted at last by one Browne, <ref target="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">my
                        fathers</ref> shopman.<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors"> Untraced.</note> it is a sad story. The before named thought
                    it became him to apprize Brownes Uncle – on whom the young man depended – a plague on his meddling! Browne was removed &amp;

                    sorrow in thinking that they were only represented – only stage Quarter Boys – &amp; not the real ones. – The Church was
                    demolished, &amp; sad things were said of the indecencies that occurred in removing the coffins for the new foundations to be
