                    fear least I should mention it – after death &lt;might&gt; have dissolved it – a sort of superstitious feeling to which I am
                    subject. I wish you – being a father myself – as large a family – as you can comfortably <del>suppor</del> bring up, – &amp; if
                    you are not provided with a godfather upon the next occasion I beg you to accept of me – as an old &amp; very affectionate friend;
                    – tis a <del>sort</del> voluntary kind of relationship in which it would gratify me to stand to a child of yours, &amp; which I

                    last materials for my history, &amp; to visit those parts of the kingdom which I have not yet seen.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey never returned to Portugal after his second residence there in 1800–1801, and his planned ‘History of
                        Portugal’ was never completed.</note> In this case my way will lie thro Devonshire, &amp; I will stop a day or two at Crediton

                    for his life was very irregular, &amp; it is not desirable to meet an old friend retaining all the form &amp; external of the
                    person you loved yet inwardly so changed. But his death gave me a shock, for he was a man whom it is impossible to

                    has changed – not I. I look the same way in the afternoon that I did in the morning – but sunset &amp; sunrise make a different
                    scene. If I regret any thing in my own life it is that I <hi rend="ital">could</hi> not take orders, for of all ways of life, that
                    would have best accorded with my nature – but I could not get in at the door. Now – without being in communion with any particular
                    church or sect – I believe in Christ Jesus as the true teacher, &amp; derive my best hopes from that belief. It will be however
                    necessary for me, for <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">my daughters</ref> sake to join some church – &amp; that will be
                    the established one, – I like every thing belonging to it except its articles.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors"> In the

                    in any way whatever is an animal pleasure with me, &amp; the louder it is the better. Do you remember the round hole at the top of

                    destined to pass some years in Portugal, which indeed is my wish, – or if otherwise must ultimately remove to the neighbourhood of
                    London, for the sake of public libraries. </p><p rend="indent1"> – My dislike was not to schoolmasters – but to the Rod – which I dare warrant you do not make much use of. – Here
