                    been for a suspicion produced by your last letter that you expect me in London sooner than it is any ways possible for me to be
                    there &amp; that peradventure therefore you may think it is not worth while to look after my pension till I arrive in proper
                    person to receive it. Now M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bedford touching this matter there are two things to be said. My going to London
                    seems to me no very certain thing, – it depends something on <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle’s</ref> movements
                    of whose arrival from Lisbon I daily expect to hear, &amp; of course if I go, my journey must be so timed as to meet him. It
                    depends also something on my finances; &amp; I begin to think I cannot afford the expence of the journey, for I have had
                    extraordinary goings-out this year in settling myself, &amp; no extraordinary comings-in to counterbalance them. The Constable is
                    a leaden-heeled rascal, &amp; if I do not take care will be left confoundedly behind. I must work like a negro the whole winter to
                    set things right, &amp; the nearer the time for my projected journey approaches the less likely is it that I can spare it. My
                    object in going would be to consult certain books for the preliminaries &amp; notes to the Cid:<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey’s <title>Chronicle of the Cid, from the Spanish</title> was published by Longmans in 1808. It
                        comprised translations from the <title>Crónica particular del Cid</title> (1593), with additions from the <title>Crónica de
                            España</title> of Alphonso the Wise (1541) and <title>Romancero e Historia del Cid</title> (1632). Southey had thought of
                        visiting the library of Spanish books assembled by <ref target="people.html#FoxHenryRichard">Henry Richard Vassall-Fox</ref>
                        at his seat, <ref target="places.html#HollandHouse">Holland House</ref>, and the British Museum; see Southey to Grosvenor
                        Charles Bedford, 24 October 1807, Letter 1373.</note> &amp; these books I should assuredly feel myself bound to consult if it
                    required no other sacrifices than those of time &amp; trouble. But if the necessary expence cannot prudently &amp; justifiably be
                    afforded I must be content to do the best I can, – which will be quite well enough to satisfy every body except myself. </p><p rend="indent1"> In the second place if you can by any interest get my pension paid I pray you exert it. I foresee that I shall be
                    kept in hot water by it till I am lucky enough to get some little prize in the lottery of life which will enable me to wait
                    without inconvenience for arrears. – At present the only chance for this is in the sale of Espriella, – should that go thro two or
                    three editions, it will set me fairly afloat.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Letters from England by Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella. Translated from the Spanish</title> (1807). The book went into a
                        second edition in 1808; but a third was not called for until 1814.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> I thought to have brought up my lea way by doing a specific piece of jobwork, of which I have been rather
                    unhandsomely disappointed<del>xx</del>. The story is simply this: Smirke has projected a splendid edition of D Quixote with <ref target="people.html#CadellThomas">Cadell</ref> &amp; Davies. They proposed to <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> to take a share in it, &amp; he was authorized by them to ask me to translate it. While I was corresponding
                    with them upon the fitness of revising the first translation in preference, &amp; forming such a plan for preliminaries &amp;
                    annotations as would have made a great body of Spanish learning, – <ref target="people.html#CadellThomas">Cadell</ref> &amp;
                    Davies unknown to them struck a bargain with a Mr Balfour, – who is no more <del>fit to</del> able to translate D Quixote than he
                    would have been to write it.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The projected edition with plates by Robert Smirke
                        (1752–1845) appeared as <title>Don Quixote de la Mancha. Translated from the Spanish by Mary Smirke, Embellished with
                            Engravings</title>, 4 vols (London: Cadell and Davies, 1818). John Balfour (dates unknown), author of <title>Fables on
                            Subjects connected with Literature; imitated from the Spanish of Don Tomas Yriarte</title> (1804) was not the
                        translator.</note> This is some disappointment to me, as I should have &lt;been&gt; paid a specific sum for my work, &amp;
                    could have calculated upon it. The Longmen behave as they ought to do in the business. They refuse to take any share in the work
                    in consequence of this unhandsome dealing towards me, – &amp; offer to publish my edition upon our ordinary terms of halving the
                    profits. This however, would not serve my purpose.</p><p rend="indent1"> My affairs are not in a bad train except for the present. The profits of the current edition of Espriella, &amp; of
                    the unborn one of the Cid are anticipated &amp; gone. Those of the Specimens, of the small edition of Madoc, &amp; of Palmerin are
                        untouched.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Specimens of the Later English Poets</title> (1807), the second, duodecimo edition of <title>Madoc</title> (1807) and

                        (1807).</note> But if the three send me in 100 £ at the end of the years sale it will be more than I expect. The first volume
                    of Brazil will be ready for the press next summer<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The first volume of Southey’s
                            <title>History of Brazil</title> was published in 1810.</note> – I think also of publishing my travels in Portugal, for
                    which good materials have long lain by me<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey published an expanded edition of his
                            <title>Letters Written During a Short Residence in Spain and Portugal</title> (1797; 2nd edn 1798) in 1808 as

                    the year. – In my conscience I do not think any body else does so much &amp; gets so little for it. Have I told you that my whole
                    profits upon Madoc up to Midsummer last amount to <del>xxx</del> 25 £. &amp; the whole it is likely to be, unless the remaining
                    134 copies be sold as waste paper. </p><p rend="indent1"> I shall do, yet, – &amp; if there be any thing like a dispirited tone in this letter it is more because my eyes are
                    weak than for any other cause. It is likely that Espriella will bear me out, – I must be more than commonly unlucky if it does
                    not; &amp; if <del>that be the case I will</del> it does not, I will seek more review employment, write in more magazines &amp;
                    scribble verses for the newspaper. As long as I can keep half my time for labour worthy of myself &amp; of posterity, I shall not
                    feel <del>xxxxxx</del> debased by sacrificing the other however unworthily it may be employed. – You will say why do you not write
                    for the stage? – the <del>notion for</del> temptations to it are so strong, &amp; I have made the resolution so often, that not to
                    have done it yet is good proof of <del>xxx</del> a self conviction that it would not be done well. Besides I have not leisure from
                    present urgencies. </p><p rend="indent1"> Now do not fancy me bent double like the Pilgrim under this load upon my back. I am as bolt upright as ever, &amp;
                    in as wholesome good spirits; &amp; as soon as this letter is folded &amp; sent off, shall go on with reviewing Buchanans Travels,
