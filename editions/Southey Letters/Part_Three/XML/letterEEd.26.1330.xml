                    Review than for an Annual one. There are many articles which are valued precisely in proportion to the time and labour bestowed
                    upon them, and which therefore can be accurately fixed accordingly; these articles are not of that description. The worst
                    reviewals you have ever had from me have cost me more time and labour than the best. When the subject is good, and I am acquainted
                    with it, the pen flows freely; otherwise it is tilling an ungrateful soil. I can promise you a better review of Clavigero<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Francisco Javier Clavijero (1731–1787), <title>Storia antica del Messico</title>
