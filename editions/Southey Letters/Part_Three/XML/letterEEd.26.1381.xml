            <p rend="indent1"> About my projected journey, – it cannot take place so soon as you wish &amp; as I should wish also &amp; for two or
               three reasons. <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">My Uncle</ref> is in this Lisbon convoy which has been on the seas
               five weeks struggling with these dreadful winds. Heaven knows what is become of it – I look daily &amp; anxiously for news, &amp; hope
               it has been able to put into Cork. Something my movements must depend upon his. – You were right in remembering that I had renounced
               reviewing. <ref type="m" target="people.html#AikinArthur">Arthur Aikin</ref> however chose to forget this, &amp; has loaded down books
               upon me, which I should have returned, – if it had not unluckily been convenient to retain them for the purpose of making an item on
               the right side of <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmans</ref> ledger. I am about them now, – there is nothing which
               I do so with so little satisfaction, &amp; therefore <del>xxxxx xxxxxxxx</del> it is of all work the slowest. – These must be done
               before I can stir, – &amp; then – I must settle pros &amp; cons in my own mind whether it be absolutely necessary that I should take
               the journey at all. Certain it is that I should collect much matter both for the introduction &amp; notes to my forth-coming quarto, –
               but the materials already at hand are more than room can be found for; – &amp; I weigh the misery of travelling, the expence, &amp; the
               loss of time, – &amp; find little to set against them except the pleasure of seeing my friends. By the time the campaign of reviewing
               is done I shall better be able to determine. <del>xx</del>
