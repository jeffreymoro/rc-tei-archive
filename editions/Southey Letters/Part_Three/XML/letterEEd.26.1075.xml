                    complaints of N Easters &amp; sore eyes. If indeed you wanted a question of Spanish law in the thirteenth century decided, – or
                    any news of the first siege of Dio,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Siege of Diu in Gujurat, India (1509) occurred
                        when a combined fleet of Turkey, Egypt, Venice, the Republic of Ragusa (now known as Dubrovnik) and the Sultan of Gujarat,
                        Mahmud Begada (reigned 1458–1511), attempted to capture the city, then held by the Portuguese. The attempt failed.</note> I
                    could supply you with excellent information, – but for all that relates to the present race of men, I have never any thing to
                    communicate except of Egomet ipse, I byself I.</p><p rend="indent1"> The main news concerning that personage is this. My brother has taken some prizes which he expects will yield him a
                    thousand pounds. by great &lt;good&gt; fortune they were sent into St Vincents &amp; so escaped the Rochefort squadron.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> It was customary for naval officers to be allotted a share of the value of ships and cargo
                        captured in armed conflict, and Southey was concerned that <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Thomas</ref> would lose his
                        prize money from Spanish ships taken by HMS <hi rend="ital">Amelia</hi> in December 1804. His fears were exacerbated by the
                        fact that in mid-1805 a squadron of French ships commanded by Contre-Admiral Zacharie Allemand (1762–1828) and based at
                        Rochefort, slipped past the British blockade to harass British ships in the Atlantic and West Indies.</note> Now as soon as
                    he remits this sum for me to dispose of, it is my intention to borrow 350£ of it, for the purpose of removing &amp; furnishing a
                    house near London. So that if no unlucky accident turn up I may reasonably expect to get my books together &amp; feel settled
                    before the winter is over.</p><p rend="indent1"> Madoc is doing well. <del>x</del> rather more than half the edition are sold, which is much for so heavy a
                        volume.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Madoc</title> (1805) was published as a quarto edition, costing 2 guineas.</note> The sale will of course flag now,
                    till the world shall have <hi rend="ital">settled</hi> what they please to think of the poem. – &amp; if the reviews favour it the
                    remainder will be in a fair way. In fact books are now so dear that they are becoming rather articles of fashionable furniture
                    than any thing else. they who buy them do not read them, &amp; they who read them do not buy them. I have seen a Wiltshire
                    clothier who gives his bookseller no other instructions than the dimensions of his shelves – &amp; have just heard of a Liverpool
                    merchant who is fitting up a library, &amp; has told his bibliopole to send him Shakespere &amp; Milton &amp; Pope, &amp; if any
                    of those fellows should publish any thing new to let him have it immediately. – If Madoc obtain any celebrity its size &amp; cost
                    will recommend it among these gentry – <hi rend="ital">libros</hi> consumere nati, – born to buy quartos &amp; help the
                    revenue.</p><p rend="indent1"> Do you know if <ref target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</ref> had a copy sent him? I wish to know if he has
                    received it, – but do not wish him to think that I looked for any letter of matter-of-course compliment in acknowledgement.</p><p rend="indent1"> You were right in your suspicious dislike of the introductory lines. The Ille Ego is thought arrogant,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Meaning ‘I the man’, Southey is referring to the exordium to <title>Madoc</title>, published as:

                    It is saying no more in fact than if I had said Author of <hi rend="ital">so</hi> &amp; so in the title page, – &amp; moreover it
                    is not amiss that critics who will find fault with something should have these straws to catch at. I learn this from <ref target="people.html#SharpRichard">Sharp</ref> – whom <ref target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</ref> knows – who brings
                    me very favourable reports of its general effect, which is – he says, far greater than I could have supposed.</p><p rend="indent1"><ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Dapple</ref> gets on well with the Specimens,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey’s and Bedford’s jointly-edited anthology, <title>Specimens of the Later English Poets</title>
                        (1807).</note> except that he does not correct the press well. I have given him a hint of this &amp; trust he will profit by
                        <del>xx</del> it. <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref> tells me that by your help <ref target="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</ref> has got an appointment at the Museum. If he has apartments also, this
                    may be of use to me inasmuch as it would be pleasanter to work by his fire than in a cold reading room.</p><p rend="indent1"><ref target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</ref> has sent me his last volume<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> The fourth
                        volume of Sharon Turner’s <title>History of the Anglo-Saxons</title> (1799–1805).</note> but it has not yet reached me. I
                    shall urge him to add to what he has already done a history of Wales, which with <ref target="people.html#PugheWilliamOwen">Owens</ref> help he could do thoroughly.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Turner wrote instead a <title>History of

                    Academy. Sharp has had much to do with the establishment, – &amp; perhaps remotely I may have had something, having conversed last
                    year with him upon the necessity of some association for publishing such extensive national works as booksellers will not
                    undertake &amp; individuals cannot. Such as the Scriptores Rer. Britan. <note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Rerum Britannicarum Medii Aevi Scriptores: Or, Chronicles and Memorials of Great Britain and Ireland during the Middle
                            Ages</title> was eventually published under government auspices in a series of volumes from 1858–1964.</note> – Saxon

                    Belles Lettres. Some such application will perhaps be made to me one day or other. Indeed a hint to that effect was given me from
                    the Royal Institution<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Royal Institution was founded in March 1799.</note> last year.
                    My mind is made up to reject any such invitation, because I have neither the requisites nor the wish to be a public orator, –
                    because I can make myself known enough without any such act. – &amp; lastly because it is &lt;not&gt; impossible that better
                    things may one day be within my reach, to which it might perhaps be rather an obstacle than otherwise. – On removing to London I
                    shall take once more the plan of the Bibliotheca into consideration, &amp; calculate whether or no it be advisable to drop all

                    probably be my last year of reviewing, – the time which one years portion of such work occupies would be enough to translate a
