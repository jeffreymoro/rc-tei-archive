<p rend="indent1"> Had I my dear <ref target="people.html#CollinsCharles">Collins</ref> the pen of Rousseau I would attempt to describe the various
                    scenes which have presented themselves to me &amp; the various emotions
                    occasioned by them. that pen which instead of being pointed with fire was dipt
                    in the milk of human kindness &amp; knew so well to describe all the joys
                    &amp; agonies of sensibility was equal to any task — but enough of this
                    fill-paper style. it deserves no better epithet — instead of Rousseau believe me
                    plain democratic RS &amp; be content with a little prose as unadorned
                    &amp; unpolished as myself. on Wednesday morning about eight o clock we
                    sallied forth. my travelling equipage consisting of my diary — writing book, pen
                    &amp; ink silk handkerchief &amp; Miltons defence.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">John Milton (1608–1674; <title level="m">DNB</title>), <title level="m">Pro Populo Anglicano Defensio</title>
                        (1651).</note> we reached Woodstock to breakfast where I was delighted with
                    reading the Nottingham address for peace.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Possibly an address to the mayor of Nottingham in 1793 by 26 local
                        gentlemen, urging the corporation to petition for peace and reform.</note>
                    perhaps you will call it stupidity which made me pass the very walls of Blenheim
                    without turning from the road to behold the Ducal palace — perhaps it was so —
                    but it was the stupidity of a democratic philosopher who had appointed a day in
                    summer for the purpose — who was in haste to proceed &amp; who only lamented
                    the waste of building lavished upon a Duke<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, (1650–1722; <title level="m">DNB</title>). The building of Blenheim Palace had been
                        financed by the public purse in gratitude for his victory at the battle of
                        Blenheim in 1704.</note> — from thence to Enstone where curiosity tempted me
                    to Henriettas water works.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">A grotto and
                        fountains erected by Thomas Bushell (bef. 1600–1674; <title level="m">DNB</title>) on his estate at Enstone, Oxfordshire. Charles I
                        (1600–1649; reigned 1625–1649; <title level="m">DNB</title>) and his wife
                        Henrietta Maria (1609–1669; <title level="m">DNB</title>) visited them in
                        1636.</note> the good old woman was kind enough not to surprise me by
                    wetting me all over but I learnt that the great amusement consists in getting
                    women there &amp; streaming up water from the ground. the maker must have
                    been some fool who had more money than wit &amp; more wit than charity for
                    half the expence would have fed the hungry &amp; cloathed the naked. we
                    dined at Chipping Norton &amp; slept at Morton. 27 miles from the celebrated
                    seat of wigs &amp; debauchery. this is journey writing &amp; only wastes
                    paper let me hurry over the remainder for I have a most delightful history.
                    Evesham Abbey detained me some time. it was here where Edward defeated &amp;
                    slew Simon de Montford.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The battle of
                        Evesham 1265, saw the defeat of Simon de Montfort (c. 1208–1265; <title level="m">DNB</title>), leader of the barons, by Prince Edward (later
                        Edward I) (1239–1307; reigned 1272–1307; <title level="m">DNB</title>).</note> often did I wish for you &amp; your pencil for
                    never did I behold so beautiful a pile of ruins. I have seen the abbeys at
                    Battle &amp; Malmsbury — but this is a compleat specimen of the simple
                    Gothic. a tower quite compleat fronts the church whose roof is dropping down
                    &amp; admits thro the chasms the dim-streaming light — the high pointed
                    window frames where the high grass waves to the lonely breeze &amp; that
                    beautiful moss which at once ornaments &amp; cankers the monastic pile rapt
                    me to other years — I recalled the savage sons of superstition — I heard the
                    deep toned mass &amp; the chaunted prayer for those who fell in fight. but
                    fancy soon recurred to a more enchanting scene — the blind beggar of Bethnal
                    green &amp; his daughter<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The
                        ‘Beggar’s Daughter of Bednall Green’ was an Elizabethan ballad, included in
                        Thomas Percy (1729–1811; <title level="m">DNB</title>), <title level="m">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</title>, 2nd edn, 3 vols (London,
                        1767) II, pp. 160–166. The ‘Beggar’ was an old soldier who had lost his
                        sight at the battle of Evesham. His daughter’s suitors rejected her because
                        of her poverty, but when her true love proposed to her it was revealed the
                        ‘Beggar’ was really Henry de Montfort, son of Simon de Montfort. The real
                        Henry de Montfort (1238–1265; <title level="m">DNB</title>) died at
                        Evesham.</note> — you know how intimately connected with this now mouldering
                    scene that ballad is. over this abbey I could detain you Collins for ever so
                    many &amp; so various were the reveries it caused. we reached Worcester to
                    dinner the second day. 56 miles from Oxford — there <ref target="people.html#CollinsCharles">Collins</ref> when shall we walk so
                    philosophically? the next morning we breakfasted with a clergyman of the name of
                        Miller<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Possibly a clergyman at
                        Worcester, but otherwise unidentified.</note> at Worcester. from him I
                    learnt much of the Glasgow mode of education &amp; all I learnt but served
                    the more to disgust me with Oxonian stupidity. we reached the Hatthouse to
                    dinner twelve miles onwards. imagine a house built in that stile which excluding
                    fantastic ornament seeks only convenience — half way up what you would call a
                    steep hill — at the bottom such a rivulet! rushing in natural cascades over huge
                    stones gleaming with moss. the banks overspread with primroses &amp;
                    redolent of the violets that just appeared amid the moss around — I am not equal
                    to the description — but I sit upon the broken rocks &amp; los[MS blotted]
                    myself in reveries — never without recurring to Rousseau &amp; the Elysium
                    of Madame Wolmar.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">In Jean-Jacques

<p rend="indent1"> we walked by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Butts<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">George Butt (1741–1795; <title level="m">DNB</title>), the
                        father of Southey’s schoolmate John Marten Butt. George Butt had worked as a
                        tutor in the household of Sir Edward Winnington (1749–1805), who in 1771 had
                        presented him to the rectory of Stanford (misspelt ‘Stamford’ by Southey)
                        and the vicarage of Clifton. In 1787, Butt was presented by Lord Foley to
                        the vicarage of Kidderminster, and was living there at the time Southey’s
                        letter was written. He returned to Stanford in 1794. One of the circle of

                    recollect about six months back an advertisement stating that Joseph Stinton had
                    forcibly taken Mary Severne from her governess &amp; cautioning the clergy
                    from marrying them. the story is this. they eloped together from her fathers at

                    there is no back door to that the man replied — &amp; Stinton was satisfied.
