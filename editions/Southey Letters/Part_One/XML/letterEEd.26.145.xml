<p rend="indent1"> Bedford — when I have a home, I will hang my Sans Culotte stick
                    upon the wall, &amp; remain there till I become the tenant of a narrower
                    habitation. the soul of a poor Jew let loose by the Inquisitorial fire, cannot
                    feel more exquisite delight when it arrives in Abrahams bosom than will be mine
                    if I ever set foot again upon English ground. were my heart cold or vacant I
                    should not feel thus, for this soil would do well enough to vegetate in; the
                    sole pleasure I have found in this country is in counting how many days before I
                    shall leave it. I crossed the Bay of Biscay in such tempestuous weather <del rend="strikethrough">xxxx xx</del> that for sixty hours I lay in momentary
                    dread of sinking. we have broken down upon the road three times &amp;
                    overturned once. the wind wrecked a Spanish vessel in the river at the time we
                    crossed it here — a passage of twelve miles at night. I was happy to tread upon
                    the ground at landing, for I thought myself upon Terra firma. before day break
                    there was an earthquake. earth air &amp; water have all contributed to annoy
                    me, &amp; God knows I suffered enough upon the road for want of the other
                    element. the bugs &amp; muskitoes were gone into winter quarters &amp; I
                    only suffered from a few stragglers — but every night upon the road was I
                    regularly <hi rend="ital">flead</hi>. we were eighteen days travelling to Madrid
                    &amp; 15 from thence to Lisbon. I walked the greater part of the way by
                    which means I kept myself warm &amp; escaped the overturn &amp; twice
                    breaking down. on Xmas day the following thoughts occurred — &amp; if the
                    lines do not possess much poetical merit, they will at least tell you what I
                    felt.</p>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent2">How many a heart is happy at this hour</l>
<l rend="indent2">In England! brightly oer the chearful hall</l>
<l rend="indent2">Beams the heapd hearth, &amp; friends &amp; kindred
                        meet,</l>

<l rend="indent2">Beholds her children seperated long</l>
<l rend="indent2">Amid the worlds wide way, assembled now.</l>
<l rend="indent2">And at the sight affection lightens up</l>
<l rend="indent2">With smiles the eye that Age has long bedimmd.</l>
<l rend="indent2">I do remember when I was a child</l>
<l rend="indent2">How my young heart, a stranger then to Care,</l>
<l rend="indent2">With transport leapd upon this holyday,</l>
<l rend="indent2">As oer the house all gay with evergreens</l>
<l rend="indent2">From friend to friend with eager speed I ran</l>
<l rend="indent2">And bade a merry Christmas to them all.</l>
<l rend="indent2">Those years are past — their pleasures &amp; their
                        pains</l>
<l rend="indent2">Are now like yonder convent-crested hill</l>
<l rend="indent2">That bounds the distant prospect, dimly seen,</l>
<l rend="indent2">Yet picturd upon Memorys mystic glass</l>
<l rend="indent2">In faint fair hues. A weary traveller now</l>
<l rend="indent2">I journey oer the desart mountain track</l>
<l rend="indent2">Of Leon: wilds all drear &amp; comfortless,</l>
<l rend="indent2">Where the grey lizards in the noontide sun</l>
<l rend="indent2">Sport on their rocks, &amp; where the Goatherd starts</l>
<l rend="indent2">Rousd from his midnight sleep, &amp; shakes to hear</l>
<l rend="indent2">The wolfs loud yell, &amp; falters as he calls</l>
<l rend="indent2">On Saints to save. hence of the friends I think</l>
<l rend="indent2">Who now perchance remember me, &amp; pour</l>
<l rend="indent2">The glass of votive friendship. at the name</l>
<l rend="indent2">Will not thy cheek <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Beloved</ref>! wear the hue</l>
<l rend="indent2">Of Love, &amp; in mine <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Ediths</ref> eye the tear</l>
<l rend="indent2">Tremble? I will not wish thee not to weep —</l>
<l rend="indent2">There is strange pleasure in Affections tears —</l>
<l rend="indent2">And he who knows not what it is to wake</l>
<l rend="indent2">And weep at midnight, is an instrument</l>
<l rend="indent2">Of Natures common work, whose ill-tuned nerves</l>
<l rend="indent2">Can never vibrate to the softer touch</l>
<l rend="indent2">That wakes the Joy of Grief. yes — think of me</l>
<l rend="indent2">My <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref>! think
                        that, travelling far away,</l>
<l rend="indent2">I do beguile the long &amp; lonely hours</l>

                        famed for his wealth and extravagance. Elected MP for Wells in 1784, he was
                        on the verge of obtaining a peerage when his reputation was destroyed by the
                        scandal surrounding his relationship with William Courtenay, heir to the
                        Earl of Devon. Beckford left England for Europe in 1785, and between
                        1793–1796, he lived mainly at Cintra, Portugal. He and Southey did not meet

                    &amp; pestered the servants with his care of them. passing by them one day
                    he heard his maid servant cry — “curse the whelps — one would think they were my
