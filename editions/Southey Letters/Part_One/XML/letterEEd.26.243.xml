<salute>My dear Grosvenor</salute>

<p rend="indent2">		I like the plan you propose, &amp; see no objection to it at present. but you know how feasable those things appear which we wish. one circumstance only may happen to prevent it — I have some hopes that my mother will come &amp; live with me. this I very earnestly wish &amp; shall use every means to induce her, but it does not appear so probable as I could desire. this I shall know in a short time — &amp; if then you have not changed your intentions — you know how gladly I should domesticate under the same roof with you. in that case I should certainly prefer keeping a servant for various oeconomical reasons.</p>
<p rend="indent1">	I think you would derive more good from Epictetus<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The Stoic philosopher Epictetus (c. AD 60–after 100), author of the <title level="m">Encheiridion</title>.</note> than from studying yourself. there is a very proud independance in the Stoic philosophy which has always much pleased me; you would find certain sentences in the Enchiridion which would occur to the mind when such maxims were wanted &amp; operate as motives. besides when you are examining yourself you ought to have a certain standard by which to measure yourself: &amp; however far an old Stoic may be from perfection, he is almost a God when compared to the present race who libel that nature which appeared with such exceeding lustre in Athens in Lacedæmon &amp; in Rome. I could send you to a better system than that of the bondsman Epictetus, where you would find a better model on which to form your conduct. but the mind should have arrived at a certain stage to profit properly by that book, which few have attained. it should be cool &amp; confirmed.</p>
<p rend="indent1">	As for the Law I am less surprized at your laying it down than at your taking it up. with your prospect of independance I think your leisure could scarcely be worse employed than in learning that which you would only wish to remember in your profession. for myself I think I know Blackstone<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">William Blackstone (1723–1780; <title level="m">DNB</title>), legal writer and judge, author of <title level="m">Commentaries on the Laws of England</title> (1765–1769).</note> well now — &amp; shall get on well. but if Buonaparte should come how many fine schemes he will spoil!</p>
<p rend="indent1">	I write now in haste. my time is fully employed &amp; I must walk into town, on an errand already too long delayed.</p>
<p rend="indent1">	Are the Hendersons<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Friends of the Bedfords.</note> at Lymington? I should like to see the younger one again. I like her.</p>
<p rend="indent1">	To recur again to the first part of this letter. I have many acquaintance strangers to you. many worth your knowing — some not — these last meet only with mere civility from me. how far their occasional calls would be disagreable to you — you best know.</p>
