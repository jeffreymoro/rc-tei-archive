     <p rend="indent1">If the scheme for uniting Spain &#38; Portugal should take effect, it is more likely to be under a republican than a kingly government. Such a termination I thought likely at the commencement of their troubles fourteen years ago,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Edinburgh Annual Register for 1808</title>, 1.1 (1810), 390.</note> &#38; thought it also the consummation to be wished looking both upon the Bourbon &#38; Braganzan races<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The Bourbons had been the ruling dynasty in Spain since 1700 and the Braganzas had ruled Portugal since 1640.</note> as effete; thinking that such <del>an xxxx</del> &#60; a connection&#62; required no sacrifice of feeling on the part of Portugal, &#38; that when the general government of Spain was dissolved, a federal <del>connection</del> union of its respective kingdoms each retaining or modifying its own <hi rend="ital">fueros</hi>,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The varying codes of laws and traditional privileges of the different regions of Spain.</note> was the system into which they would most easily &#38; naturally fall. The aspects in Europe have so changed since that time &#38; the republican spirit which was then trampled under foot in France is now so rampant every where, that I should be sorry to see the course of events tending to that issue – tho if the peninsular alone were concerned, it is perhaps that which might bring its successes <del>xx</del> soonest to an end. Eroles<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Joaquin Ibanez Cuevas y de Valonga, Baron de Eroles (1784–1825), Spanish commander during the Peninsular War. He opposed the liberal regime and supported the French invasion of 1823.</note> might oppose a Braganzan king of Spain upon the same priniciple that he opposed Joseph Buonaparte<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph Bonaparte (1768–1844; King of Spain 1808–1813).</note> – but the same feeling might not induce him to oppose a total change of government, which added Portugal to Spain &#38; restored to his own principality<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Catalonia, which was a principality of the Aragonese crown after 1137.</note> all its proud old privileges. I think if I were a Spaniard or Portugueze that this would be my aim. But as an Englishman, &#38; regarding the question as it would affect the whole of Europe (where the tendency is certainly down the hill of democracy) I should grieve to see it.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">    My brother <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henry</ref> who sees a good deal of the Portugueze in London, knows more of their views &#38; politics than I do. They have in Joam 6.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">John VI (1767–1826; King of Portugal 1816–1826).</note> an easy man of good faith, whom they can govern, &#38; whom they can trust. Ferdinand<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Ferdinand VII (1784–1833; King of Spain 1808, 1813–1833). In 1820–1823 he was virtually a prisoner under the liberal regime.</note> is truly a wretch, unworthy of compassion even in his present miserable condition. I wish he had no brothers, for in that case I should heartily assent to the fitness of shutting him up a convent &#38; giving the K of Portugal the crown in right of his wife.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles, Count of Molina (1788–1855) and Francis, Duke of Cadiz (1794–1865). Their eldest sister, Charlotte (1775–1830), was married to John VI of Portugal.</note></p>
        <p rend="indent1">    By us at least they must be left to themselves, &#38; I hope France will not interfere.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">France invaded Spain on 7 April 1823 and defeated the liberal regime, restoring Ferdinand VII’s absolute authority.</note> Such intereference may be deeply injurious, in more ways than one, suppose it were successful – Ferdinand would then hold his authority only by the support of France, &#38; the evil which you apprehend <del>would</del> that of Spains becoming in effect a province of France would at once be brought about. On the other if a formidable <del>xxx</del> resistance were made by the aid of Portugal, the republican party would thereby acquire the power of effecting their designs, – &#38; when that train is fired – who can tell how far the explosion will reach? The Portugueze have an efficient army with British officers they would beat the French – without them I think they would have a fair chance.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">The Portuguese Army had been reorganised under British control in 1808–1814, though most British officers had left the force by 1820.</note> But they would obtain adventurers from England as easily as the S. Americans have done. And however much the French King<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Louis XVIII (1755–1824; King of France 1814–1824).</note> may wish to rid himself of disaffected troops, he had better keep them in France, &#38; take his chance for fifty such conspiracies as Bertins<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably a mistake by Southey: Louis-François Bertin (1766–1841) was a well-known French journalist, but a convinced royalist. Southey probably intended to refer to Jean-Baptiste Breton (1769–1822), a French general who headed an unsuccessful military revolt against the royalist regime on 24 February 1822. He was executed on 5 October 1822.</note> than engage in another peninsular war.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">   I have not seen the Liberal,<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">Byron’s <title>The Vision of Judgment</title> (1822), a parody of Southey’s <title>A Vision of Judgement </title>(1821), was first published in the <title>Liberal</title>, 1 (October 1822), 3–39.</note> but a Leeds paper<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>Leeds Intelligencer and Yorkshire General Advertiser</title>, 21 October 1822.</note> has been sent me containing an account of it, &#38; including among its extracts the description &#38; behaviour of a certain “varlet”.<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Vision of Judgment</title> (1822), stanza 94, line 1: ‘The varlet [Southey] was not an ill-favour’d knave’.</note> <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">He</ref> has certainly not offended me in the way that the pious Painter exasperated the Devil. – <note n="17" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s ‘The Pious Painter: a Catholic Story’, <title>Morning Post</title>, 2 November 1798, in which the Devil is annoyed by the painter’s accurate depiction of him.</note> As for the slander, – <note n="18" place="foot" resp="editors">Byron accused Southey of changing his opinions, dullness, prolixity and writing to order. He also referred to the pantisocratic scheme that Southey and Coleridge formed in 1794 as ‘less moral than ‘twas clever’ (<title>The Vision of Judgment</title> (1822), stanza 97, line 6), implying that the pantisocrats wished to engage in free love. The whole poem took a satirical view of the divine judgment on the deceased George III (1738–1820; King of Great Britain 1760–1820; <title>DNB</title>), in opposition to Southey’s serious treatment in <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821).</note> it is not worth an angry feeling, &#38; <del>certainly</del> has not excited a painful or an uncomfortable one.

            <p rend="indent1">   I have been reviewing Gregoires Hist: des Sectes Religieuses,<note n="19" place="foot" resp="editors">Henri Grégoire (1750–1831), <title>Histoire des Sectes Religieuse, qui, Depuis de Commencement du Siecle Dernier Jusqu’a l’Epoque Actuelle, sont Nées, se sont Modifiées, se sont Éteintes dans le Quatre Parties du Monde</title> (1814), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 28 (October 1822), published 15 February 1823.

            <p rend="indent1">    Of late I have been chiefly &#60;employed&#62; upon <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrereBartholomew">Freres</ref> papers, &#38; have gone thro about half of them.

            <p rend="indent1">    To day I have received an importation of American books from <ref type="m" target="people.html#TicknorGeorge">Ticknor</ref>, the Professor of modern language at Harvard College, – one of the best informed men I ever became acquainted with.

Scott’s madwomen included Madge Wildfire in <title>The Heart of Midlothian</title> (1818) and the eponymous <title>Bride of Lammermoor</title> (1819).</note> curious as a picture of manners &#38; in itself very much above mediocrity, but sadly injured by the introduction of a crazy woman in imitation of <ref type="m" target="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scotts</ref> novels.</p>
