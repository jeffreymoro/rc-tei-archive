            <p rend="indent1"> Your letter was as welcome as this days rain when the thirsty ground was gaping for it. Indeed I should have been uneasy at your silence, &#38; apprehended that some untoward cause must have occasioned it, if I had not heard from <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</ref> that you had supplied her Exchequer. </p>
            <p rend="indent1">  I should indeed have enjoyed the sight of <ref type="m" target="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppa</ref> in the condition which you describe &#38; the subsequent process of transformation.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Bedford had written to Southey on 16 April 1824, describing how Duppa had arrived at his house caked in mud after being splashed by a passing coach. Bedford had provided Duppa with an ill-assorted selection of his own and his brother, Henry Bedford’s, clothes. This allowed Duppa to attend a nearby dinner party.</note> How well I can call to mind his appearance on his return from the Theatre one &#38; thirty years ago!<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Duppa had visited Southey in Oxford to attend the installation of William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland (1738–1809; <title>DNB</title>; Prime Minister 1783, 1807–1809) as Chancellor of the University of Oxford, on 1 July 1793. The ceremony had been held in the Sheldonian Theatre (built 1664–1669).</note> Little did I think that day that the next time I was to enter that Theatre would be in a red <del>dress</del> gown to be bedoctored &#38; called every thing <del>xxx</del> that ends in <hi rend="ital">issimus</hi>.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Civil Law at the University of Oxford on 14 June 1820. The ceremony was again in the Sheldonian Theatre.</note> And yet of the two days, the former was one of the most chearful in my life, &#38; the latter if not the most melancholy, I think the very loneliest.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> writes to me that he has put the Book of the Church<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> to press for a second edition. I make no alterations, except to correct two slips of the pen &#38; the press – when the Emperor Charles 5 is called Q. Catharines brother instead of her nephew<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Book of the Church</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), II, p. 8, where Charles V (1500–1558; Holy Roman Emperor 1519–1556, King of Spain 1516–1556) was misidentified as the brother, rather than the nephew, of Catherine of Aragon (1485–1536; <title>DNB</title>), first wife of Henry VIII (1491–1547; King of England 1509–1547; <title>DNB</title>).</note> &#38; Henry IV printed for III.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Book of the Church</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), II, p. 341, where Henry IV (1553–1610; King of France 1589–1610) was misprinted for Henry III (1551–1589; King of France 1574–1589).</note> – &#38; to omit an anecdote about Gardiners death which <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> tells me has been disproved by Lingard.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 6 February 1824, contained a letter from ‘TRUTH’, provoked by the first edition of Southey’s <title>Book of the Church</title> (1824). It pointed out that Southey’s account of the death of Stephen Gardiner (1483–1555; <title>DNB</title>), Bishop of Winchester 1531–1551, 1553–1555, in <title>Book of the Church</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), II, pp. 209–210, could not be accurate and was contradicted by John Lingard (1771–1851; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The History of England, from the First Invasion of the Romans</title>, 5 vols (London, 1819–1823), V, p. 628. Southey only possessed the first three volumes of the latter, published in 1819, no. 1634 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note> I do not know what number <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> printed. But if there should appear a probability of its obtaining a regular sale, in that case I shall be disposed to think seriously of composing a similar view of our civil history, &#38; calling it the Book of the State,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey did not write this work.</note> with the view of showing how the course of political events has influenced the condition of society, &#38; tracing the growth &#38; effect of our institutions, the gradual <del>decay of</del> disappearances of some evils &#38; the rise of others. Meantime however I have enough upon my hands – &#38; still more in my head.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> Hudson Gurney<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Hudson Gurney (1775–1864; <title>DNB</title>), an antiquarian and poet from a prominent Quaker family in Norwich. Gurney was a Whig MP for Shaftesbury 1812–1813, and Newtown, Isle of Wight 1816–1832.</note> said to me he wished <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the King</ref> would lay his commands on me to write the history of his Fathers reign.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">George III (1738–1820; King of Great Britain 1760–1820; <title>DNB</title>). Southey did not write a history of his reign.</note> I wish he would – provided he would make my pension a clear 500 £ a year,<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">i.e. £500 after tax. Southey’s pension, paid since 1807, was only £200 per annum, which was reduced to about £144 per annum after tax. </note> to support me while I was writing it. And then I think I could <del>xx</del> treat the subject with some credit to myself.</p>

The form of the work is that of President Henault’s Abr.

He was President of the Chamber of Enquiries of the Parlement of Paris 1710–1731.</note>– which is the only form adapted to that particular subject – the sole thread being that of chronology. The plan includes the whole of the West India Islands.</p>
