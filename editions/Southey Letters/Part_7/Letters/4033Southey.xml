<salute>Dear Sir</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">Accept my thanks for your volume of Sermons,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Swan, <title>Sermons on Several Subjects; with Notes, Critical, Historical and Explanatory</title> (1823).</note> &#38; the obliging note accompanying it, which I have this day received. Tho I have as yet done little more than glance at the pages as I cut them open, I perceive that the manner is, as it ought to be, attractive, &#38; likely to be remembered as well as attended to. Dull &#38; vapid sermons are worse than unprofitable; they act as narcotics upon the devotional feelings, &#38; this in no trifling degree counteract the purport of social worship. On the other hand there is no situation from which a man with lively feelings &#38; a well stored mind can enforce sound principles with so much effect as from the pulpit. You will I hope continue so to do, both to the public advantage &#38; your own</p>
