            <salute>My dear Harry</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">Thank you for your arrangement concerning the Herald.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had received a free copy of the daily evening newspaper, the <title>Courier</title>, because of Daniel Stuart’s association with the paper. Once Stuart sold his remaining shares in 1824 this arrangement ceased. Southey switched to the <title>Morning Herald</title> (1780–1869), a daily newspaper which at this time was non-aligned between Whigs and Tories. Its editorials were famously short – half a column.</note> The paper pleases me better than any other Morning Paper, <del>whxx</del> tho it scarcely ever manifests an opinion which I do not disapprove. But it keeps within decent bounds, &#38; the leading paragraph as it is the worst part, has generally the merit of being the most insignificant</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> My cold made its appearance as usual with the first fine weather, &#38; I <del>x</del> soon felt the effect of the relaxation which it produced. <del>Last week I went</del> &#60;About&#62; a fortnight ago I went up Skiddaw with <ref type="m" target="people.html#HughesThomas">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> </ref> &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#HughesMaryAnne">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Hughes</ref> &#38; was the better for it, but two days after we went with them by way of Watenlath into Borrodale, &#38; tho I carted it for nine miles out of the fourteen, the walk brought on a considerable haemorrhage;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey suffered from a rectal prolapse and haemorrhoids.</note> – &#38; the next day the cold became so violent that for a whole week I spent the greater part of the day upon the sofa in a darkened room, unable to bear the light. It has got into my chest, at first with great violence; – now it is quiet there, &#38; I hope that as it has made a quicker passage than usual, it will depart the sooner. To day I am so much better that I have had no occasion to intermit my employments: something I attribute to change of weather, yesterday when the amendment began the first rain falling which we have had for eight or ten weeks.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> It appears now beyond all doubt that the books for which I have so long waited &#38; made so many enquiries are not in existence, &#38; that the account of them &#38; their author in Colburnes Magazine must consequently be a mere fiction.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had read John Mitford’s ‘On Spanish Literature, with some Account of Francisco de Olivarez’, <title>New Monthly Magazine</title>, 10 (October 1818), 221–223. It mentioned Olivarez’s <title>Account of the War in Catalonia</title>, published in four volumes at Seville in 1815; <title>Anecdotes of Chiefs Employed in the Catalan War</title> (1816); and <title>Memoirs of the Spanish Monarchy to the Abdication of Charles 4 &#38; the Usurpation of Joseph Bonaparte</title> (1816). However, none of these works seem to exist. Southey had already asked Murray to try and acquire them; see Southey to John Murray: 10 July 1820, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3509; 27 February 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3641; 11 June 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3693; and 27 July 1822, Letter 3877 and 1 November [1822], Letter 3911. Murray had then written to Spain to try and obtain these books for Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832), and Herbert Hill had also offered to help. Southey had then sought the assistance of George Canning. Finally, Southey had written to John Mitford, 12 April 1824, Letter 4171.</note> It was signed John Mitford. I know something of one <ref type="m" target="people.html#MitfordJohn">John Mitford</ref> &#38; supposing him to be the author, never doubted the authenticity of the account: – as indeed who would have suspected a fiction of this kind? – I have now sent the volume to press,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The second volume of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> &#38; am at this time as busy in arranging its materials as a General is in planning the operations of a campaign.

           <p rend="indent1"> I have notice of a few books from Boston – one of them is Cap<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Churchs account of Philips war,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Church (1674–1746), <title>The Entertaining History of King Philip’s War, Which Began in the Month of June in 1675.

Benjamin Church</title> (1772), no. 590 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library,</note> of all books the one which is of most direct importance for my poem, – &#38; perhaps the very rarest of all works relating to AngloAmerican history. Another is a very important one in the history of Quakerism.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Roger Williams (1603–1683), <title>George Fox Digged out of his Burrowes</title> (1676), no. 3122 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> – <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> lately sent me Spix &#38; Martins’s Travels in Brazil.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Johann Baptist von Spix (1781–1826) and Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius (1794–1868), <title>Reise in Brasilien auf Befehl Sr. Majestät Maximilian Joseph I.

           <p rend="indent1"> I have reviewed Hayleys Memoirs<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s review of John Johnson (1769–1833; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Memoirs of the Life and Writings of William Hayley, Esq. the Friend and Biographer of Cowper, Written by Himself; with Extracts from his Private Correspondence, and Unpublished Poetry; and Memoirs of his Son Thomas Alphonso Hayley, the Young Sculptor</title> (1823), no. 1179 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 31 (March 1825), 263–311.</note> – - Lambton I see has purchased Martins Picture.<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">John George Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham (1792–1840; <title>DNB</title>), bought John Martin (1789–1854; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Seventh Plague of Egypt</title> (1823) for 500 guineas. The painting had been included in the inaugural exhibition of the Society of British Artists (1824), where it was probably seen by Southey on his trip to London, November 1823–February 1824. </note> Whatever he may have given for it, it will be worth ten times that sum hereafter. I never saw any picture which imprest me with so high a notion of the painters genius.</p></postscript>
