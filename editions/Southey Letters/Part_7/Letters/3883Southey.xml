            <p rend="indent1">It was a great pleasure to us to receive your letter &#38; know that you had reached home safely, &#38; found all well. Now that you have made the journey I trust that you have discovered what an easy thing it is, &#38; that you will feel no disinclination to repeat it.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">The day after we parted, I breakfasted with <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthChristopher">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wordsworth</ref>, &#38; set forward on my return meaning to get into the coach when it should overtake me. <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">W.</ref> &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthChristopher">the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi></ref> walked with me to set me on the way (as the phrase is) &#38; we had got about three miles, when a slight rain came on &#38; sent them back. <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthChristopher">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> W.</ref> had been explaining the evil consequences of letting the gownsmen<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Cambridge undergraduates. Wordsworth persuaded Trinity College, Cambridge, to invest in a quadrangle called ‘The New Court’, opened in 1825, to allow more undergraduates to live in College.</note> lodge in the town, &#38; the measures which he was taking to put an end to so pernicious a practise. I wish you had present, inasmuch as what he said would have given you a very high idea of his good sense &#38; his talents for business. – By the time I reached the halfway house at Wytheburne<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Wythburn.</note> my clothes were so damp that it would have imprudent to have gone in &#38; waited for the coach. The rain then increased &#38; continued very heavy till I was within four miles of <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>, when it cleared up, &#38; I entered the town at the same minute as the coach. There I found <ref type="m" target="people.html#SharpRichard">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sharp</ref> &#38; the American ‘Randolph of Roanoke’<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">John Randolph (1773–1833), Virginia tobacco planter and Representative or Senator almost continuously for his State between 1799 and 1833.</note> who spent the evening with me. Thursday evening Sir John Malcolm<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir John Malcolm (1769–1833; <title>DNB</title>), the Scottish soldier, East India Company administrator and historian. He had effectively governed most of central India in 1818–1822, but had returned home disappointed not to receive further promotion.</note> made his appearance &#38; he &#38; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Duncan,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Duncan (1774–1846; <title>DNB</title>), Minister of Ruthwell, Dumfriesshire, who had founded the savings bank movement in 1810.</note> (a Scotch pastor <del>x</del> who is the founder of the Savings-Banks) breakfasted with me the next day. That day was fated to end most frightfully. <ref type="m" target="people.html#KennawayCharlesE">Charles Kennaway</ref>, who had drank tea here, went over to the Island with the girls &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Coleridge</ref>. – I had just finished my supper when Anne<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">A maid working for the Southey household.</note> came into the room as pale as death to say there had been a dreadful accident at the Island. a cannon had burst, – &#38; young M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Henry killed.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Edward Henry (1807–1833), the younger of Peachy’s two stepsons. The accident occurred on 2 August 1822 and was widely reported in the newspapers (without naming him): ‘A young gentleman, by way of saluting some friends who were taking their departure, fired off a cannon, which unfortunately burst in consequence of being overloaded, and the fragments severely fractured his skull’ (<title>Glasgow Herald</title>, 12 August 1822). The cannon was kept outside Peachy’s house on Derwent Island and was fired as part of the annual Keswick Regatta.</note> This was the first report, – the second was that some other person was hurt, – nor could we ascertain what had actually happened till I &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> S</ref> got to the water side, where we found a number of persons collected, waiting in perfect silence to know the extent of the mischief. A boat was coming across, &#38; to our infinite relief the girls (<ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Sara C.</ref> <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</ref> &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref>) were in it. Poor things, they had a sad story to tell, – in spite of their remonstrances Charles Henry would fire the cannon when they were coming away, – it had burst &#38; fractured his skull, – &#38; whether he would live or die they knew not. – Thank God, tho the fracture was a dreadful one (more than thirty pieces of the skull having been taken out – &#38; the brain itself injured in both lobes) he has been going on well, &#38; every hour strengthens the probability of his entire recovery, twelve<del>n</del> days having now elapsed. – You may conceive what a shock this has been to us.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#MayJohn">John May</ref> &#38; his son<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">John May and his son, John May (1802–1879), visited Southey at Keswick 5 August–2 September 1822.</note> did not arrive till Monday, – had they come on Saturday as was expected they would have found us in the greatest apprehension &#38; distress. Now that all <del>sxxx</del> is going on so much better than we could at first venture to hope, I have been again going over some of the ground which you &#38; I lately traversed with so much satisfaction. Saturday last we walked round the Lake, Monday up <ref type="m" target="places.html#Skiddaw">Skiddaw</ref>, ascending by the line which you descended, – yesterday to the Vale of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Johns, – today had the weather permitted we should have attempted Causey Pike. Exercise like this is of great benefit to me; &#38; you have done me a great deal of good by bringing me into good condition.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> <ref type="m" target="people.html#BellAndrew">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bell</ref> came on the same day with the Mays, they on the coach he in it. <ref type="m" target="people.html#FeldborgAndreas">Feldborg the Dane</ref> is also in <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>. You may suppose that I have very little time to myself. On Saturday I go again to <ref type="m" target="places.html#RydalMount">Rydale</ref> in order to dine on Sunday at M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Boltons (on Windermere)<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Storrs Hall on Windermere, Lake District home of John Bolton (1756–1837; <title>DNB</title>), a Liverpool merchant and leading supporter of Canning as MP for that city.</note> &#38; remain there on Monday to meet <ref type="m" target="people.html#CanningGeorge">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canning</ref>, who comes there to make his farewell visit. My guests meantime will take a three days circuit to Ennerdale &#38; Waswater, &#38; I shall rejoin them on Tuesday: they remain another week, &#38; then I shall be left to pursue my usual course of life at leisure.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">And now my dear Lightfoot let me, before I conclude, thank you for a visit which I shall look back upon with delight as long as we both live. It does not often happen that friends meet after so long a separation, &#38; find in each other so little change. God willing, I shall certainly see you in the winter, or at latest early in the spring.
