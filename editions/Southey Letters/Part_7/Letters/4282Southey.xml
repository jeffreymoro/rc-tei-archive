          <salute>  My dear Grosvenor</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1"> A sad account of <ref type="m" target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</ref> which <ref type="m" target="people.html#HughesMaryAnne">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Hughes</ref> sent me about ten days ago is all I had heard of him since your former letter, till that of to day arrived. It came originally from <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Wynn</ref>, – &#38; the inference I drew from it was that a paralytic stroke had deprived him of his intellect. Had there been any better tidings I thought <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> himself would have communicated them, – but all I have seen of his handwriting for some months has been upon your cover this day. What the ground is for hope I cannot tell, as I am quite at a loss to guess even at the nature of the disease, – but it is plain that <ref type="m" target="people.html#KiddJohn">Kidd</ref> has hoped, – &#38; the <hi rend="ital">vis vitae</hi><note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">‘vital force’.</note> appears to have been unusually strong, that even on that ground hope may be entertained</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> I am convinced that both the will &#38; the power exist in the quarter where you &#38; I wish to find them, &#38; might reasonably look for one &#38; expect to find the other. But I think that <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">he</ref> is not fully aware of his own power, unless it be exerted in the immediate straight course of office, &#38; that his will is palsied by a sort of indolence, – which makes (or used to make) him always late upon a journey, or in whatever he had to do, – &#38; always disposed rather to be doing anything else, than that which ought then to be done. If this had not been the case, <ref type="m" target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</ref> – whom it would always have been an honour to have preferred, would not have gone without preferment so long, – nor have obtained so poor a preferment at last.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Elmsley became Principal of Alban Hall, Oxford, and Camden Professor of Ancient History in 1823. He had turned down the Bishopric of Calcutta, which Wynn had offered him.</note> There are cases in which Procrastination is worse than a thief, – it is a murderer.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> But the kindness of his heart &#38; the steadiness of his attachments are his own, – the drawbacks are constitutional &#38; accidental: – a regular political life, to which he has been trained from his youth up, tends to sear all feelings; – the statesmen of this country are a bad <hi rend="ital">cast</hi>e, &#38; of all that caste the Grenvilles are the coldest the proudest &#38; the most selfish.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The political family of which Wynn’s uncle, <ref type="m" target="people.html#GrenvilleLord">Lord Grenville</ref>, was the most distinguished member.</note> Nature has been very bountiful to him in his affections &#60;&#38; dispositions&#62;, – for he had nothing good to inherit on either side.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> His attachment to me I believe to be unabated, many as are the causes which might have weakened or worn it out. Difference of rank &#38; circumstances I do not take into the account, – because they existed at the beginning, far more than at present – when I have won for myself (tho not a fortune) a station in society. But there is little sympathy in our taste, &#38; in some of our opinions – the most decided opposition, – &#38; that too upon <del>xx</del> points to which he has pledged himself with most warmth: &#38; which I considerable as demonstrably most perilous to the <del>xx</del> vital interests of these kingdoms.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Wynn was strongly in favour of Catholic Emancipation; Southey was vehemently opposed.</note> Yet these differences have not lessened his regard for me, – nor has any estrangement been produced by long absence, &#38; the unfrequency even of epistolary intercourse. During the last twenty years we have not seen so much of each other as we did in any one month at Oxford.</p>
          <p rend="indent1">  I had some time ago an instance of the manner in which friendly feelings are neutralized by political considerations. You know that I think not only of a Book of the State,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s ‘Book of the State’, his companion to <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824), was never written.</note> but of a Hist. of English Literature &#38; <hi rend="ital">Manners</hi>.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">This project did not result in a book; the surviving notes that Southey put together were posthumously published as ‘Collections for the History of Manners and Literature in England’, <title>Common-Place Book</title>, ed. John Wood Warter, 4 series (London, 1849–1850), I, pp. 439–578.</note> For both these works I want the publications of the Record Committee,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Commissioners on the Public Records of the Kingdom had been periodically appointed since 1800. They authorised the publication of the <title>Statutes of the Realm</title> (1810–1825) in nine volumes as well as a large number of medieval records.</note> – &#38; <del>cannot</del> &#60;could not&#62; afford to buy them, – when they were to be sold. They are now I believe at the disposal of the Commissioners, – certainly at somebodys disposal, &#38; I asked <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> if he could get them for me. His reply was that if he did, it would give Mr Hume,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph Hume (1777–1855; <title>DNB</title>), a radical MP who was much disliked by Southey for his campaigns against public expenditure.</note> or some such person, a handle for attacking him. – Now I should have thought he would have been well <hi rend="ital">pleased</hi> with an attack <del>against</del> which he might have repelled so triumphantly, – &#38; I am very sure that he would not have wanted persons who would, even in that house, warmly have approved such a disposal of books, – which are lying useless in <del>thx</del> some warehouse.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Edith</ref> is now in town, – tho I fear she will have little chance of seeing you, – unless you will volunteer to breakfast with her, &#38; agree upon some morning for that purpose. She is at <ref type="m" target="people.html#GonneMrs">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Gonnes</ref> – 16 York Place.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">   - I can enter into your Canterbury feelings – <ref type="m" target="people.html#HughesThomas">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hughes</ref> having sent me last week Woolnoths Description of that Cathedral,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">William Woolnoth (1780–1837), <title>A Graphical Illustration of the Metropolitan Cathedral Church of Canterbury</title> (1816), no. 2916 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> – as an expression on his part <del>xx</del> that I have deserved well of the Church. Talking of the Church I have heard that the Venerable Archdeacon Hook expects <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the Defender of the Faith</ref> to make him a Bishop.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">James Hook (c. 1772–1828; <title>DNB</title>), Archdeacon of Huntingdon 1814–1818, Dean of Worcester 1825–1828 and a noted Anglican polemicist. Southey had known him at school at Westminster and regarded him with disdain.</note> – When I write to <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">his Right Honour</ref> I shall tell him this. – My best remembrances to <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordHenry">Henry</ref> &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#Bedfordfamily">Miss Page</ref> –</p>
