            <p rend="indent1">These are indeed magnificent subjects, – nothing can be finer in their kind &#38; they have fallen into good hands.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Westall was producing <title>A Series of Views of Spain and Portugal, to Illustrate Mr. Southey’s History of the Peninsular War; Drawn on Stone by W. Westall, A.R.A., from Sketches by General Hawker, Mr. Locker, Mr. Heaphy, &#38;c. Part I, containing Eight Views, illustrating Vol. I</title> (1823). These could be inserted into the first volume of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> Under the river scene you had better say “Passage of the Tagus at Villa-Velha,” not Villa-Velha simply, because that is the name of a wretched old town which is not seen in the print. I cannot send you the reference to this, because it will occur in the last chapter, where I must put in a sentence on purpose <del>for</del> to introduce it.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), I, p. 758, where Southey noted that the crossing of the Tagus at Villa Velha was ‘a point, which, in former wars, has been considered the key to Lisbon’.</note> The other you must either call <del>Marvao xx with</del> Marvão; with that mark over the ã, or Marvam which is the manner whereby the same sound is denoted to a Portugueze eye, &#38; which I have always followed. The reference to this is Vol 1. Ch. 10. p. 483.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), I, pp 483–486 ,where Southey recounted the heroic resistance to the French invaders of Portugal by Antonio Leite de Araujo Ferreira Bravo (dates unknown), the magistrate of Marvão, a small border town.</note> Guarda is Vol 1. Ch. 10. p. 496.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Guarda is a Portuguese town burnt and looted by French troops in July 1808; <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), I, pp. 496–497.</note> That for Cintra<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Cintra was the site of the Convention of Cintra, 30 August 1808, <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), I, pp. 575–578.</note> I cannot give you till the clean sheets reach me. If you have any wish to give a page of letter press with each, it would be very easy for me to supply it.</p>

He was one of the earliest developers of large-scale pencil manufacturing in Keswick.</note> was spoken to about your pencils &#38; waited for lead of one of the sorts before he could execute the order. An opportunity would have offered for sending them next month by <ref type="m" target="people.html#MayJohn">a friend of mine</ref>, whom I expect here in June, &#38; to whom I shall be very glad to introduce you, if you happen to be here at that time because he is one of the best-hearted men in the world</p>
