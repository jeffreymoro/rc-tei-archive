            <salute>Dear Madam</salute></opener>
           <p rend="indent1"> Among all the “whys &#38; wherefores” which you may have found to account for my not acknowledging the receipt of a copy of D Carlos,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">John Russell (1792–1868; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Don Carlos; or Persecution. A Tragedy, in Five Acts </title>(1822). As Russell was a leading Whig, Ann Holmes may have been doubtful about Southey’s reaction to this gift. Russell had travelled widely on the Continent and spent the months November 1820–January 1821 and June–September 1821 in Paris, so he may well have met Ann Holmes there.</note> &#38; replying to the letter which you sent with it, – the true cause, I dare say, never occurred to you; – it is simply this, – that I never received either book or letter. My sentiments, Heaven be praised, are too tolerant, too kindly, too charitable (I will not call them <hi rend="ital">liberal</hi>, abused as that word is) – to keep me at a distance from any one because of any difference in opinions religious or political. What your opinions may be I know not; – mine are before the world, for those who like them, in private I obtrude them upon no one.</p>

This was a translation of Southey’s <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814). Sagrie did not translate any more of Southey’s works.</note> thinks it worth his while to bestow any more time upon the translation of any of my works, I will very willingly communicate to you for his use such facts &#38; dates relating to my own life as may serve his purpose.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> A translation of Roderick in three small volumes was sent me August last by the translator, who signs himself <ref type="m" target="people.html#BruguiereAntoine">B<hi rend="sup">on</hi> de Sorsum</ref>.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Antoine André Brugière, Baron de Sorsum, <title>Roderick, le Dernier des Goths</title> (1820), no. 2697 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library; see Southey to Antoine André Brugière, Baron de Sorsum, 30 October 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey.

Southey drew attention to this mistake in his <title>Poetical Works</title>, 10 vols (London, 1837–1838), IX, pp. x–xiii.</note></p>

Westall, R.A.</title> (1824), nos 2627–2628 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.

            <p rend="indent1"> <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">Lord Byron</ref>, I have little doubt, will return to the charge.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">In the ‘Appendix’ to ‘The Two Foscari’, <title>Sardanapulus, A Tragedy. The Two Foscari, A Tragedy. Cain, A Mystery</title> (London, 1821), p. 328, Byron had cautioned: ‘I am not ignorant of Mr. Southey’s calumnies on a different occasion, knowing them to be such, which he scattered abroad on his return from Switzerland against me and others.’ Southey had visited Switzerland in his continental tour of May–August 1817. The ‘calumnies’ Byron believed Southey to have later spread were rumours that Byron and Shelley had engaged in a ‘League of Incest’ during their residence in Switzerland in 1816. Southey had responded by writing to the Editor of the <title>Courier</title>, 5 January 1822, Letter 3776. His letter was published in the <title>Courier</title> on 11 January 1822.</note> I have the great advantage of being right, &#38; of being master of my temper. He can neither irritate nor injure me. The single charge which malice can bring against me is that I was a republican, or rather an Utopian at twenty, &#38; that as I grew older I grew wiser: modifying my speculative opinions both political &#38; religious, as I acquired more knowledge, but retaining always the moral principle with which I set out in life. <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">Byron</ref> is not fool-enough to believe that this is any impeachment of my character, <del>tho</del> but he is dishonest enough to join in the cry of a set of cut throats; – they deserve no better name, – for cut-throats they would be, as surely as Marat, Chaumette, Hebert<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Jean-Paul Marat (1743–1793), Jacobin journalist; Pierre Gaspard Chaumette (1763–1794), President of the Paris Commune; and Jacques Hébert (1757–1794), ultra-radical journalist. All were extremists and advocates of the Reign of Terror (1793–1794).</note> &#38;c &#38;c, if they every attained the same power. I despise these wretches too much ever to notice them, otherwise than collectively &#38; as regards the public weal. But if he persists in his ruffian-like attacks I will bestow upon him such farther chastisement as he deserves, well knowing that as I have the better cause, so also have I the stronger arm.</p>
