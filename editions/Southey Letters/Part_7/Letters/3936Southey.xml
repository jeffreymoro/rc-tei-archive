            <p rend="indent1">I had not forgotten Scheffer’s Suecia Literata,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Johannes Schefferus (1621–1679), <title>Suecia Literata</title> (1680), no. 2509 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> – but as that book is nearly a century &#38; half old, I regretted that the Swedes &#38; Danes should so much “contempt” each other, as <del>xxx</del> to prevent the union of their writers in one Bibliotheca. – The Danish is not a difficult language. I have been expecting for several years the publication of the Saxon chronicle,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">‘A new edition of the Saxon Chronicle, with an English translation and notes’, edited by James Ingram (1774–1850; <title>DNB</title>), Rawlinsonian Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford 1803–1808 was advertised as ‘in the press’ (<title>The Tradesman</title>, 14 (January 1815), 55). However, it did not appear until 1823. Southey acquired two copies, nos 2593–2594 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note> – which is to have a grammar prefixed to it, meaning whenever it came out to set about acquiring that language: – but it seems I shall be a Dane first.

The master was attached to him &#38; humoured him; &#38; hearing that his object was to pray that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Antonio would intercede with the Almighty for him, without which he thought it impossible to be saved, – asked him what he had done during so many years in England.

My answer<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to [Thomas Frognall Dibdin], 9 December 1822, Letter 3929.</note> expressed a willingness to hear what the bookseller<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Tegg (1766–1845; <title>DNB</title>), a publisher of popular works and abridgements of literary standards.

           <p rend="indent1"> This last week has been <hi rend="ital">odiously</hi> employed,<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had been writing his annual new year’s ode as Poet Laureate.

Poet Laureat’, <title>The Bijou: Or Annual of Literature and the Arts</title> (London, 1828), pp. 81–88.</note> – but I am not dissatisfied with the production. There are now some half dozen of this these task-poems by me which have not seen the light, &#38; which, one of these days, will do me no discredit.<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors">The following New Year’s odes that Southey had written were still unpublished at this date but appeared piecemeal throughout the 1820s and 1830s: January 1816, ‘Glory to Thee in thine omnipotence’, <title>The Doctor</title>, 2 vols (London, 1834), p. 207; January 1817, ‘Ode on the Battle of Algiers’, <title>The Plain Englishman</title>, 3 (1823), pp. 427–428; January 1818, ‘Funeral Song for the Princess Charlotte’, <title>Friendship’s Offering: A Literary Album and Christmas and New Year’s Present, for 1828</title> (London, 1828), pp. 1–6; January 1819, ‘Ode on the Death of Queen Charlotte’, <title>Friendship’s Offering and Winter’s Wreath: A Literary Album, and Christmas and New Year’s Present for MDCCCXXIX</title> (London, 1829), pp. 106–108; January 1820 and January 1821, ‘The Warning Voice: Ode I and Ode II’, <title>The Englishman’s Library: Comprising a Series of Historical, Biographical and National Information</title> (London, 1824), pp. 381–389; January 1822, ‘Ireland’, <title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title>, 2 vols (London, 1829), I, pp. [295]–302.</note></p>

The first volume ran to 806 pages.</note> The last chapter will bring to our recollection our journey to Madrid.<note n="18" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), I, pp. 756–806, dealt with the British Army’s retreat to Corunna in 1808–1809, travelling back along part of the route of Southey’s and Herbert Hill’s journey from Corunna to Madrid in December 1795–January 1796.</note> The description p. 542 of Roliça is from the journal which I made one &#38; twenty years ago, – even with the reflection at the end; – written at the Caldas while the impression was fresh.<note n="19" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), I, pp. 542: ‘The view from those heights is singularly beautiful, presenting just such objects as Gaspar Poussin delighted in painting, and in such combination as he would have placed in them; rocks and hills rising in the valley, open groves, churches with their old galilees, and houses with all the picturesque verandas and porticos which bespeak a genial climate; Obidos with its walls and towers upon an eminence in middle distance ..’. <title>Robert Southey: Journals of a Residence in Portugal 1800–1801 and a Visit to France 1838</title> (Oxford, 1960), ed. Adolfo Cabral, p. 17: ‘At once the Country changed – it became whatever fancy could conceive from Italian pictures, rocks and woods and buildings with all the picturesque varandas and porticos of a warm climate, and light and shade scarcely conceivable in England – and Obidos … the view, its heights crested by towers’ (Southey’s Journal, 4 March 1801). Southey wrote up this description while staying the next day at the little spa town of Caldas da Rainha.</note> – I am waiting for a Spanish Hist. of the war in Catalonia<note n="20" place="foot" resp="editors">‘On Spanish Literature, with some account of Francisco de Olivarez’, <title>New Monthly Magazine</title>, 10 (October 1818), 221–223, mentioned Olivarez’s <title>Account of the War in Catalonia</title> (1815). However, this book does not seem to exist.</note> to put the second vol. to press; as the first chapter must contain the movements in that province from the siege of Rosas, to the relief of Barcelona.<note n="21" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), II, pp. 37–59. French forces captured the town of Rosas on 5 December 1808 after a month-long siege and this allowed them to proceed to relieve the French army surrounded in Barcelona.</note> P[MS torn]e is a passage about Gen. Spencer, which is erroneous,<note n="22" place="foot" resp="editors">Lieutenant-General Sir Brent Spencer (1760–1828), British commander in Portugal and Spain 1808–1811. In <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1832), I, p. 371, Southey stated that Spencer had dispatched troops from Gibraltar who had successfully prevented a French advance along the Algarve.</note> – I followed printed dispatches in the Parl: papers, so positive that I submitted <del>xx</del> my own judgement to them, which it appeared afterwards I ought not to have done. For when <ref type="m" target="people.html#DalrympleHew">Sir Hew Dalrymples</ref> papers arrived, I found from his letters &#38; Lord Collingwoods<note n="23" place="foot" resp="editors">Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood (1748–1810; <title>DNB</title>), Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet 1805–1810.</note> that this was half-blunder, half braggadochio on the part of Spencer, – who is a <del>thorough</del> most incapable man. Unluckily it would have cost two cancels to get rid of this single sentence; &#38; there was so much expence &#38; inconvenience in this that (tho neither the one nor the other would have fallen on myself) I thought it best to let the matter pass, &#38; correct it silently in the future editions. I am not conscious of any other error; – but there are two voluntary omissions, – the one an offer on the part of <del>the for</del> Louis 18 &#38; his family to the Junta of Seville, to serve in the Sp. Armies<note n="24" place="foot" resp="editors">Louis XVIII (1755–1824; King of France 1814–1824). Louis was in exile in England in 1808 and looking for an opportunity to fight the Napoleonic forces. However, in 1822 his army was on the brink of invading Spain to defeat the liberal regime installed by the revolution of 1820. It might have embarrassed him if it had become known that he had offered to fight alongside the Supreme Junta in Seville that had assumed the monarch’s powers – much as the revolutionary forces had in 1820–1823.</note> – which I thought it might do them some injury at this time to make public. The other concerns our own government, &#38; is a striking instance of the baseness with which in difficult cases it leaves its servants without instructions, – for the sake of loading them with the responsibility of any failures that may ensue. The fact – is that before the commencement of the movements in Spain &#38; during the first movements, while <ref type="m" target="people.html#DalrympleHew">Sir Hew D.</ref> was in communication with Castanos,<note n="25" place="foot" resp="editors">Francisco Javier Castanos (1758–1852), Spanish General and commander of the ‘Army of the South’, the largest force opposed to the French invasion in 1808. Dalrymple was Acting Governor of Gibraltar 1806–1808.</note> – out of 37 dispatches, 34 of which related to these affairs, Lord Castlereagh<note n="26" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh (1769–1822; <title>DNB</title>), Secretary of State for War 1807–1809, Foreign Secretary 1812–1822.</note> only acknowledged <hi rend="ital">two</hi>, &#38; left him to act <del>without</del> as he thought best, – at his own peril. -</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I am richly stored with materials for the rest of the war, – so that it will be smooth sailing to the end. Compared to that of the Brazilian history<note n="27" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810–1819).</note> the labour seems nothing. The second vol. will come down to Massenas retreat,<note n="28" place="foot" resp="editors">André Massena (1758–1817) commanded the invasion of Portugal in 1810–1811. Southey did not deal with his retreat until <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), III, pp. 127–154.</note> – perhaps farther. I got at Zurich a German account of his campaign by a surgeon in his army, &#38; am just German enough to make it out.<note n="29" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Der Feldzug von Portugall, in den Jahren 1811 and 1812, in Historischer und Medizinischer-Hinsicht Beschrieben, von einem Artze der Franzosischen Armee von Portugall</title> (1816).
