            <p rend="indent1">We expect that <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref> will set off under the care of Miss Tolson<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Tolson (dates unknown). She had set up business in High Holborn, London, as a ‘linen-draper, dealer and chapwoman’, but was declared bankrupt on 8 July 1826. She started a new business in Regent Street as a ‘milliner and dress maker’, only to go bankrupt again on 16 May 1828.</note> (milliner) of Workington, on Wednesday, April 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> she goes by Manchester, &#38; will arrive in town either on the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> we suppose. If Lady M.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Lady Susanna Malet, née Wales (1779–1868), the widow of Sir Charles Malet, 1st Baronet (1752–1815; <title>DNB</title>), with whom Edith May Southey was staying in London.</note> can without inconvenience put off her departure for two or three days, that you might see her &#38; take proper measures for rigging her, it would be desirable; but if not, <hi rend="ital">paciencia</hi>,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">‘patience’ in Spanish.</note> so go you with Lady M. at any rate. <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Your mother</ref> hopes however that you will see <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanSusannah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Rickman</ref> before you set out, &#38; talk about <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref>. Miss Crosthwaite<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Crosthwaite (dates unknown), a linen and woollen draper in Keswick.</note> thinks that her escort will have her head quarters in Holborn; – but wherever that may be she will notify her arrival to <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanSusannah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> R</ref>, &#38; they will have the goodness to send for her. As far as we can tell – till we have seen Miss Tolson, – this appears to be the course of proceedings.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I will desire <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref>, my Chancellor of the Exchequer, to send you some money.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Isabel</ref> is getting well to day, after a weeks illness – a bilious affliction it has been.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> You remember <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">your Uncle Henrys</ref> report that the Ventriloquist was coming with a letter of introduction from <ref type="m" target="people.html#BilderdijkWillem">a Dutchman</ref>, whose wife was translating Roderick into Dutch.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Alexandre Vattemare (1796–1864), a celebrated French ventriloquist, who used the stage name ‘Monsieur Alexandre’. The introduction was from Willem Bilderdijk, whose wife, Katherina Bilderdijk, née Schweickhardt (1776–1830) had translated Southey’s <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814) into Dutch as <title>Rodrigo de Goth, Konig van Spanje</title> (1823–1824), no. 2701 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library, where it was described as ‘<hi rend="ital">red morocco, gilt leaves</hi>’; see Southey to William Peachy, 23 August 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3718.</note> This morning I received the first volume of the translation in a red morocco dress, with a Latin epistle from the husband, &#38; one in Dutch-English from <ref type="m" target="people.html#ClercqWillem">the merchant at Amsterdam</ref> who forwarded it, &#38; who being an author himself also, inclosed an essay of his own upon the character of “My Cid.’<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Willem de Clercq, ‘De Cid, Voorgesteld als Het Ideaal van den Held der Middeleeuwen’, originally published in <title>Magazijn voor Wetenschappen, Kunsten en Lettern</title>, 3 (1824), 192–244.</note> The translation appears to be very faithfully done, &#38; I <del>doubt</del> have no doubt very well, the husband being himself <del>the</del> one of the most, if not the most, distinguished critics &#38; poets of his country, &#38; a man of great erudition as well as great abilities. He is a very old man, having been known as a poet he tells me sixty years; – the wife is probably much younger as he <del>xxx</del> says they have been married a quarter of a century &#38; more.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Bilderdijk was only 63 years old at this time, but he was a chronic hypochondriac. His first poem was published in 1776 and his first major publication was the anonymous verse collection <title>Mijn Verlustiging</title> (1781), so his fame as a poet dated back 43 years, rather than the 60 years that Southey assumed to be the case. Bilderdijk and Schweickhardt married in 1802, but had lived together since 1797.</note> Her name is Katharina Wilhelmina Bilderdijk, &#38; she dedicates the translation to me, in a very good ode.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Rodrigo de Goth, Koning van Spanje</title>, 2 vols (The Hague, 1823–1824), I, pp. i–xii.</note> The poem is in the Dutch heroic verse – that is – 12 syllable rhyme, like that of the French.</p>
