           <salute> My dear Grosvenor</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">I found your letter to day with its inclosure, on our return from <ref type="m" target="places.html#Skiddaw">Skiddaw</ref> with <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Sirius</ref>, being my third ascent this season. If tomorrow be favourable (which the barometer seems to indicate it will not) we are to breakfast with <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> &#38; ascend Causey Pike, – &#38; on Wednesday <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Sirius</ref> takes his departure for London to our sorrow. I shall then be left to myself, &#38; to my needful occupations, which have been very long interrupted. – Great bodily exercise is incompatible with much mental exertion, &#38; I am so circumstanced as to stand in need of both. I must compromise the matter thro the winter as well as I can</p>
            <p rend="indent1">Have you seen a series of Costumes etched by Lewis as Illustrations of <ref type="m" target="people.html#DibdinThomasFrognall">Dibdins</ref> Tour.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">In 1818, the painter George Robert Lewis (1782–1871, <title>DNB</title>) had accompanied Thomas Frognall Dibdin on a continental journey. This was documented in Dibdin’s, <title>Bibliographical, Antiquarian and Picturesque Tour in France and Germany</title> (1821), no. 830 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. On the same journey Lewis made drawings which were etched and published as a series of <title>Groups illustrating the Physiognomy, Manners, and Character of the People of France and Germany</title>, issued in parts and completed in 1823, no. 1718 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. The intention was that these could be inserted as plates into Dibdin’s <title>Tour</title>. Plate 25 was titled ‘Peasants of the Environs of Paris’.</note> If you have not, look for them &#38; in the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> print, you will find as perfect a likeness as ever was produced of – John Cockbaine.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">John Cockbaine (1786–1873), Keswick draper and tailor.</note> Lewis avers it to be a faithful portrait, observing at the same time that few artists could have resisted the temptation of taking it.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">George Robert Lewis, <title>Groups illustrating the Physiognomy, Manners, and Character of the People of France and Germany</title> (London, 1823), p. 7: ‘there are few indeed, who, once having seen the original, could have resisted the temptation to preserve his representation unaltered.’</note> It appears therefore that Nature did not break the mould in which the Perfect Taylor was made. She was so pleased with it, that she made two <del>pers</del> who could only be paralleled by each other, – &#38; gave one to England another to France.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> Alas Johnny is growing old &#38; is no longer what he was in his prime. As a Taylor he must always remain unequalled, – the fair ideal of that character: but in ugliness he is rivalled by Wells Fisher the nephew &#38; successor of poor old John Fisher:<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">John Fisher (dates unknown) was the Keswick barber who also rented a room to visitors to the Lakes. Wells Fisher (dates unknown), his nephew, was described as a ‘jeweller, dealer and chapman’ when he went bankrupt in 1829.</note> a curious personage in his way, to whom you must be introduced.</p>
