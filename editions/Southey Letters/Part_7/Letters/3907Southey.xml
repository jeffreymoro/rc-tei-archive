Frere</ref> has sent me a box full of <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">his brothers</ref> papers, – I have as many bundles fastened with red tape before me, as if I were at the head of a public office, &#38; am a great deal busier with them than if I were paid two or three thousand a year for my work. These papers will carry on my narrative<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">For Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> very satisfactorily to the time when those which I had from <ref type="m" target="people.html#WellesleyMarquis">M Wellesley</ref> begin. But I shall very likely spring some other mines when I come to town.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#InglisSirRobert">Sir Robert Inglis</ref> has given me the first &#38; third volume of the Chronicas de la Provincia de Rel. Desc.

There is a great deal of curious matter in the book, – as indeed there is in almost all books of this kind. The good matter is mingled in them as it is in our county histories, – &#38; the rubbish is better worth raking.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> I have also added to my stores the two volumes of the earlier Edda published at Copenhagen in 1784 &#38; 1818<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Edda Saemundar hinns Froda. Edda Rhythmica seu Antiquor, Vulgo Saemundina Dicta</title> (1787–1818), no. 918 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. He never acquired the third volume, published in 1828.</note> – a third is soon expected to compleat the work. Were it only for its copious glossaries it would be exceedingly curious, but the poems themselves are of the most curious kind. At the same time I obtained a Bibliotheca Danica<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Jens Edvard Kraft (1784–1853) and Rasmus Nyerup (1759–1829), <title>Almendeligt Litteraturlexicon for Danmark, Norge og Island</title> (1820), no. 1407 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> – I wish it had included Swedish as well as Norwegian &#38; <del>Islandic</del> &#60;Icelandic&#62; authors.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">Like you, it is not often that I meet with any one who can enter into my pursuits. People come to look at me as a live poet, little thinking how compleatly I have ceased to exist as such, &#38; that I have as little inclination to write verses, as to play at pottle<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Pottle was a simple card game.</note> or whip a top. Now that I am left to myself &#38; to my ordinary <del>xxxx</del> habits, I take every night after supper with my blackcurrant rum (thanks be to your friend Hoblyn<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Hoblyn (1751–1839). He was a Christ Church contemporary of Herbert Hill (matriculated 1768, BA 1771) and inherited Nanswhyden House, where Southey and Hill stayed in November 1795 on their way to Falmouth to take ship for Spain.</note> for introducing me to that <del>xxx</del> admirable tincture!) – a composing dose of Dutch looking thro the huge work of Aitzema,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Lieuwe van Aitzema (1600–1669), <title>Sakem van Staet en Oorlogh in emde Omtrent de Vereenigde Nederlanden</title> (1655–1671), with the continuation by Lambert van den Bos (1610–1698) of 1685–1699, and Aitzema’s <title>Verhael van de Nederlansche Vrede-Handeling</title> (1671), no. 214 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> from which I shall make no inconsiderable gleanings. It is an invaluable repository of facts for the greater part of the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century; &#38; a great deal which it contains is not to be found elsewhere.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> The other day I finished the Life of Philippes de Mornay,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Philippe de Mornay, Seigneur du Plessy Marly (1549–1623), <title>Histoire de la Vie de Messire Philippes de Mornay, Seigneur de Plessis Marly &#38;c</title> (1647), no. 1892 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> better known among us by that name, than by his title of Du Plessis. The book is heavy, but it shows how much intrigue was mixed up with the affairs of the Hugonots, – &#38; Du Plessis himself seems to have been a perfect example of integrity. – When I come to you in the spring I shall set upon your Sully.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Maximilien de Bethune, Duke of Sully (1560–1641), <title>Memoires des Sages et Royales Oeconomies d’Estat Domestiques, Politiques et Militaires de Henry le Grand, l’Examplaire des Roys, le Prince des Vertus, des Armes &#38; des Loix &#38; le Pere en Effet de ses Peuples Francois</title> (1638), no. 2664 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> By that time I shall have pretty nearly finished the earlier Memoirs as far as my set goes.</p>
