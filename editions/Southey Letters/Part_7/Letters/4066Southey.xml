<salute>My dear Sir</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">I received with much pleasure the account of your ubiquitarian movements, &#38; the assurance of good health &#38; good spirits which such movements imply. For myself, tho having (thank God) no cause to complain on the score of either, I have not moved beyond the limits of this vale since you left it. Neither an invitation, twice repeated to meet <ref type="m" target="people.html#CanningGeorge ">Mr Canning</ref> at Storrs,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Storrs Hall on Windermere, Lake District home of John Bolton (1756–1837; <title>DNB</title>), a Liverpool merchant and leading supporter of Canning as MP for that city.</note> nor another from <ref type="m" target="people.html#YorkRichard">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> York</ref> to Wighill Park to the Musical Festival<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Richard York invited Southey to the ‘Yorkshire Grand Music Festival, for the Benefit of York County Hospital, and of the General Infirmaries of Leeds, Sheffield and Hull’ on 22–25 September 1823 in York Minster.</note> could draw me from home. Whatever time could be spared from my desk I wanted to enjoy in excursions with our friends of the Island.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"><ref type="m" target="people.html#CharterLouisa">Louisa Charter</ref>, and Elizabeth Charter (1782–1860), friend of the poet George Crabbe (1754–1832; <title>DNB</title>). They were the sisters of <ref type="m" target="people.html#PeachyEmma">Emma Peachy</ref>, first wife of William Peachy, and nieces of Sir Charles Malet (1752–1815; <title>DNB</title>), 1st Baronet, a prominent diplomat with the East India Company. Peachy had lent the Charter sisters his home on Derwent Island. They were accompanied by Lady Susanna Malet, née Wales (1779–1868), widow of Sir Charles Malet, 1st Baronet (1752–1815; <title>DNB</title>), the maternal uncle of the Charter sisters. Their other companion was one of Sir Charles Malet’s three children in India with Amber Kaur (b. 1772): Eliza (b. 1791); Henry Charles (1793–1844); and Louisa (b. 1795). They accompanied Malet to Britain in 1798 and were brought up with his children by Susanna Malet. Eliza Malet married, in 1812, Robert Ekins (1785–1874), Vicar of Godalming 1810–1833, Rector of Folke, Dorset 1833–1843, Perpetual Curate of North Wootton 1843–1854. Southey is probably referring here to Louisa Malet.</note> The season has been singularly unpropitious for such parties, – by much the worst within my remembrance which extends now to twenty years in this country. Thro the spring we lived in hope of what summer might bring with it, thro the summer our hopes were for autumn, October is now come &#38; the weather still as unsettled as <del>however</del> ever. However we have taken advantage of every interval.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">We made successful ascents of <ref type="m" target="places.html#Skiddaw">Skiddaw</ref> &#38; of Cawsey Pike, down chimney of which the Ladies came in great style, Miss Charter, <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> S.</ref> &#38; one or two more (for we moved in great force) who were afraid of the ascent, awaiting us at the bottom with a very respectable pic-nic set out. Our next dinner of the same kind was by the Lake side in Manesty Woods. Another day I led the ladies up Walla Crag by a way which would not have suited your friend M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Awdrey.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">John Awdry (1766–1844) was married to Jane, née Bigg-Wither (1770–1845), sister of Herbert Hill’s wife. Awdry was a solicitor and minor landowner, and Southey had stayed with him in Switzerland in 1817 soon after Peachy had visited Awdry.</note> Last Monday we dined just where the descent into Borrodale, from Buttermere Haws commences – we were three carts &#38; five saddle horses, &#38; I know not how many more than twenty persons (your friends M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Portel &#38; his daughter<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably William Portal (1755–1845) of Ashe Parke, Hampshire, his wife Sophia, née Slade (1760–1837), and their daughter, Sophia Portal (d. 1875). The Portal family were descended from Huguenot refugees and owned the firm that produced banknotes for the Bank of England.</note> among them) the mountains have seldom seen such a caravan.

She is lodging at Timmy Ladymans,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Timothy Ladyman (1774–1846), a Keswick ironmonger.</note> but takes her departure in the course of next week. Your friends are very much pleased with her, &#38; she with them.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">You will be more grieved than surprized to hear that we have lost <ref type="m" target="people.html#EdmondsonDr">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Edmondson</ref>. After ten weeks lingering, his old complaint has carried him off. When the disease was for a time removed, Nature had not the strength to rally, &#38; thus he sunk under a renewed attack. It was his desire that I should assure you that your plate would be as secure in the care of his family, as it was during his life time. He was buried on Thursday, &#38; I believe few persons have ever gone to the grave more deservedly, or more generally regretted in their sphere. <ref type="m" target="people.html#CalvertWilliam">Calvert</ref> &#38; I have been talking today upon the fitness of erecting a subscription tablet in the Church to his memory, as was done (with far less reason) in the case of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Denton.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Isaac Denton (c. 1758–1820), Vicar of Crosthwaite, Keswick 1786–1820.</note> A man so skilful in his practise, so conscientiously moderate in his charges so friendly in his services, – so eminently useful in his generation deserves the tribute of respect &#38; gratitude. <ref type="m" target="people.html#CalvertWilliam">Calvert</ref> will propose it to Sir Frederic Vane<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Frederick Fletcher-Vane, 2nd Baronet (1760–1832), of Hutton in the Forest, though he mainly lived at Armathwaite Hall on Bassenthwaite. Fletcher-Vane was a leading local Whig and opponent of the Lowther interest, serving as MP for Carlisle 1796–1800 and 1801–1802, and MP for Winchelsea 1792–1794 and 1806–1807.</note> &#38; Sir Fred. Morshead.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Frederick Treise Morshead, 2nd Baronet (1783–1828), of Derwent Lodge, Keswick.</note> I undertook to mention it to you, &#38; to <ref type="m" target="people.html#BeaumontSirGeorge">Sir G Beaumont</ref>. And we shall find some fit person to call upon the people of the place, who will feel how fitting it is, &#38; how creditable to themselves, that this should be done.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">A tablet to honour John Edmondson was commissioned and placed in St Kentigern’s, Crosthwaite.</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1">You will see in the last Quarterly a paper of mine upon the new edition of Burnet,<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Bishop Burnet’s History of his Own Time: with the Suppressed Passages of the First Volume and Notes by the Earls of Dartmouth and Hardwicke, and Speaker Onslow, Hitherto Unpublished; to Which are Added the Cursory Remarks of Swift, and Other Observations </title>(1823), no. 498 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.

Southey reviewed it in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 29 (April 1823), 165–214, published 27–28 September 1823, and used the occasion to survey the reign of Charles II (1630–1685; King of Great Britain 1660–1685; <title>DNB</title>).</note> &#38; a most excellent one upon Spain by my friend <ref type="m" target="people.html#WhiteJosephBlanco">Blanco White</ref>,<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">Blanco White’s review of Michael Joseph Quin (1796–1843; <title>DNB</title>), <title>A Visit to Spain; Detailing the Transactions which Occurred during a Residence in that Country in the Latter Part of 1822, and the First Four Months of 1823.
