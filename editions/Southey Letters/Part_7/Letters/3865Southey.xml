Southey also owned an edition from 1696, printed at Lisbon (no. 3502 in the sale catalogue of his library). The book was originally published in 1645 under the pseudonym ‘Clemente Libertino’.</note> I have two copies of his book, the one a reprint at Madrid in 1808 which speaks of the book (tho thrice printed) as of extraordinary rarity in Portugal as well as Spain. Rare in Portugal however it could not have been, or you would not have had two copies. The new edition has a life of the author. Here it was that I found the Miquelets, when I read the book several years ago.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Francisco Manuel de Mello, <title>Historia de los Movimientos, Separacion y Geurra de Cataluna en tiempo de Felipe IV</title> (Madrid, 1808), pp. xi–xxvi (‘Vida del Autor’); pp. 242–243 (origin of the term ‘Miquelet’ for Catalan irregular troops).</note> The Expedicion de los Catalanes is here.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Francisco de Moncada (1586–1635), <title>Espedicion de los Catalanes y Aragoneses contra Turcos y Griegos</title> (1623), no. 3547 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1">To my great surprize, I found this day that one of Montaignes Essays is an account of the Brazilian savages drawn up by him from the communications of an ignorant man who had gone over with Villegagnon.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was reading the works of Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592) in Pierre Coste (1668–1747), <title>Les Essais de Michel Seigneur de Montaigne</title>, 10 vols (London, 1754), I, pp. 215–216, no. 1977 in the sale catalogue of his library. Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon (1510–1571) had tried to establish a French colony in Brazil in 1555–1558.</note> Among other things he gives two Tupinamba songs in French, one of them is a sort of death-song &#38; turns upon that identical bravado which is given in the poem of Caramuru as a feat occurring in Para, &#38; which I have noticed Vol 2. 641.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>History of Brazil</title>, 3 vols (London, 1810–1819), II, pp. 640–641, where Southey recounted the bravery of an indigenous man who was to be sacrificed and eaten. He gave as one of his sources José de Santa Rita Durão (1722–1784), <title>Caramuru: Poema Épico do Descobrimento da Bahia</title> (Lisbon, 1781), pp. 161–166. Southey had already translated this passage in his <title>Letters Written During a Short Residence in Spain and Portugal</title> (Bristol, 1797), pp. 488–489.</note> There are several curious things in this paper, which I shall fit into their proper places. It is more than five &#38; twenty years since I read Montaigne in an old translation.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">John Florio (1553–1625; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Essayes, Written in French by Michael, Lord of Montaigne; done into English, according to the Last French Edition</title> (1613), no. 1913 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> I am now going thro him in your small edition – having always some book at hand to take up in those fractions of time which would else run to waste.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> What I said about your Chief, as you call him, &#38; the Pen.

            <p rend="indent1">Two Danish poets have very civilly sent me some of their works, Oehlenschlager,<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">Adam Oehlenschläger (1779–1850), Danish poet and playwright.

            <p rend="indent1">Ostervalds friend<note n="20" place="foot" resp="editors">A German visitor called Bielh, who had called on Southey on 24 February 1822. Jean Frédéric Ostervald (b. 1749), a Swiss from Neuchatel and son of Frédéric Samuel Ostervald (1713–1795), publisher and founder of the Société Typographique de Neuchatel (STN). Ostervald was in Portugal in the 1790s and was secretary to the legation and chargé d’affaires at the British Embassy 1792–1793 while Robert Walpole (1736–1810; <title>DNB</title>), Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary 1771–1800, was in Britain. Ostervald was an old friend of Herbert Hill, and Southey had written to him during his continental journey in 1817. This letter had produced some correspondence with Ostervald’s nephew, Jean Baptist Isaac Harlé (1773–1854), a merchant at St Quentin; see Southey to Herbert Hill, 15 March 1818, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Five</title>, Letter 3093.</note> has not made his second appearance.</p>
