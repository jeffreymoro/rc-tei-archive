            <p rend="indent1">I am heartily glad to hear of <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillEdwardJnr">Edwards</ref> success.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Hill had taken ‘The Challenge’, a gruelling examination at Westminster School to select the King’s Scholars. He had placed fifth, thus guaranteeing himself a Scholarship.</note> – He has had the disadvantage of not having the Westminster grammars<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Westminster School had its own instruction manuals from which boys learnt Latin and Greek; for example, <title>A Short Introduction to the Latin Grammar for the Use of the Lower Forms in Westminster School</title> (1821).</note> – (abominable ones they are!) at his fingers ends, – &#38; therefore must have &#60;been&#62; more likely to make trifling slips himself, &#38; less alert at detecting them in another than his opponents. Success in such a contest is no more a test of capacity, or proficiency, than the full crop of a turkey who is in training for the cook, is a proof of the birds appetite.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#HillEdwardJnr">Edward</ref> has <del>xxx</del> done with all such trials, if <del>xx</del> he should be elected to Ch. Ch: – there is nothing for him to get there. If to Trinity he will be contented with the scholarship while it lasts, unless he should determine upon an academical life, – which is not the most conducive either to happiness, or to intellectual improvement.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">King’s Scholars could proceed to a Closed Scholarship at either Christ Church, Oxford, or Trinity College, Cambridge. There was no certainty that a King’s Scholar would receive a Fellowship once he graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge. However, at Christ Church, a King’s Scholar immediately became one of the body of Students, with a modest stipend that was guaranteed for life, if the recipient wished and if he obeyed the rules of the College. If they took university degrees in a timely fashion their stipend would increase. However, the rules governing Studentships were strict and anyone who married, did not take Holy Orders, or accepted a paid occupation had to resign. Edward Hill chose Christ Church, Oxford. The Studentships at Christ Church were initially worth about £50 or £60 a year, those at Trinity College about £25.</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1">The principle of emulation is carried much too far in modern education. Many men are absolutely killed by it at the Universities, &#38; many more injure their constitutions irreparably. No one with whom I have any influence shall ever suffer from that cause. The habit to be encouraged is that of placid diligence. What is thus healthily acquired is retained: whereas the cramming system hurts the digestion. My chief reason for wishing that <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillEdwardJnr">Edward</ref> may be elected to Oxford, is because they cram there less than at Cambridge</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I am not surprized at <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillCatherine">my Aunts</ref> determination concerning <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillErrol ">Erroll</ref>.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had offered to ask Wynn, as President of the Board of Control, to nominate Erroll Hill to either: a cadetship at Addiscombe Military College, which trained officers for the East India Company’s army; or to a writership (the lowest civil service post) in the East India Company. This latter option often involved two years’ training at the East India College at Haileybury. Herbert Hill’s wife, <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillCatherine">Catherine Hill</ref>, had declined this offer of help.</note> Indeed I rather expected it; &#38; yet, as the thing would (I have no doubt) have been in my power, it seemed proper to mention it.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">It is well for us that in youth we do not see the objections which <del>xxx</del> &#60;exist&#62; to every profession in life, – if we did, life <del>would</del> &#60;might&#62; be at an end before one could venture to make the choice. <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillEdwardJnr">Edwards</ref> I hope will be made for the Church. He will take a little Hebrew with him from Westminster; – little enough, but still a foundation. I shall advise him before he leaves school to master the German grammar, – which ten minutes a day would enable him to do. No person knows better than I do what small gains amount to, in accumulations of this kind. <del>&#38;</del> This language is of main importance in most literary researches.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s reading knowledge of German was limited, though he could understand Dutch, mainly due to his historical research for the <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810–1819).</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1">You will not wonder (knowing how prone, in Persian phrase my ‘pen of the steed is, to expatiate in the plain of prolixity.”<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Jonathan Scott (1753–1829; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Bahar-Danush: or, Garden of Knowledge.

Southey’s copy was no. 94 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note>) that the Book of the Church is swelling into two ordinary sized octavos.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824). The first volume ran to 394 pages and the second to 528.</note> The fact is that I intended to deal in generals, but found as I went on that it was the particulars which must &#60;give&#62; life &#38; effect to the composition. As far as it has gone I am well satisfied with it. A view of the papal system is just printed,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Book of the Church</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), I, pp. 283–320.</note> which is likely to produce a proper effect.

I think of dedicating it to <ref type="m" target="people.html#HowleyWilliam">the Bp. of London</ref>.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Book of the Church</title> was dedicated to Peter Elmsley.</note></p>
