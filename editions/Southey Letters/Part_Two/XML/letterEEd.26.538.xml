<p>My dear Wynn</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Your letter, or packet has, this morning reached me. but thro the
                    Portugueze post office, like all other letters, &amp; at the expence of half a
                    moidore. do not imagine that half a moidore could have procured me an equal
                    quantity of pleasure in any other way, but the people in office, in England, are
                    ignorant <del rend="strikethrough">of their</del> how far their own privilege
                    extends, &amp; often make us pay a heavy double postage by franking their
                    letters. the direction which I gave you to Captain Yescombe,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Bayntun Yescombe (1765–1803), Captain of
                        the packet, <hi rend="ital">King George</hi>, which sailed between Falmouth
                        and Lisbon.</note> Falmouth, covering my direction, will bring all parcels
                    safely &amp; without farther expence than carriage to Falmouth. Letters should
                    go by the regular channel, unless a private hand can take them.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> You must long ere this have received my second letter.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn,

                    spirits that cast a sunshine upon every thing. I pray you make peace, that I may
                    return in the spring over the Pyrenees. the cause would certainly be good, &amp;
                    so would the effects. – I shall print the whole of <ref target="people.html#CroftHerbert">Sir Herbert Crofts</ref> letter<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Herbert Croft, <title>Chatterton and ‘Love and

                            Gentleman’s Magazine, where it appeared in February, March and April
                            1800; Respecting an Unprovoked Attack, made upon the Writer during his
                            Absence from England</title> (1800).</note> in the Chatterton &amp;

                    not of the genus irritabile.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Thalaba is finished &amp; I am correcting it. the concluding
                    books you shall shortly receive. the Haleb description<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
<title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801), Book 6, line 338
                        mentions the city of Haleb. In the manuscript copy of <title>Thalaba</title>
                        sent to Wynn (National Library of Wales, MS 1487A) this is followed by six
                        lines of description of the city, omitted in the published version.</note>
                    (which is accurate) was an insertion, &amp; shall be an omission. giantly<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    the old mint. I used it to avoid the sameness of sound in The gi<hi rend="ital">ant</hi> tyr<hi rend="ital">ant</hi>, <del rend="strikethrough">which</del>

                            <title>Thalaba</title> during composition.</note> &amp; do not remember
                    the elision. you object likewise to a licence which I claim as lawful, that of
                    making two short syllables stand for one long one. the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

                    acknowledged errors. you will I trust find the Paradise a rich poetical picture
                    – a proof that I can employ magnificence &amp; luxury of language when I think
                    them in place. the other faults you point out are remedied.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Thank you for <ref target="people.html#StracheyGeorge">George

                    feelings found no centre, &amp; &lt;therefore they&gt; have been scattered. he
                    will probably succeed in worldly prospects far better than I shall do, but he
                    will not be so happy a man, &amp; his genius will bring forth no fruits. I love
                    him dearly, &amp; I know he never can lose the instinctive attachment which led
                    to our boyish intimacy. Yet <ref target="people.html#StracheyGeorge">Strachey</ref> shrunk from me in London. I met him at your rooms – he was
                    the same immutable character – I walked home with him at night, our conversation
                    was unreserved – &amp; in silence &amp; solitude I rejoiced even with tears that
                    I &lt;had&gt; found <del rend="strikethrough">xxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxx</del>
                    &lt;again the friend that was lost&gt;. from that time a hasty visit is all I
                    saw of him. it was his indolence – I know he esteems me. Our former coolness, I
                    remember among my follies. you were with me when I atoned for it by a voluntary
                    letter, &amp; you saw an answer such as I had reason to expect. I wrote again to
                    him, a common young mans letter; he never answered it. the fact was I had the
                    disease of epistolizing &amp; he had not. – Our future intercourse cannot be
                    much. by the time he returns to London I trust I shall have retired from it,
                    &amp; pitched my tent near the churchyard in which I shall be buried Of the E.

                    literary pursuit. About the language <ref target="people.html#StracheyGeorge">S.</ref> is right. it is a baboon jargon not worth learning: but were I

                        the sacred texts of Hinduism.</note> &amp; get them translated. it is rather
                    disgraceful that the most important acquisition of Oriental learning should have
                    been given us by a Frenchman. but Anquetil du Perron<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Abraham-Hyacinthe Anquetil Du Perron (1731–1805),

                        the Zend-Avesta.</note> who disgraced himself by enviously abusing him.
                    latterly Sir Williams works are the dreams of dotage. I have some distant view
                    of manufacturing a Hindoo romance, wild as Thalaba: &amp; a nearer one of a
                    Persian story of which see the germ of vitality. I take the system of the
                    Zendavesta for my mythology, &amp; introduce the powers of Darkness persecuting
                    a Persian, one of the hundred &amp; fifty sons of the Great King: every evil
                    they inflict, becomes the cause of developing in him some virtue which his
                    prosperity had smothered. an Athenian captive is a prominent character – &amp;
                    the whole warfare of the Evil Power ends in exulting a Persian Prince into a
                    Citizen of Athens. I pray you be Greek enough to like that catastrophe, &amp;
                    forget France when you think of Attic republicanism.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I have written no line of Poetry here except the four books of
                    Thalaba, nor shall I till they are corrected &amp; sent off, &amp; my mind
                    compleatly delivered of that subject. some credit may be expected from the poem,
                    &amp; if the Booksellers will not give me 100 £ for a 4to edition of 500 copies
                    – or 140 for a pocket one of 1000: why they shall not have the poem.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">
<title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801) was
                        published in octavo, or pocket, form. Southey received £115 for 1,000
                        copies.</note>

<p rend="indent1"> I long to see the face of a friend, &amp; hunger after the bread
                    &amp; butter comforts &amp; green fields of England. yet do I feel so strongly
                    the effects of climate – &amp; I am now sweating in my shirt while I write, in
                    the coolness of <ref target="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</ref>, a darkened room,
                    &amp; a wet floor – yet so much better do I like the climate &amp; feel it, that
                    I certainly wish my lot could be cast somewhere in the south of Europe. the spot
                    I am in is the most beautifull I have ever seen or imagined – I ride a jack ass
                    – a fine lazy way of travelling – you have even a boy to beat old dapple when he
                    is slow. I eat oranges figs &amp; delicious pears. drink Colaras wine – a sort
                    of half way excellence between Port &amp; Claret. read all I can lay my hands on
                    – dream of poem after poem &amp; play after play, take a sesta of two hours,
                    &amp; am as happy as if life was but one everlasting today, &amp; that tomorrow
                    was not to be provided for.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Here is a long letter about myself &amp; not a word about

<p rend="indent1"> I am sorry <ref target="people.html#StracheyGeorge">Strachey</ref> is so disgusted with India, tho I cannot wish he were
                    otherwise. from all accounts an English East Indian is a very bad animal. they

                    choice – a man who feels &amp; thinks must be in solitude there. yet the comfort
                    is that your wages are certain – so many years of toil for such a fortune at
