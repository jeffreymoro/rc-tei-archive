                    last part of the old Bishops sentence gives me the most heavenly picture of all.

                        two poems on Charlemagne, <title>Charlemagne ou le Retablissement de

                            <title>Charlemagne</title> (1664).</note> Should you see these they are
                    such little books that however small your portmanteau they would not crowd it –

                    sixpennyworth of duty rascally duty as it is; – &amp; I dare swear as worthless

                        commander, whose exploits were the subject of numerous poems and tales.

                    eagerly about it, but not very acutely. I like the old boys sermon<note n="18" place="foot" resp="editors">William Vincent, <title>A Defence of Public
                            Education</title> (1801) had robustly refuted allegations about the lack

                    not use me well – but I have been in good humour with him ever since he wrote
                    about public schools.</p>

<ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaretEdithdau">My little girl</ref> has
                    taught me some new feelings – I have learnt to see beauty in that total absence
                    of all thought &amp; all feeling in an infants face, as soon as there is good
                    matter in town she is to be inoculated for the cow pox – I begin to think D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Jenner<note n="19" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward

                        recognition of the fact that he had made his findings freely

<p rend="indent1"> Now were you in England &amp; that the M.P. would cover the sin –
                    I would not write a line farther – having in truth nothing to say – &amp; quite
                    enough to do – but &lt;to send&gt; a blank page thro a foreign office were
                    committing a huge trespass. De meipso<note n="20" place="foot" resp="editors">The Latin translates as ‘concerning myself’.</note> then for the uppermost
                    subject. I have transcribed two parts of my Moorish chapter<note n="21" place="foot" resp="editors">An early section of Southey’s unfinished
                        ‘History of Portugal’.</note> – the few who have seen it think it good –
                    &amp; it satisfies me. the other two parts of this period are sketched – one is
                    the effect of the superstitions of the Spaniard – how they assisted them in
                    recovering their country – the other will be the picture of their manners –
                    &amp; here come in the history of Bernardo del Carpio<note n="22" place="foot" resp="editors">Bernardo del Carpio was a legendary hero of medieval
                        Spain.</note> – of the Infantes of Lara<note n="23" place="foot" resp="editors">The Infantes of Lara were seven princes who, in an early
                        medieval legend, were murdered by their uncle. Their heads were served up
                        on a platter to their father.</note> – &amp; lastly the Cid. the whole will
                    be about an hundred pages – no disproportionate length of preliminaries. A
                    palace requires a portico. – the life of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Francisco<note n="24" place="foot" resp="editors">St Francis of Assisi (1181/2-1226),

                    &amp; will soon come into butterfly beauty. for the previous history of the
                    Spanish church I must wait till I procure the Spanish Councils. but my head is
                    hatching a chapter upon <del rend="strikethrough">the</del> monachism from the
                    period when it was caught in Egypt – down to the ripening of the Cistercian
                    order under S. Bernard.<note n="25" place="foot" resp="editors">St Bernard of

                    popery. – the cucumbers which I have heaped together so much dung to produce. by
                    Xmas I shall have as much as a first volume ready to show you – for my
                    attachment to the work grows as the work itself – &amp; moreover there is a spur
                    in the thought that when all is done that can be done here – I shall see Lisbon
                    once again – &amp; mount my Mule for another thousand miles in Portugal. if you
                    could see how <hi rend="ital">foggy</hi> this weather is at this minute, you
                    would not wonder that I am ready to grumble with this climate.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I am afraid that <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my
