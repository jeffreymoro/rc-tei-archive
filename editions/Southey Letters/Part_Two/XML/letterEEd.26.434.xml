<p rend="indent1"> I direct to you at a venture – whenever this
                    may find you, write by return &amp; say where you are that I
                    may know where to look for you.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> We went from Bristol to Minehead where I
                    passed as uncomfortable a fortnight as I ever remember. <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> was during
                    the whole time exceedingly unwell. as she grew better we
                    fell upon this plan. she should go to <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">her sisters</ref> at
                        <ref target="places.html#Stowey">Stowey</ref>, which was
                    not far distant. &amp; I would walk down the North coast to
                    Ilfracombe. if on my return she was better we might proceed.
                    if not – it was better to return to Bristol.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> At Minehead I received a letter from <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref>

                    Sidmouth, or along that coast. so we housed ourselves as

<p rend="indent1"> Now Tom I mean to walk round the coast to
                    Plymouth, &amp; it will be very unlucky if <del rend="strikethrough">we</del> I should not meet with
                    you. if you are at Torbay you can <del rend="strikethrough">surely</del> perhaps come to us. however I shall set
                    off on my walk on Tuesday or Wednesday next. Coleridge will
                    I believe walk with me &amp; I expect to see a fine country.

                    of Somersetshire all that I have yet seen in this county is
                    very tame &amp; uninteresting.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I breakfasted with <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMary">Aunt Molly</ref> at
                    Bishops Lediard,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had breakfasted with his aunt on 12 August

                    somewhat amused at seeing that she sold leather breeches
                    among other articles. also I passed the Cottage,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Home of Southey’s wealthy
                        bachelor uncle, <ref target="people.html#SoutheyJohn">John Southey</ref>.</note> which is an ill-looking
                    place enough, &amp; might with equal propriety be called a
                    palace – being as much like one as the other. I slept one
                    night at Taunton at the inn – &amp; wishd you had been there
                    to have given me a peep at the Tauntonians.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> We go to <ref target="places.html#Burton">Burton</ref> at Michaelmas<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">29 September 1799.</note> which will soon

                    some progress is made, almost to the end of the second book.
                    the remaining part of Madoc shall come in my knapsack, if

<p rend="indent1"> I have seen the Valley of Stones, which
                    itself is wonderfully fine &amp; stands close by some of the
                    most magnificent scenery I ever beheld. Tom you have talked
                    of Somersetshire &amp; its beauties, but you have never seen
                    the finest part of Somersetshire. the neighbourhood of <ref target="places.html#Stowey">Stowey</ref> of Minehead
                    &amp; Porlock exceed anything I ever saw in England
                    before.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> At Exeter I find some old books. my remarks
                    upon the city are that it stinks. &amp; that on public
                    rejoicings they ring <hi rend="ital">two</hi> bells at one
                    church – &amp; <hi rend="ital">one</hi> at another – which
                    make excellent ding dong music. the place by the beastly
                    slovenliness or sluttishness or swinosity of its pork-people
                    reminds me of Lisbon, &amp; like Lisbon its situation is
                    adapted for cleanliness.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I am very busy on many huge plans. among
                    others a great hexameter work, in conjunction with <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref>:<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Coleridge and Southey’s plan for a jointly-written poem
