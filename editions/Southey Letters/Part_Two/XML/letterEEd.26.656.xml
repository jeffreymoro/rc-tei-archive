                    has done, &amp; affirms that Lord S.s groom who was the
                    go-between, is rewarded with a place under government.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Burnett had been

                    Joseph Banks between them have found out that the Terra

                        the view of Sir Joseph Banks (1743-1820;
                            <title>DNB</title>) that Terra Japonica, or Catechu,
                        an extract obtained from mimosa wood, was rich in tannin
                        and could therefore be used in the process of tanning
                        leather. As Terra Japonica was cheaper than oak bark,
                        the substance usually employed, its widespread use might
                        reduce the price of leather goods. Davy publicised his
                        discovery in ‘An Account of some Experiments and
                        Observations on the Constituent Parts of Certain
