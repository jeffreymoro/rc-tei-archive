<salute>My dear Danvers.</salute>
</opener>
<p rend="indent1"> You will be expecting me – &amp; will be
                    disappointed at receiving only a letter. I cannot yet depart
                    – in about a month we shall set off – earlier or later by
                    some ten days as may suit a ship – if we find one.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Your letter must have been lost – &amp; it
                    leaves me in the dark about some things alluded to in that
                    which has just reached me. I know not why <ref target="people.html#DavyHumphry">Davy</ref> has left
                        Bristol<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Humphry
                        Davy was in negotiations to accept the post of assistant
                        lecturer in chemistry at the Royal Institution, which
                        would involve a move from Bristol to London.</note> –
                    &amp; shall bitterly miss him. indeed the doubt where to
                    settle annoys me much. except you &amp; <ref target="people.html#DanversMrs">your mother</ref> I have
                    no attachment at Bristol. all else are mere acquaintance – a
                    common – cold – lip – intercourse – neither gratifying the
                    affections nor the intellect. in London I neither can nor
                    will live. I must be where the Sun &amp; Moon &amp; Stars
                    &amp; He who created them are visible. As for <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> he is at the end of the world.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Keswick.</note>
                    Bristol suits me best, &amp; a house about Ashton, or Leigh,
                    or over the down would strongly tempt me – or in your row.
                    but not yet. my autumn must be in Wales &amp; Cumberland,
                    &amp; I have to work hard to recover my expences here &amp;
                    raise enough for furniture. The little I saw of <ref target="people.html#KingJohn">King</ref> much pleased me
                    – but <ref target="people.html#DavyHumphry">Humphry
                        Davy</ref> is an unreplaceable companion. For society of
                    all places I have ever seen Norwich is the best. Bristol has
                    so many divisions &amp; subdivisions of party &amp; sects; –
                    &amp; poor <ref target="people.html#CottleJoseph">Cottles</ref> shop is a loss.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Financial difficulties had caused Joseph
                        Cottle to close his bookshop in Wine St., Bristol in
                        1799.</note> – twas a gossip-place of meeting that tho
                    it might make some idle hours made some pleasant ones.
                    however to Bristol I look on as my future home, its
                    reachable distance from London &amp; Hereford where <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref>
                    will most likely be one day settled – the neighbouring woods
                    &amp; rocks &amp; walks with which I have so old an intimacy
                    – the printing office too is some inducement. &amp; as there
                    is no keeping <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my
                        Mother</ref> from that miserable dungeon or rather
                    Bedlam where she will immure herself<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
<ref target="places.html#CollegeGreenBristol">College
                            Green</ref>, the home of Margaret Southey’s
                        half-sister, Elizabeth Tyler.</note> – the best thing
                    possible that I can do is to have a house near where she may
                    go in any short lucid interval.</p>
<p rend="indent1">
<ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">My Uncle</ref> is
                    removing his books piecemeal as opportunity allows for
                    shipping them. four boxes are consigned to you by the
                    inclosed bill of lading. they are all English – that is
                    English-printed (for some may be Greek or Latin) &amp; in
                    English binding, therefore liable to no duty. If <ref target="people.html#KingJohn">King</ref> could house
                    them for me at the Wells it would be better than lodging
                    them in the <ref target="places.html#CollegeGreenBristol">College Green</ref>, as they will be in the latter case
                    almost inaccessible to me. the foreign books we try to
                    smuggle into England, &amp; have succeeded in landing one
                    valuable box. the number of my own books which are now of a
                    very serious value, &amp; also of <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncles</ref>
                    that are lying idle &amp; dead about England, must soon
                    anchor me. they cannot follow me, &amp; I therefore must
                    settle with them.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> That you have been so long without a letter
                    you will probably attribute to the right cause – I &amp;
                        Waterhouse<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Samuel
                        Waterhouse (dates unknown), later a prominent figure in
                        the British community in Portugal.</note> have
                    accomplished our tour in Algarve. we have seen the whole of
                    that kingdom, &amp; half the province of Alentejo. a labour
                    of 530 miles – 23 days – during which we endured some
                    hardships from the miserable state of the country –
                    sometimes being able to procure neither bread nor wine –
                    &amp; four times reduced to beg a nights lodging for want of
                    estalagems. In compensation we have seen much, &amp;
                    acquired some knowledge. I will not skim the cream of the
                    journey – my journal<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s journal of this tour was published in Adolfo

                            1838</title> (Oxford, 1960), pp. 33-61.</note> with
                    a few conversational comments may furnish an evenings
                    amusement in Bristol. I have now only the three small
                    northern provinces to visit. Beira, Tras os montes, &amp;
                    Entre Douro e Minho, look at the map &amp; you will see they
                    are not quite a third of Portugal. but they form its most
                    beautiful, most interesting, &amp; most populous part. I am
                    in truth very desirous of remaining yet six months – the
                    summer at <ref target="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</ref> – to
                    Porto in September, &amp; thence over the North. Only <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Ediths</ref> wishes to
                    return prevent me – in other respects it would be every way
                    advantageous inasmuch as the more I labour here, the nearer
                    my supplies will be when I return. It is only since <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncles</ref>
                    return from England that he has encouraged my historical
                        labours.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s unfinished ‘History of Portugal’.</note> he
                    was not perhaps quite aware of the literary rank which I
                    hold in the world, till he there learnt it, &amp; found some
                    of his own friends apprized of my design &amp; anxious for
                    its execution. now he forwards it in every way, &amp; hunts
                    out books &amp; information with as much zeal &amp;

                    scruples of conscience in matters of taste. it is begun in
                    rhymes – as irregular in length, cadence, &amp; disposition
                    as the lines of Thalaba. I write them with equal rapidity –
                    so that on the score of time &amp; trouble there is neither
                    loss or gain. But it is so abominable a sin against what I
                    know to be right – that my stomach turns at it. it is to the
                    utmost of my power vitiating, or rather continuing the
                    corruption of public taste. it is feeding people upon French
                    cookery, which pleases their diseased &amp; pampered
                    palates, when they are not healthy enough to relish the
                    flavour of beef &amp; mutton. my inducements are – to avoid
                    any possible sameness of expression – any mannerism, &amp;
                    to make as huge an innovation in rhymes as Thalaba will do
                    in blank verse. but I am almost resolved to translate what
                    is already done into the Thalaban metre.</p>

                        Norwich. Southey preferred that his brother, <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henry

                    Martineau will, if he chuses to leave him, return 3 fourths
                    of the fee. this was handsome &amp; unexpected. I hope the

                    suspect him to be possessed of either intellectual or moral
                    strength to resist the ruin of a University. God bless you.
