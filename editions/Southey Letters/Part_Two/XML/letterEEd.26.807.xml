<salute>My dear Sir </salute>

<p rend="indent1"> It is very long since I have heard from you –
                    &amp; the defaulture is certainly on your side now. but I
                    suppose you are soldiering again &amp; busy in organizing
                    the defence of the country.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Biddlecombe had been a member of the
                        Christchurch Gentlemen and Yeomanry Cavalry until
                        October 1801.</note> this unlucky, &amp;, in my
                    judgement, unavoidable war has actually placed England in
                    greater peril than she has ever been subject to since the
                    days of the Armada,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The attempt to invade England in 1588 by Spain.</note>
                    but that peril is every day diminishing, &amp; if the
                    measure of teaching every man the use of arms be carried
                    into effect, the country will be safe for ever. tis what old
                    Major Cartwright<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">John
                        Cartwright (1740-1824; <title>DNB</title>), radical and
                        proponent of universal suffrage.</note> has been crying
                    out for these thirty years – &amp; now Wyndham<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">William Windham (1750-1810;
                            <title>DNB</title>), Secretary at War 1794-1801. He
                        played a prominent part in the debates over the Army of
                        Reserve Acts in June and July 1803.</note> proposes it –
                    &amp; we are to have it decreed by parliament!<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The Army of Reserve Acts
                        (1803) provided for a new Army of Reserve to defend
                        Britain from invasion. If any parish could not provide
                        enough volunteers, there was a ballot of all the adult
                        male parishioners. The government also called for a new
                        volunteer force to harass any invading French
                        army.</note> Wyndham arming the people! such are the odd
                    changes of the world. It is a most important step, for if it
                    be acted upon with common prudence it would preclude the
                    necessity of ever keeping up any other military
                    establishment, but this must not be looked for. patronage is
                    too essential to the governors to let them ever drop a
                    standing army.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I was in town last week – as if you have seen
                    Miss Rickman<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Rickman’s sister, Mary Rickman (dates unknown).</note>
                    you probably have learnt. &amp; I had the good fortune to
                    see Westminster Abbey<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">There was a fire in the roof of Westminster Abbey on 9
                        July 1803.</note> before the fire was quite
                    extinguished. a most impressive sight it was, &amp; a very
                    fine one. when the extent of the mischief was known – &amp;
                    that in fact it was rather a good thing than an evil, as
                    nothing but the poor &amp; paltry patchwork – wooden roofs
                    &amp; painted canvass. the works of modern parsimony were
                    consumed. the Choir was full of smoaking ruins when I got
                    into the Church, &amp; sparks &amp; burning fragments still
                    falling – &amp; the light came in thro the chasm &amp; made
                    the noble pillars &amp; stone arched roof look far more
                    grand &amp; magnificent than I had ever before seen them:
                    they looked as if they had been built for eternity. the
                    floor in Poets Corner sunk so with the effect of the water
                    that I half expected to have seen my old acquaintance Lady
                        Strathmore<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary
                        Eleanor Bowes, Lady Strathmore (1749-1800;
                            <title>DNB</title>). She was buried in Westminster
                        Abbey.</note> &amp; her speaking trumpet. there ought to
                    be some punishment for the Plumbers when they occasion such
                    fires. it is perpetually happening. one or two of these
                    fellows should be thrown into the flames – it would not be
                    the first time that men had been so sacrificed for the good
                    of the Church.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I am going to reside near London – probably
                    at Richmond. will you have the goodness to send off the
                    remainder of my books &amp;c to <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref>. I hope
                    soon to collect them all together, &amp; indeed have already
                    begun the heavy labour of cataloguing them. The main motive
                    which takes me to that neighbourhood is to manage &amp;
                    superintend a great literary undertaking – a Bibliotheca
                    Britannica which you will see announced as to be done, in
                    the next Monthly Magazine.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">
<title>Monthly Magazine</title>, 16
                        (August 1803), 51; the project was abandoned by Longman
                        and Rees in August 1803.</note> this title commonly
                    means only a dictionary of authors &amp; their works, but by
                    giving it a chronological arrangement, adding biography
                    &amp; criticism, &amp; connecting chapters it may be made a
                    readable &amp; very interesting book, as well as the most
                    important work for a scholar &amp; indeed for every man of
                    letters, that exists in the language. the extent cannot be
                    guessed – eight or ten large quartos at least, but it will
                    be published in parts – that is half volumes like the
                        Cyclopaedia.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">The
                            <title>Cyclopaedia: or An Universal Dictionary of
                            Arts and Sciences</title> was an encyclopaedia,
                        first published in 1728, and much expanded and
                        republished throughout the eighteenth century,
                        especially by Abraham Rees (1743-1825;

                            Cyclopaedia</title>, 45 vols (1802-1820).</note> Of
                    course I am to have many assistants, but the plan &amp;
                    authority &amp; whole management are mine.</p>
