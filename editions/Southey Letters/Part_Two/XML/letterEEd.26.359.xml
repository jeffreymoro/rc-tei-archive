<p rend="indent1"> So long is it since I have written to you that I write almost at
                    random. a thousand changes may have happened – perhaps I may misdirect. day
                    after day &amp; week after week have I thought of writing, &amp; always
                    something to do or think of has prevented me. in the summer I was some days at
                    Abberley. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Severne<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Francis Severn
                        (1751–1828), Rector of Kyre and Abberley, Worcestershire, was married to a
                        sister of <ref target="people.html#SewardEdmund">Edmund Seward</ref>.</note> &amp; the two <ref target="people.html#Sewardfamily">Miss Sewards</ref> both particularly
                    requested to be remembered to you when I wrote, &amp; added how happy they
                    should be to see you in Worcestershire. the <ref target="people.html#Sewardfamily">Miss Sewards</ref> are sadly altered. the
                    eldest was ill, &amp; Elizabeth, tho actively employed, in a sad state of health
                    – she looks sixty years of age. in other respects they are the same women as
                    ever, but I saw them &amp; remember them with pain. never was a family so
                    destroyed.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I am at <ref target="places.html#Westbury">Westbury</ref>, a
                    village two miles from Bristol, with no children of my own, but a ready made
                    family of relations. sedentary habits, always my choice &amp; of late rendered
                    necessary, have injured my health something. this I am endeavouring to remedy by
                    a little medicine &amp; much exercise. the world &amp; I however agree well
                    together. I have as much enjoyment as a man ought to expect or desire, &amp; as
                    for labouring for it, there is something pleasant in not being one of the drones
                    of society.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I have a <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">brother</ref> Lightfoot nearly fifteen years of age. I design to made a
                    surgeon of him. he has been somewhat neglected. but during the last year has I
                    hope made some progress. anothers years Latin &amp; Greek is necessary for him
                    &amp; in looking round for a school at which to place him, you recurred to my
                    recollection. are you still at Kingsbridge? &amp; what are the terms of the
                    school in which you are engaged? he is a boy of great talents, from whom if he
                    turns out well, much may be hoped. for the last year he has been with <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</ref>, but a change in <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnetts</ref> situation renders it
                    necessary to remove him now.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> By the papers I learn the death of <ref target="people.html#DaveyJohn">John Davy</ref>, &amp; the election of <ref target="people.html#ParsonsJohn">Parsons</ref> to the Mastership of Balliol,
                    an event by which I think the College must be benefitted. I was glad to see they
                    had made so good a choice. Griffiths<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> recognized me at Hereford this summer, I had forgotten
                    him. Of the Xt Church men with whom you may remember me to have been intimate,
                        <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> is still my most
                    particular friend.<ref target="people.html#CombeEdward"> Combe</ref> I often see
                    when in town. <ref target="people.html#ButtJohnMarten">Martin Butt</ref> is
                    settled as a Curate at Witley the parish adjoining Abberley, &amp; the <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">Chancellor</ref> who examined him for
                        ordination<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Herbert Hill was
                        Chancellor of Hereford Cathedral; hence Southey’s inside knowledge about
                        Butt’s examination.</note> said he passed an examination fit for a Bishop. a
                    good Theologian &amp; a good man he bids fair to be an honour to the Church. I
                    had much serious conversation with him &amp; was exceedingly at seeing my old
                    schoolfellow in so very respectable a light. <ref target="people.html#CollinsCharles">Charles Collins</ref> is in high life.
                    he forced me once to dine with him but so disgusted me by his intolerable vanity
                    &amp; pride of purse, that I have followed the example of all his school &amp;
                    college friends &amp; totally dropt his acquaintance. his whole conversation was
                    what he could afford to give for pictures, carriages, horses, pipes of wine
                    &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> You would perhaps smile were I to give you a list of all the
                    works I have in my head or even in hand. in the press I have a second edition of
                    my Letters, &amp; a second volume of Poems.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">A second, revised edition of Southey’s <title>Letters Written
                            During a Short Residence in Spain and Portugal</title> was published in

                        volume one was a third edition of the collection first published in 1797;
