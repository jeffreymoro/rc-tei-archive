<salute>My dear Rickman</salute>

<p rend="indent1"> This morning I called on <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</ref>, whom I
                    found recovering from a bilious flux &amp; in the act<del rend="strikethrough">x</del> of folding up a letter
                    designed for you. he then for the first time showed me your
                    letter, &amp; his reply. I perceived that the provoking
                    blunder in <ref target="people.html#LambCharles">Lambs</ref>
                    direction affected the tone of yours <del rend="strikethrough">other</del>, &amp; that the
                    seventeen shillings-worth of anger fell upon <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">George</ref>. your
                    caustic was too violent, it eat thro the proud flesh – but
                    it has also wounded the feeling &amp; healthy part below.
                    the letter which I have suppressed was in the same stile as
                    his last. I prevailed on him to lay it up in his desk –
                    because it was no use showing you the wound you had
                    inflicted – &amp; your time would be better any how employed
                    than in reading full pages that were not written with the
                    design of giving pleasure. That your phrases were too harsh
                    I think &amp; <ref target="people.html#LambCharles">Lamb</ref> &amp; <ref target="people.html#LambMaryAnne">Mary Lamb</ref> think also. twas a horse medicine – a
                    cruel dose of yellow <hi rend="ital">gamboodge</hi>
<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The resinous sap of
                        the gamboge tree is a drastic purgative.</note>(tho I do
                    not mean to insinuate that it occasioned his diarrhoœa.)
                    –</p>
<p rend="indent1"> What I foresaw – or rather hoped would take
                    place is now going on in him. he begins to discover that
                    hackneying authorship is not the way to be great. to allow
                    that six hours writing in a public office is <hi rend="ital">better</hi> than the same number of hours labour for a
                    fat publisher – that it &lt;is&gt; more certain – less
                    toilsome – quite as respectable. I have even prevailed on
                    him to attend to his hand-writing – on the possibility of
                    some such happy appointment – &amp; doubt not ere long to
                    convince him, in his own way, of the moral fitness of
                    writing straight lines &amp; distinct letters – according to
                    all the laws of mind. he <hi rend="ital">wishes</hi> to get
                    a tutors place. in my judgement a clerks would suit him
                    better, for its permanence. nothing like experience! he
                    would <del rend="strikethrough">be</del> not think its
                    duties beneath him. &amp; if he were so set at ease from the
                    daily bread &amp; cheese anxieties that would disorder a
                    more healthy intellect than his – I believe that passion for
                    distinction which haunts him, would make him in the opinion
                    of the world – the booksellers – &amp; himself – a very
                    pretty historian. quite as good as any of the Scotch breed –
                    It puzzles me how he has learnt to round his sentences so
                        <del rend="strikethrough">xx</del> ear-ticklingly. he
                    has never rough-hewn any thing – but he finishes like a
                    first journeyman.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Write to him some day, &amp; lay on an
                    emollient plaister. it would heal him – &amp; comfort him. a
                    very active man we shall never have. but as active as nature
                    will let him he soon will be – &amp; quite enough for daily
                    official work. If you could set him in the Land of
                        Potatoes<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Ireland.</note> we should, I believe in conscience see

                        ‘improbable prophecy’ is unclear. Southey was consistent
                        in his contempt for <title>Alfred</title>, correctly
                        prophesying that it would be ‘condemned to eternity’,

                    no mention was made about Egypt – the silence satisfied me –
                    because Portugal is a better &amp; far more suitable
                    subject. it is odd that he has never asked me to dine with
                    him – &amp; not quite accordant with his general courtliness
                    of conduct. Seeing little of him – I have not formed so high
                    an opinion of his talents or information as you had led me
                    to conceive. doubtless in his own department he possess both
                    – but on all other ground I am the better traveller – &amp;
                    he hardly knows the turnpike when I have beat thro all the
                    by ways &amp; windings &amp; cross roads. I found it
                    expedient to send him my sundry books in compliance with a
                    hint to that effect. he called to thank me – &amp; this
                    dropping a card has been the extent of <del rend="strikethrough">my</del> personal &amp; avoidable
                    civility. to my great satisfaction I have entire leisure –
                    that is to my <hi rend="ital">present</hi> comfort – for it
                    does not promise much for the future.</p>
