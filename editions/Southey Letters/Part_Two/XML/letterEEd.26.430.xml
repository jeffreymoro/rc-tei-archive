                            The Wordsworth Circle, 5 (1974),
                        93.Dating note: In his letter to Danvers of
                        Tuesday, 20 August 1799 (Letter 428), Southey asked
                        Cottle to immediately forward three copies of the
                        recently-published Annual Anthology
                        (1799). This letter is dated by Southey as ‘Sunday’ and
                        thanks Cottle for the books, making its most likely date
                        to be Sunday, 25 August 1799.</p>

<salute>My dear Cottle –</salute>
</opener>
<p rend="indent1"> The books arrived safely. I was vexed to see
                    the paragraph you had added to the Preface<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">‘Advertisement’,
                            <title>Annual Anthology</title> (Bristol, 1799),
                        (unpaginated). The final paragraph inserted by Cottle
                        ran as follows: ‘It is the intention of the Editor to
                        publish annually a similar volume. Communications are to
                        be addressed to Messrs. BIGGS &amp; Co. Printers, <hi rend="ital">Bristol</hi>, for the Editor of the
                        Annual Anthology. It is requested that the Writer will
                        enclose his address, that the piece may be returned, if
                        found inconvenient to insert.’</note> – the more vexed
                    because every person who has yet seen the volume cry out
                    against the folly of <del rend="strikethrough">it</del>
                    desiring an opportunity of telling contributors their verses
                    are bad. people who wished their peices returned would have
                    said so without being asked. the sentence can only operate
                    to prevent <del rend="strikethrough">post</del> men of
                    diffidence from sending me anything. I cannot conceive why
                    you added it – to say the best of it it is perfectly useless
                    – &amp; I am afraid it will be mischievous. if it were
                    possible the leaf should be cancelled.</p>

                        287–288.</note> there is no harm done as matters now
                    are. but in <ref target="people.html#BeddoesThomas">Beddoes</ref> after the reason assignd for not
                    inserting it it was very very <hi rend="ital">indelicate</hi>. &amp; the arrogance &amp; impertinence
                    of the man have irritated me. I desire that no future
                    application be made to him for contributions. if he sends
                    them he may but I will not be dictated to. nor treated with
                    impertinence by any man. <ref target="people.html#BeddoesThomas">Beddoes</ref> has my
                    respect &amp; respectful voice – I look up to him as a
                    useful &amp; benevolent man, the agent of much good – but in
                    this instance he has behaved with an indelicacy of which I
                    could have suspected no one.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> The volume is very good. <del rend="strikethrough">or more xxxxxx it may be xxxxxxxx
                        xxxxxxxxxx it with my xxxxx xxxxxx – xxx xx xxxx xxxxxx

<p rend="indent1"> In the Volume few &amp; trifling alterations
                    only are made. it is always to build a new house than repair
                    one originally ill-plannd. it will be better perhaps at the
                    end to advertise only my books.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">There were no advertisements at the end
                        of <title>Annual Anthology</title> (1799) or

                    this as you judge best. you will be good to have an equal
                    number of large copies struck off with the second volume
                    &amp; direct <ref target="people.html#BiggsNathaniel">Biggs</ref> to be as uniform with that as possible.</p>

                    in mind that a little thought upon common occasions is very
                    useful. so you must receive it with the same levity that it
                    is written with.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I hope to have the second Anthology out in
                    January – so do you beat up. it will be a better volume than
                    the first. we must if possible go to press at the beginning
                    of November.</p>
