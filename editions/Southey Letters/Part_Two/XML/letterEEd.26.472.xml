                    have no objection so to colour the dose or flavour it as to disguise its
                    medicinal virtue from sight &amp; taste. my name I would not affix – nor would a
                    wise bookseller require it – the indelible <del rend="strikethrough">epithet</del> character of republicanism sticks to it. The history should
                    commence with the agrarian governments – &amp; conclude with the death of the
                    principle in France – where it now lies with little hope of a joyful
                        resurrection.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">France had adopted the
                        Constitution of the Year VIII on 24 December 1799. It concentrated power in

                        government.</note> One might make a grave &amp; good chapter in examining

                    somewhere – probably at Trieste, but from thence, if I had a companion to make

                    Constantinople.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I like your Carol much – &amp; the ode – tho the <hi rend="ital">why</hi> of the latter is not quite so palpable as it should be.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">In his letter to Southey of 28 December 1799,

                        Devonshire’, <title>Morning Post</title>, 24 December 1799. Both were
                        included in <title>Annual Anthology</title> (Bristol, 1800), pp. 79–82,

                        was a legendary fourteenth century hero in the struggle for Swiss
                        independence. Southey, though, was incorrect. In most versions of the Tell
                        legend he did kill Hermann (or Albrecht) Gessler, the Bailiff of Altdorf and
                        local representative of Austria.</note> – supposing the tale to be true
                    which assuredly it is not. howbeit let that pass. tis a good story &amp; fit ‘to

                    twenty pounds a volume – but it is a sort of focus – a something on which so

                    be loth to have it drop.</p>

                        legalised prostitution. Moreover, Southey is probably also recalling the
