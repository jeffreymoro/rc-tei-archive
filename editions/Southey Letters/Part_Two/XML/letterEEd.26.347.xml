                        Mansion House’, published in <title>Poems</title>, 2

                    shall profit by them. I am partial to “There was” because it
                    is a nursery tale beginning, but in this case it will be
                    better to preserve a dramatic form throughout. the traveller
                    shall be made modern in his taste – but whether it be well
                    to have any thing like discovery in these short pieces I am
                    doubtful. The following eclogue does not please me so much
                    as the first, but it is seditious &amp; true to nature. it
                    wants something. I had introduced &lt;it&gt; by some
                    descriptive lines but they were useless &amp; now it seems
                    to want description. again I have a traveller, &amp; as I am
                    afraid I shall want another of these peripatetics, this is a
                    reason for making the first the owner of the mansion.</p>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent5"> Traveller</l>
<l rend="indent3"> I pray you wherefore are the village
                        bells</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Ringing so merrily?</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Woman.</l>
<l rend="indent6"> A wedding Sir, −</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Two of the village folk; &amp; they are
                        right</l>
<l rend="indent3"> To make a merry time o’nt while they
                        may;</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Come twelvemonths hence I warrant them
                        they’d go</l>
<l rend="indent3"> To church again, more willingly than
                        now</l>
<l rend="indent3"> If all might be undone.</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Traveller.</l>
<l rend="indent6"> An ill-matchd pair,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> So I conceive you. youth perhaps &amp;
                        age?</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Woman</l>
<l rend="indent3"> No – both are young enough.</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Traveller.</l>
<l rend="indent6"> Perhaps the man</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Is idle then, &amp; one who better
                        likes</l>
<l rend="indent3"> The alehouse than his work.</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Woman.</l>
<l rend="indent6"> Why Sir for that –</l>
<l rend="indent3"> He always was a well-conditioned lad,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> One who’d work hard &amp; well, &amp; as
                        for drink,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Save now &amp; then mayhap at Xmas
                        time,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Sober as wife could wish.</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Traveller.</l>
<l rend="indent6"> Then is the girl</l>
<l rend="indent3"> A shrew, or else untidy; one who’d
                        welcome</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Her husband with a most unruly
                        tongue,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Or drive him from a foul &amp; wretched
                        home</l>
<l rend="indent3"> To look elsewhere for comfort. is it
                        so?</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Woman.</l>
<l rend="indent3"> She’s notable enough; &amp; as for
                        temper</l>
<l rend="indent3"> The best good-humourd girl! – dye see
                        that house</l>
<l rend="indent3"> There by the willow trees whose grey
                        leaves shine</l>
<l rend="indent3"> In the wind? She lives a servant at the
                        farm;</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And often as I came to weeding here</l>
<l rend="indent3"> I’ve heard her singing as she milkd her
                        cows</l>
<l rend="indent3"> So chearfully, – I did not like to hear
                        her,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Because it made me think upon the
                        time</l>
<l rend="indent3"> When I had got as little on my mind</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And was as chearful too. – but she would
                        marry</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And folks must reap as they have sowd.
                        God help her!</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Traveller.</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Why Mistress. if they both are well
                        inclin’d</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Why should not both be happy?</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Woman.</l>
<l rend="indent6"> They’ve no money.</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Traveller.</l>
<l rend="indent3"> But both can work, &amp; sure as
                        chearfully</l>
<l rend="indent3"> She’d labour for herself as at the
                        farm.</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And he won’t work the worse because he
                        knows</l>
<l rend="indent3"> That she will make his fireside ready for
                        him</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And watch for his return.</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Woman.</l>
<l rend="indent6"> All very well.</l>
<l rend="indent3"> A little while.</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Traveller.</l>
<l rend="indent6"> And what if they are poor</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Riches can’t always purchase
                        happiness,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And much we know will be expected
                        there,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Where much was given.</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Woman.</l>
<l rend="indent6"> All this I’ve heard at church</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And when I walk in the churchyard or have
                        been</l>
<l rend="indent3"> By a death-bed, tis mighty
                        comforting.</l>
<l rend="indent3"> But when I hear my children cry for
                        hunger</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And see them shiver in their rags – God
                        help me!</l>
<l rend="indent3"> I pity those for whom these bells ring
                        up</l>
<l rend="indent3"> So merrily upon their wedding day,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Because I think of mine.</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Traveller.</l>
<l rend="indent6"> You have known <del rend="strikethrough">xxxxxx</del> trouble,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> These haply may be happier.</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Woman.</l>
<l rend="indent6"> Why for that</l>
<l rend="indent3"> I’ve had my share, some sickness &amp;
                        some sorrow,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Well will it be for these to know no
                        worse.</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Yet would I rather hear a daughters
                        knell</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Than her wedding peal Sir, if I thought
                        her fate</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Promised no better things.</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Traveller.</l>
<l rend="indent6"> Sure sure good woman</l>
<l rend="indent3"> You look upon the world with jaundiced
                        eyes.</l>
<l rend="indent3"> All have their cares, they who are poor
                        want wealth</l>
<l rend="indent3"> They who have wealth want more; so are we
                        all</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Dissatisfied, yet all live on, &amp;
                        each</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Has his own comforts.</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Woman.</l>
<l rend="indent6"> Sir d’ye see that horse</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Turnd out to common here by the
                        wayside?</l>
<l rend="indent3"> He’s high in bone, you may tell every
                        rib</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Even at this distance. mind him – how he
                        turns</l>
<l rend="indent3"> His head to drive away the flies that
                        feed</l>
<l rend="indent3"> On his galld shoulder! – theres just
                        grass enough</l>
<l rend="indent3"> To disappoint his whetted appetite.</l>
<l rend="indent3"> You see his comforts Sir!</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Traveller.</l>
<l rend="indent6"> A wretched beast!</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Hard labour &amp; worse usage he
                        endures</l>
<l rend="indent3"> From a bad master, but the lot of the
                        poor</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Is not like his.</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Woman.</l>
<l rend="indent6"> In truth it is not Sir!</l>
<l rend="indent3"> For when the horse lies down at night, no
                        cares</l>
<l rend="indent3"> About tomorrow vex him in his dreams.</l>
<l rend="indent3"> He knows no quarter day, &amp; when he
                        gets</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Some musty hay, or patch of hedge row
                        grass</l>
<l rend="indent3"> He has no hungry children to claim
                        part</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Of the half meal.</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Traveller</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Tis idleness makes want,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And idle habits. if the man will go</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And spend his wages by the alehouse
                        fire</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Whom can he blame if there is want at
                        home?</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Woman.</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Aye – idleness! the rich folks never
                        fail</l>
<l rend="indent3"> To find some reason why the poor
                        deserve</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Their sufferings. is it idleness I pray
