<p rend="indent1"> We reached this place yesterday, &amp; my
                    first business is to write to you. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</ref> I
                    have not yet seen, for she is visiting a friend at Bath. my
                        <ref target="people.html#HillMargaret">Cousin
                        Margaret</ref> I find yet living – it was her wish to
                    live long enough to see me, – a fatality seems to hang upon
                    my foreign expeditions. at my last return I met the news of
                        <ref target="people.html#LovellRobert">Lovells</ref>
                    death – &amp; now I am arrived to the death bed of one whom
                    I dearly dearly love.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s cousin, <ref target="people.html#HillMargaret">Margaret
                            Hill</ref>.</note> I am afraid that you have but too
                    much reason to understand my feelings by your own.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I am anxious to know my account with you. it
                    will leave me deeply in your debt. my spirits are heavily
                    depressed – nothing but ill tidings greet me. I have
                    purchased health by running in debt – <del rend="strikethrough">the </del>
<ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth"> my Aunt</ref> is
                    more insane than ever, – <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</ref>
                    made wretched by her &amp; half infected by her, – perhaps
                    the fogs &amp; rains physically help to dishearten me. – Yet
                    my own prospects have a sunshine upon them. <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> has
                    proposed to me to go as Secretary with Drummond<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir William Drummond (c.
                        1770-1828; <title>DNB</title>), classical scholar, poet
                        and diplomat; Charge d’Affaires in Denmark 1800-1801,
                        Minister-Plenipotentiary in Naples 1801-1803 and
                        1807-1808, and Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire in
                        1803.</note> to Palermo first – then to Constantinople.
                    if <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> can go
                    with me I joyfully accept the offer – &amp; wait to know.
                    this hurried me from Lisbon where I should else have
                    remained in conformity to <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncles</ref>
                    wishes &amp; to my own. He highly approves the scheme. its
                    immediate advantage is little – but it carries me <hi rend="ital">prudently</hi> to a good climate, &amp;
                    affords a possibility of advancement.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> My plans for the present I will write to you
                    more at large when the tumult of return has a little
                    subsided. <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref>
                    is well &amp; desires her remembrance. we left all well in
                    Lisbon. write to me &amp; believe me</p>
