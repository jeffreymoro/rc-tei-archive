                    I could not get any letter paper here &amp; this when folded in the true
                    batchelorship form will look very respectable at the post office. </p>
<p rend="indent1"> I like your Stork well – &amp; doubt not you will like my motto
                    for it – which is – riddle-my-riddle-my-ree. I can find no better – but I can do
                    what is better – for the device being a true emblem I can make a poem upon it
                    which being put in one volume will serve instead of a motto for all the rest.
                    &amp; I can put you in the Poem – so send me the drawing &amp; I will write in
                    the very spirit of old honest Wither<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">George Wither (1588-1667; <title>DNB</title>), poet, satirist and
                        Parliamentarian soldier during the Civil War.</note> – God rest his soul, he
                    was a fine, sulky stubborn, good-hearted, mutinous Puritan, &amp; tho he was
                    dull his warm heart sometimes heated his imagination &amp; then he did write
                    divinely. I wish you had seen as many Storks as I have. it is the most
                    picturesque of European birds in its habits, stalking in the marshes or flapping
                    homeward at evening to the church tower, or the ruined castle. the nest would
                    cover the top of a pillar completely.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> And now about the Madoc-drawings.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had finished a version of <title>Madoc</title> in
                        1797-1799 and was revising it for publication. It did not appear until
                        1805.</note> I will get the book with the Mexican costumes<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Francisco Javier Clavigero (1731-1787),

                    appearance hand in hand with May – or with April day if you think that would be
                    coupling you suitably. Summer is not the season for the country. <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> says, &amp; says
                    well, that then it is like a theatre at noon, there are no <hi rend="ital">goings on</hi> under a clear sky – but at all other seasons, there is such
                    shifting of shades – such islands of light, such columns &amp; buttresses of
                    sunshine – as ought almost make a painter burn his brushes – as the sorcerers
                    did their books of magic when they saw the divinity which rested upon the
                        apostles.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
<title>Acts of the
                            Apostles</title> 19: 19.</note> The very snow which you would perhaps
                    think must monotonize the mountains, gives new varieties. it brings out their
                    recesses &amp; designates all their inequalities – it impresses a better feeling
                    of their height, &amp; it reflects such tints of saffron – or fawn – or rose
                    colour to the evening sun – O Maria Sanctissima<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The Latin translates as ‘O Mary most holy’. It is the title
                        of a Latin hymn to the Virgin Mary.</note> – Mount Horeb<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">
<title>Exodus</title> 3: 1; the mountain on
                        which Moses received the Ten Commandments.</note> with the glory upon its
                    summit might have been more glorious – but not more beautiful than old Skiddaw
                    in his winter pelice of ermine. I will not quarrel with frost – tho the fellow
                    has the impudence to take me by the nose. the Lake side has such ten thousand
                    charms! a fleece of snow or of the hoar frost lies on the fallen trees of large
                    stones – the grass points that just peer above the water are powdered with
                    diamonds. the ice on the margin with chains of crystal &amp; such veins &amp;
                    wavy lines of beauty as mock all art – &amp; to crown all <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> &amp; I have
                    found out that stones thrown upon the lake when frozen – make a noise like
                    singing birds – &amp; when you whirl on it a large flake of ice, away the
                    shivers slide chirping &amp; warbling like a flight of finches. –</p>
<p rend="indent1"> But once more to the drawings. Madoc is not such a painters poem
                    as Thalaba<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">
<title>Thalaba the
                            Destroyer</title> (1801).</note> tho you doubtless will find out more in
                    it than I can. But it will be possible to make very learned drawings which will
                    be useful. let me see what subject seems practicable. – The blind old man
                    sitting on the smooth stone beside the brook &amp; feeling Madocs face, that
                    will surely do.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">
<title>Madoc</title>
                        (1805), Part 1, Book 3, lines 228-238.</note> – The canoes rowing Madoc over
                    the lake on a floating Island.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">
<title>Madoc</title> (1805), Part 1, Book 6, lines 131-137.</note> –
                    Coanocotzin showing Madoc where the dead Tepilomi stood up against the wall, by
                    devilish art Preserved, &amp; from his black &amp; shrivelled hand The steady
                    lamp hung down.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">
<title>Madoc</title>
                        (1805), Part 1, Book 6, lines 249-252.</note> I cannot find any other
                    passage as yet that is picture-fit. The interest is more internal than in
                    Thalaba. The intellect is more addressed than the eye. it has more to do with
                    feeling than with fancy. However I shall read it over with you, &amp; then we
                    will see with both our pair of eyes at once – Senhora I conceive two sets of
                    eyes to see more clearly than one &amp; a pair of spectacles.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I should be very much fretted if I had not determined never to
                    suffer any manufactory of fiddlestrings in my inside. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">my youngest brother</ref>, of whom you
                    have always heard me prophesy ill, is playing the Devil. he has left his ship –
                    is living with some stranger<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors"> John
                        Barham Foster-Barham (1763-1822), a wealthy merchant in the West India trade
                        and partner in Plummer, Barham &amp; Co. How Edward Southey had made his
                        acquaintance is unclear.</note> at Exeter – running in debt – &amp; taking
                    up money in my name – &amp; thus at the age of fifteen. Of course I have
                    protested his drafts &amp; refused to pay his bills – &amp; he &amp; his new
                    friend &amp; his accursed <ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">Aunt</ref>
                    (who it seems advised him to quit the navy &amp; has since quarrelled with him)
                    may settle the scrape how they can. If ever I write my life the family anecdotes
                    will be exceedingly amusing – like the history of the plagues of Egypt<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">
<title>Exodus</title> 7-12. The ten
                        plagues visited on the Egyptians for refusing to let the Israelites
                        leave.</note> to those who have no concern in them. I have made up a theory
                    upon the process of family diseases which will stand test I think. – how all
                    oddities are different appearances of some intellectual affection – some disease
                    or disorganization of the brain – &amp; that if mine had not broken out in
                    poetry – I should have been an Evangelical in sad sober earnest – &amp; perhaps
                    have sprouted prophecies in Moor-fields.<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">Moorfields was an open area in London that became a site for Methodist
                        preaching, especially in the Tabernacle, first constructed in 1741.</note>
</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Fare you well. you see I am in good spirits. in plain verity I
                    will not be cast down for what man can do. When God afflicts me it is for wise
                    purposes – &amp; I bow &amp; suffer &amp; am the better. But whenever the folly
                    or depravity of any person with whom it is my misfortune to be connected, annoys
                    me – I feel it as an insult – &amp; permit resentment to prevail in me, as the
