<p rend="indent5"> ____</p>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> Jaspar was poor, &amp; want &amp;
                            vice</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Had made his heart like stone,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And Jaspar lookd with envious
                            eyes</l>
<l rend="indent4"> On riches not his own.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> On plunder bent abroad he went </l>
<l rend="indent4"> Towards the close of day,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And loitered on the lonely road</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Impatient for his prey.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> No traveller came, he loitered
                            long</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And often lookd around,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And pausd &amp; listened eagerly </l>
<l rend="indent4"> To catch some coming sound.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> He sat him down beside the stream</l>
<l rend="indent4"> That crost the lonely way; –</l>
<l rend="indent3"> So fair a scene might well have
                            charmd</l>
<l rend="indent4"> All evil thoughts away.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> He sat beneath a willow tree</l>
<l rend="indent4"> That cast a trembling shade,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> The gentle river full in front</l>
<l rend="indent4"> A little island made,</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> Where pleasantly the moon-beam
                            shone</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Upon the poplar trees,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Whose shadow on the stream below</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Playd slowly to the breeze.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> He listend – &amp; he heard the
                            wind</l>
<l rend="indent4"> That waved the willow tree,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> He heard the waters flow along</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And murmur quietly.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> He listened for the travellers tread
                            –</l>
<l rend="indent4"> The nightingale sung sweet;</l>
<l rend="indent3"> He started up, for now he heard</l>
<l rend="indent4"> The sound of coming feet.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> He started up &amp; graspt a
                            stake</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And waited for his prey,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> There came a lonely traveller,</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And Jaspar crost his way.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> But Jaspars threats &amp; curses
                            faild</l>
<l rend="indent4"> The traveller to appal,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> He would not lightly yield the
                            purse</l>
<l rend="indent4"> That held his little all.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> Awhile he struggled, but he
                            strove</l>
<l rend="indent4"> With Jaspars strength in vain,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Beneath his blows he fell &amp;
                            groand</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And never spake again.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> He lifted up the murdered man</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And plunged him in the flood,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And in the running waters then</l>
<l rend="indent4"> He cleansed his hands from blood</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> The waters closed around the
                            corpse</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And cleansed his hands from gore,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> The willow waved, the stream flowd
                            on</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And murmurd as before.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> There was no human eye had seen</l>
<l rend="indent4"> The blood the murderer spilt,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And Jaspars conscience never knew</l>
<l rend="indent4"> The avenging goad of guilt.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> But soon the ruffian had consumd </l>
<l rend="indent4"> The gold he gaind so ill,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And years of secret guilt past on</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And he was needy still.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> One eve beside the alehouse fire</l>
<l rend="indent4"> He sat as it befell,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> When in there came a labouring
                            man</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Whom Jaspar knew full well.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> He sat him down by Jaspars side</l>
<l rend="indent4"> A melancholy man,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> For spite of honest toil, the
                            world</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Went hard with Jonathan.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> His toil a little earnd; &amp; he </l>
<l rend="indent4"> With little was content,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> But sickness on his wife had
                            fallen</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And all he had was spent.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> Then with his wife &amp; little
                            ones</l>
<l rend="indent4"> He shared his scanty meal,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And saw their looks of
                            wretchedness</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And felt what wretches feel.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> That very morn the Landlords
                            power</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Had seized the little left,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And now the sufferer found
                            himself</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Of every thing bereft.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> He lent his head upon his hand</l>
<l rend="indent4"> His elbow on his knee,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And so by Jaspars side he sat,</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And not a word said he.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> Nay – why so downcast? Jaspar cried
                            –</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Come cheer up Jonathan!</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Drink neighbour – drink – twill warm
                            thy heart</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Come come – take courage man.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> He took the cup that Jaspar gave</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And down he draind it quick;</l>
<l rend="indent3"> I have a wife, said Jonathan</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And she is deadly sick.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> She has no bed to lie upon –</l>
<l rend="indent4"> I saw them take her bed –</l>
<l rend="indent3"> I have three children – would to
                            God</l>
<l rend="indent4"> That they &amp; I were dead.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> Our Landlord he goes home to
                            night</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And he will sleep in peace;</l>
<l rend="indent3"> I would that I were in my grave</l>
<l rend="indent4"> For there all troubles cease!</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> In vain I prayd him to forbear </l>
<l rend="indent4"> Tho wealth enough has he.–</l>
<l rend="indent3"> God be to him as merciless</l>
<l rend="indent4"> As he has been to me!</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> When Jaspar saw the poor mans
                            soul</l>
<l rend="indent4"> On all his ills intent,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> He plied him with the heartening
                            cup</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And with him forth he went.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> This Landlord on his homeward
                            road</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Twere easy now to meet;</l>
<l rend="indent3"> The road is lonesome Jonathan!</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And vengeance man, is sweet.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> He listened to the tempters voice</l>
<l rend="indent4"> The thought it made him start –</l>
<l rend="indent3"> His head was hot, &amp;
                            wretchedness</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Had hardened now his heart.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> Along the lonely road they went</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And waited for their prey,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> They sat them down beside the
                            stream</l>
<l rend="indent4"> That crost the lonely way.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> They sat them down beside the
                            stream</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And never a word they said,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> They sat &amp; listened silently</l>
<l rend="indent4"> To hear the travellers tread.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> The night was calm, the night was
                            dark,</l>
<l rend="indent4"> No star was in the sky,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> The wind it waved the willow
                            boughs,</l>
<l rend="indent4"> The stream flowed quietly.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> The night was calm, the air was
                            still,</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Sweet sung the nightingale,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> The soul of Jonathan was soothd</l>
<l rend="indent4"> His heart began to fail.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> Tis weary waiting here, he cried</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And now the hour is late,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Methinks he will not come to night
                            –</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Tis useless more to wait.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> Have patience man! the ruffian
                            said</l>
<l rend="indent4"> A little we may wait,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> But longer shall his wife expect</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Her husband at the gate.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> Then Jonathan grew sick at heart,</l>
<l rend="indent4"> My conscience yet is clear –</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Jaspar it is not yet too late –</l>
<l rend="indent4"> I will not linger here.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> How now! cried Jaspar. why I
                            thought</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Thy conscience was asleep!</l>
<l rend="indent3"> No more such qualms. the night is
                            dark</l>
<l rend="indent4"> The river here is deep.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> What matters that, said Jonathan</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Whose blood began to freeze,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> When there is one above whose eye</l>
<l rend="indent4"> The deeds of darkness sees.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> We’re safe enough, said Jaspar
                            then</l>
<l rend="indent4"> If that be all thy fear,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Nor eye below, nor eye above</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Can pierce the darkness here.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> That instant as the Murderer
                            spake</l>
<l rend="indent4"> There came a sudden light,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Strong as the midday sun it shone</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Tho all around was night.</l>
<lb/>
<l rend="indent3"> It hung upon the willow tree</l>
<l rend="indent4"> It hung upon the flood,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> It gave to view the poplar isle</l>
