<p rend="indent1"> I go to London on May day, which happens on a Wednesday. if it
                    will be in time, your journals had better be carried to London by me, than sent
                    to Portsmouth where there is a possibility of their being lost. we shall, you
                    see, meet in London. I have the whole month of May to pass there or in its
                    neighbourhood, circumstances will determine whether I shall <del rend="strikethrough">be with</del> remain the whole of that time in London
                    or pass one fortnight at Cambridge with <ref target="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</ref>,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Lloyd had been
                        admitted as a fellow-commoner at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, on
                        31 August 1798.</note> to which the wish to be at the College Libraries
                    induces me, but your stay in town will in a great measure regulate mine, <del rend="strikethrough">or</del> tell me all about this – that is as much as
                    you know about it.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I this day send off two Letters<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The second edition of Southey’s <title>Letters Written During
                            a Short Residence in Spain and Portugal</title>, published in

                        published in 1798.</note> we will keep for you, the gleaning volume,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>Annual Anthology</title>, the
                        first volume of which appeared in 1799.</note> which you heard me mention
                    &amp; of which I expect to furnish nearly half, will soon go to the press, –
                    that is in about three weeks. &amp; – that you may have all my literary history
                    at once – the eleventh book of Madoc is begun;<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey completed a fifteen-book version of
                            <title>Madoc</title> in 1797–1799; however, he revised the poem heavily
                        before its publication in 1805.</note> I have fixed upon a dramatic subject
                    &amp; just commenced the first scene. this is my reviewing time, &amp; that must
                    be cleared off before any other employment can be pursued with spirit. I have
                    also an octavo volume in hand, which you have heard me speak of, the Analysis of
                    Obscure Epic Poems.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The ‘Analysis’ never
                        appeared.</note> this will be the most disinterested of my labours, as I
                    expect only to sell a small edition, but it will be valuable now, &amp; daily
                    becoming more so, as the books which it will rescue from utter oblivion daily
                    become scarcer. criticisms will be scattered thro it, the compressed narration
                    of each poem will not be uninteresting, there will be many translations, &amp;
                    perhaps sometimes when I see a fine subject massacred I may throw off a passage
                    of my own to show what could have been made of it. this volume is my idle work –
                    I read the necessary books as my leisure reading – &amp; have my paper lying
                    open before me.</p>
