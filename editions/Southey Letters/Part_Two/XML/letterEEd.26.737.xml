<p rend="indent1"> I thought you would know from <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> that I
                    trespass on my eyes only for short letters – or from <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref> to whom

                    this have received Kehama.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
<title>The Curse of Kehama</title>
                        (1810). Southey had begun drafting Book 2 on 4 June
                        1802.</note> they have been better &amp; are again worse
                    – in spite of lapis calaminaris<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Calamine.</note> – goulard<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Goulard’s extract, a
                        solution of lead acetate and lead oxide, used as an
                        astringent.</note> – cayenne pepper – &amp; the surgeons
                    lance. but they will soon be well so I believe &amp;
                    trust.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> You have seen my Cid<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had transcribed for Wynn material
                        relating to Rodrigo Diaz de Bivar (c. 1040-1099), a
                        Castilian aristocrat and military commander, whose
                        exploits were the subject of numerous poems and tales.
                        Southey’s English translation and compilation of three
                        of these was published in 1808 as <title>The Chronicle
                            of the Cid</title>.</note> – &amp; have not seen
                    what I wrote to <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> about its manner. everywhere where possible
                    the story is told in the very phrase of the original
                    chronicles which are almost the oldest works in the
                    Castilian language. <del rend="strikethrough">this
                        song</del> the language in itself poetical becomes more
                    poetical by necessary compression – if it smack of romance –
                    so does the story. in the notes the certain will be
                    distinguished from the doubtful, passages quoted, &amp;
                    references to author &amp; page uniformly given. Thus much
                    for this which is no specimen of my historical style. indeed
                    I do not think uniformity of style desirable – it should
                    rise &amp; fall with the subject &amp; adapt itself to the
                    matter. moreover in my own judgement a little peculiarity of
                    style is desirable, because it nails down the matter to the
                    memory – you remember the facts of Livy – but you remember
                    the very phrase of Tacitus &amp; Sallust,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Three Roman historians:
                        Titus Livius (59BC-17AD), author of <title>From the
                            Founding of the City</title>; Publius Cornelius
                        Tacitus (56-117 AD), author of <title>Histories</title>
                        and <title>Annals</title>; Gaius Sallustius Crispus
                        (86-34 BC), author of <title>The Conspiracy of
                            Catiline</title> and the <title>Jugurthine
                            War</title>.</note> &amp; the phrase reminds you of
                    the matter when it would else have been forgotten. this may
                    be pushed like every thing else too far &amp; become
                    ridiculous but the principle is true. </p>
<p rend="indent1"> As a different specimen I wish you could see
                    a life of S. Francisco<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">St Francis (1181/2-1226), founder of the
                        Franciscan order. All these ‘specimens’ were drafts of
                        parts of Southey’s unfinished ‘History of
                        Portugal’.</note> – a section upon Mohammedanism – &amp;
                    a chapter upon the Moorish period. Oh these eyes! these
                    eyes! to have my brain in labour &amp; this spell to prevent
                    delivery like a damned cross-legged Juno!<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Roman goddess of marriage
                        and childbirth.</note> – farewell till tomorrow – I must

<p rend="indent1"> Your story of <ref target="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppa</ref> &amp; the
                    Apples is an excellent story – &amp; your note is a good

                    has a poem upon one – </p>

<p rend="indent1"> Another tempter of the Snake – <note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was mistaken: these
                        lines are not by Abraham Cowley (1618-1667;
                            <title>DNB</title>), but by Edmund Waller
                        (1606-1687; <title>DNB</title>), ‘To a Fair Lady,

<p>They <hi rend="ital">ought</hi> to be tamed &amp; taken into
                    our service. for snakes eat mice – &amp; can get into their
                    holes after them – &amp; in our country the venomous species
                    is so rare that we should think them beautiful animals were
                    it not for a recollection of the old Serpent. <hi rend="ital">When</hi> I am housed &amp; <hi rend="ital">homed</hi> (as by the blessing of God I shall be – or
                    hope to be in the next Spring – not that the negociation is

                    shall have a house in the loveliest part of South Wales – in
                    a vale between high mountains – &amp; an onymous house too
                    Grosvenor – &amp; one that is down in the map of

                    moreover an Otter &amp; teach him to fish – for there is
                    salmon in the river Neath, &amp; I should like a hawk – but
                    that is only a vain hope – &amp; a gull or an osprey to fish
                    in the sea &amp; I will have a snake – if <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> will let

                    Grosvenor when you come to visit me – N.B. you will arrive
