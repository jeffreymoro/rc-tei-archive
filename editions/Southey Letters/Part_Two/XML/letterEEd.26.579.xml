                    in the grand view – in the comprehensive scale – I do affirm
                    it – &amp; that with no mental reservation – not from any
                    vanity, any justifiable pride in the possession – how did I

                    seven leagues distant in that direction – &amp; the league
                    is four English miles – tho sometimes it may be eight – but
                    these leagues are to be computed at four – do you not see a
                    ridge of mountains? the Serra de Monchique? there I have
                    been – &amp; your finger is now within half an inch of a
                    town about a league below the very cacumen of the sierra –
                    it is the town of Monchique – you have it – &amp; that is
                    his name. It is a pity Grosvenor that your eye could not
                    actually &amp; occularly be in that spot – &amp; that you
                    did not ascend upon a jack ass with me to the Foye, &amp;
                    look around you – &amp; behold a prospect where the eye was
                    bounded only by its own weakness. There Grosvenor was he
                    born. &amp; it is a very Paradise – woods – waters – all
                    that is soothing – all that is magnificent. there is a
                    rain-manufactory upon the summit – &amp; I had a sample of
                    the raw materials. but so it was – I was deadly hungry. how
                    should it be otherwise? we had had much to do &amp; little
                    to eat – &amp; I had not then caught the Tortoise – who is
                    coming to England with me – so that we had nothing in store
                    in case of famine – &amp; at Monchique there were fowls. we
                    did not steal them Grosvenor – they were bought &amp;
                    picked, &amp; spitted upon the small cane – spits Grosvenor
                    are little in use where roasting is unknown. </p>
<p rend="indent1"> But the sight of the meat – for tho fish
                    flesh &amp; fowl are three distinct denominations, yet
                    assuredly fowl must be allowed to be flesh, &amp; meat is a
                    name common to both – that sight – the recollected hunger
                    affects my appetite. there sate Bento<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Portuguese servant.</note>
                    turning by hand the cane – &amp; the savour of the roast
                    offering arose, &amp; the nose having the first fruits,
                    tantalized the mouth by its imperfect enjoyment. He also
                    smelt it, &amp; he came, perhaps led by curiosity – for a
                    roast fowl was a thing unheard of in the town – perhaps led
                    by the nose. not in the dancing bear way, but by the silken
                    threads which Nature has given Instinct to rein us. </p>
<p rend="indent1">
<hi rend="ital">Sta pronta</hi>, which is being translated –
                    it is ready! the knife &amp; fork came from the pocket –
                    they were seperated – opened – wiped – ready. there he
                    stood. In a Catholic &lt;country&gt; it may be doubted
                    whether to have given him <del rend="strikethrough">food</del> &lt;meat&gt; on a fast day had been
                    allowable – this was not a fast day – it was <del rend="strikethrough">Tuesday</del> Monday April 20.
                    &amp; I had reason for imagining that he was no Catholic,
                    tho born &amp; bred among Papists. indeed the fact<del rend="strikethrough">s</del> is that the Priests had
                    never attempted to instruct him, he had too much sense to be
                    imposed upon – &amp; this they knew. We were feasting &amp;
                    there he stood – in a posture of attentive supplication –
                    all upon the watch – ears – eyes – (beautiful eyes –) nose –
                    lips –, from one end to the other, &amp; there was the shape
                    of one end </p>
<p rend="center">[Southey inserts a large C]</p>
<p>from which figure it is apparent that tho a point be the fit
                    ending for an epigram it is not for all other things. We
                    gave him – no matter what. it was enough – it what became us
                    to bestow &amp; him to receive. there was no stipulation, it
                    was on our part a free gift – not a price. no return was
                    expected – indeed none was deserved. but he went home &amp;
                    his dreams were of the fowl, &amp; what a happiness it were
                    to live with an Englishman. &amp; the next morning he arose,
                    &amp; forsook all &amp; followed us.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I immediately saw that he was – but there was
                    no one to whom I could communicate the discovery till I had
                    reached Lisbon, &amp; that was a laborious journey of nine
                    &lt;days&gt; going by Lagos, &amp; Sagres &amp; the Cape.
                    yet it occurred to me often with emotions of solitary
                    triumph, &amp; if my pleasure was increased by looking on to
                    your consequent mortification, impute it to the constitution
                    of our nature, not to the selfishness of the individual.
                    what one gains another must lose. certainly I am proud that
                    he is – for certainly he is – indeed, he is. &amp; on my
                    return to Lisbon I asked <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> if he was
                    not – &amp; she affirmed it – not that I needed her
                    testimony to fix my own faith. the fact was obvious. the eye
                    assents to it as the mind to a mathematical axiom, not from
                    volition – not from the result of reasoning, but from the
                    feeling, the palpable perception of truth. </p>

                    proportion, &amp; clouted cream to eat with both – it
                    follows that the largest is preferable – I love Gooseberry
