<salute>My dear friend</salute>

<p rend="indent1"> The more I talk or think of the house at Richmond the more I am
                    disposed to have the bargain concluded, that is, if the inside be tolerably
                    convenient, which there should seem little reason to doubt. the taxes indeed are
                    very high, but they must bear nearly the same proportion to rent every where in
                    the neighbourhood of London. if you can get sight of the premises &amp; find
                    them comfortably habitable, as doubtless they must be, I shall be very glad to
                    take it for a term &amp; have every thing settled the sooner the better. then if
                    any unforeseen circumstance prevents us from getting this we may lose no time in
                    looking out for another.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I was heartily glad to reach home after the labour of
                    perambulating London every day for a fortnight. that fortnight seems longer than
                    the twelve months which preceded it, &amp; I relapse right gladly to my regular
                    every day uniformity of scene, society &amp; action. but this is lazy weather,
                    too hot to go abroad &amp; almost to do any thing at home. – I feel very much
                    like a Portugueze &amp; could make a siesta of all day long. it would be an
                    improvement to live like the Owls by night at this season. All Bristol is up in
                    arms &amp; volunteering – cool sport for the dog days! the Duke of
                        Cumberland<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Prince Ernest Augustus
                        (1771-1851), fifth son of George III. Later King of Hanover 1837-1851. A
                        competent soldier, he held the rank of lieutenant-general and was Military
                        District Commander of the Severn area.</note> is to be here to day to form a
                    camp upon Leigh Down – luckily there is the river between but that camp will
                    spoil the loveliest walks in this neighbourhood or perhaps in this country. all
                    this however is very necessary. a few weeks more &amp; England will be in a
                    formidable state of preparation. if they arm the people as is talked of<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The Army of Reserve Acts (1803) provided
                        for a new Army of Reserve to defend Britain from invasion. If any parish
                        could not provide enough volunteers there was a ballot of all the adult male
                        parishioners. The government also called for a new volunteer force to harass
                        any invading French army.</note> I think I can foresee much good to arise
                    out of the present evil. a system more favourable to the morals &amp; security
                    &amp; liberties of the country than that of militias &amp; standing armies.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> The letter you sent me contained little more than a message &amp;
                    a note of introduction to the Duke of Bedford,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford (1766-1839;
                            <title>DNB</title>), Whig politician.</note> which would have been of no
                    use had it arrived before my departure.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> On my return I had a formidable campaign of letter-writing to
                    commence – chiefly de Bibliothecâ.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">A plan
                        for a chronological account of literature written in Britain, which Longman
                        and Rees abandoned in August 1803.</note> to announce the plan &amp; seek
                    associates. this labour which of all others is the most unprofitable &amp; the
                    least pleasurable, is by no means over yet. the plan becomes daily more
                    methodized in my head, &amp; I recollect &amp; discover more sources of
                    information than at first occurred. I perceive that the great art of my
                    Generalship will be to do nothing beneath my Commanderships dignity – to make
                    others pioneer &amp; work in the trenches &amp; to waste no toil upon what may
                    be executed quite as well &amp; in all probability better by my Sergeants &amp;
                    Corporals. this is particularly the case with regard to examining manuscripts –
                    after I had mastered the difficulty of deciphering their characters the expence
                    of time &amp; eyesight would be more than I ought to afford. my business must be
                    to make others hew in the quarry &amp; erect the building myself. My old &amp;
                    ugly stall-gleanings are all now turning to account – I call them my Ducks –
                    dirty – but good. in turning over these venerables you would be surprized to see
                    how much I find that bears upon biography – or the general history of manners
                    &amp; science. it delights me to think of resetting the pearls that have lain so
                    long in the dunghill – shall I not have a claim upon the Humane Society<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The Royal Humane Society, founded in 1774,
                        offered rewards to those who helped save the lives of people in danger of
                        drowning.</note> for recovering smothered Authors to life?</p>

<ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaretEdithdau">Your goddaughter</ref> had cut
                    three teeth during my absence at the expence of some indisposition. I wish she
                    slept more &amp; dreamt less. her little brain is never at rest. all day she is
                    full of life &amp; good humour – but at night the least sound wakens her. <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> is very well – tho she
                    grumbles at the hot weather, which seems to agree with none but me &amp; the
