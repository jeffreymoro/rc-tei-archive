<p rend="indent1"> Savary<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">John Savary (d.
                        1831), a banker based in Bristol.</note> is willing to take <ref target="people.html#FrickerGeorge">George</ref> into his bank, if you &amp;
                    I will become his bondsmen, bound for 500 £ each. the situation is thought a
                    favourable one. it is for seven years – at a salary of 12 £ the first – 15 the
                    second, &amp; increasing 5£ every succeeding year – at the expiration of that
                    time he is calculated for any situation which requires accomptant knowledge. to
                    be bound for the good conduct of any body is always hazardous &amp; never wise,
                    but it is sometimes right – &amp; so I conceive it to be in the present case.
                    write me your opinion – &amp; that as soon as you can that Savary may be
                    answered. the obvious advantage of the situation is that he will be receiving
                    something towards his maintenance during this apprenticeship; its objection that
                    it leads, in all likelihood, only to a bare support. but it must be remembered
                    that <ref target="people.html#FrickerGeorge">George</ref> is very slow, &amp;
                    therefore unlikely to forward himself in any way of life – &amp; this neither
                    requires premium now, not capital hereafter.</p>

                    ways &amp; means must be supplied – for the ensuing year I look to Thalaba.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">

                        unfinished and unpublished until 1816.</note> on that account. you will want
                    all your time – &amp; I suspect more, – &amp; much as I should like the poem I
                    can do without it &amp; feel no inconvenience. if you publish your letters you
                    will of course insert the Brocken lines; these therefore I will remove from the
