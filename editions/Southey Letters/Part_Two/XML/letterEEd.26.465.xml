<p rend="indent1"> I had hardly patience to copy for you this miserable version of
                    what certainly is a fine story.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The
                        enclosed poem has not survived and cannot be identified.</note> it must be
                    rewritten – &amp; on a different plan. the story is not like Lord William &amp;
                        Rudiger<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s ballads, ‘Lord
                        William’, <title>Morning Post,</title> 16 March 1798, and ‘Rudiger’,
                            <title>Poems</title> (Bristol, 1797), pp. 175–186.</note> – <del rend="strikethrough">xx</del> in which the effect of the whole is to be
                    attended to – &amp; not the working up of all the parts. this should be written
                    more at length – the parts made more distinct &amp; finished highly. read it
                    &amp; burn it.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I will try to manufacture something better. the demonical story
                    is curious – I do not recognize the superstition in any other story.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The ‘demonical story’ cannot be identified from
                        the information in Southey’s letter.</note> witches had not to my knowledge
                    the power of transporting so unmercifully – I thought it had been peculiar to
                    Scotch judges, &amp; French Directors.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">In
                        1793–1794, five British radicals were sentenced to be transported to
                        Australia after trial in Scotland. The French Directory (1795–1799)
                        preferred to exile opponents to French Guiana.</note> perhaps one day the
                    circumstance may ferment into a ballad – but I see not how at present. the tale
                    from Sully<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Maximilien de Bethune, Duc de
                        Sully (1560–1641), <title>Memoires</title> (1638–1662).</note> I suppose
                    gave Dryden or Lee the hint for <del rend="strikethrough">xxxx</del> &lt;the&gt;
                    Duke of Guise<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">John Dryden (1631–1700;
                            <title>DNB</title>) and Nathaniel Lee (1653–1692; <title>DNB</title>),
                            <title>The Duke of Guise. A Tragedy</title> (1682).</note> – &amp; if
                    so, is the remote cause of a simile in Joan of Arc blundered up from Rabadan the
                    Spanish Moor<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Muhammad Rabadan,
                        <title>Mahometism Fully Explained</title> (1723–1725), trans. Joseph Morgan (fl.
                        1720s); cited in the notes to <title>Thalaba the
                            Destroyer</title> (1801). Rabadan was a Spanish Muslim (fl. 1603) who
                        ended his life in exile in Tunis. The ‘simile’ was from <title>Joan of
                            Arc</title> (1796), Book 4, lines 245–252 and concerned the effect
                        produced by a visit from Azrael, Angel of Death; see Robert Southey to
                        Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, 16 August 1797, <title>The Collected Letters
                            of Robert Southey. Part 1</title>, Letter 249.</note> &amp; that play
                    when I had nothing to refer to. The Dog is a good tale.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey possibly alludes to his letter to Wynn, 28 November
                        [1799] (Letter 457). This cited the story that in France in c. 1400, the
                        Chevalier Maquer murdered a man called Montdidier. Montdidier’s greyhound
                        found the corpse and accused Maquer by attacking him. In a trial by combat
                        between the man and the dog, Maquer was overpowered, confessed to his crime
                        and was executed; see <title>Common-Place Book</title>, ed. John Wood
                        Warter, 4 series (London, 1849–1850), IV, p. 197.</note>
</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Pausanias &amp; Cleonice<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Pausanias (d. c. 470 BC) was a Spartan general and regent. He accidentally
                        killed Cleonice, a young virgin of Byzantium, and was haunted by her spirit;
                        see <title>Common-Place Book</title>, ed. John Wood Warter, 4 series
                        (London, 1849–1850), IV, p. 163.</note> is the Greek story that strikes me
                    as fit for a wild poem. there is another in Pausanias of Euthymus fighting a
                    Demon &amp; delivering a damsel.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Euthymus of Locris (fl. 484–472 BC) was a famous boxer; Pausanias (2nd
                        century AD), <title>Description of Greece</title>, Book 6, chapter 6 tells
                        the story of how he defeated a demon who was troubling the people of
                        Temessa; see <title>Common-Place Book</title>, ed. John Wood Warter, 4
                        series (London, 1849–1850), IV, pp. 226–227.</note> But I succeed best
                    either in trifles of this class – as Bruno &amp; Hatto &amp; the Well of St
                        Keyne<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">‘Bishop Bruno’, <title>Morning

                            <title>Morning Post</title>, 17 November 1799; ‘The Well of St. Keyne’,
                            <title>Morning Post</title>, 3 December 1798.</note> – or in narration
                    of more length where there is room to develope character &amp; feeling.</p>
