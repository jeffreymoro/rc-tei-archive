<p rend="indent1"> Now that my arrangements pro tempore<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The Latin translates
                        as ‘for the time being’.</note> are concluded, it is
                    time to dispatch intelligence to my friends. You remember
                        <ref target="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers’s</ref>
                    house. We have taken one in the same row − the whole −
                    furnished − at a guinea &amp; half per week. so much room is
                    necessary as <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> expects to be confined in the course of the
                        summer.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The
                        Southeys’ first child, <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaretEdithdau">Margaret Edith</ref>, was born on 31 August
                        1802.</note> the situation is good, &amp; the almost
                    next door neighbourhood of a friend every way desirable.
                    this evening we take possession − I shall at least have
                    leisure to do much here. after my thousand &amp; one
                    acquaintance in London I feel as secluded here as in a
                    convent.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Our journey was cheap. four &amp; twenty
                    hours for three &amp; twenty shillings. what a bargain if
                    the coach had been as long again upon the road! I find some
                    good books arrived for me from Lisbon. two of the oldest
                    &amp; rarest chronicles − the best book upon Abyssinia −
                    &amp; the whole monastic history of the kingdom &amp; its

</p>
<p rend="indent1"> You will soon I hope be able to send me
                    intelligence from the <ref target="people.html#CorryIsaac">Chancellor</ref>. I left him a note the morning of our
                    departure. I am well pleased that our connection should end
                    − not but any foolish office is desirable with such a salary
                    annexed − but I am weary of vagabonding about − &amp; have
                    now a pressing motive for settling. Nor can I &amp; my books
                    afford to be so seperated any longer. I should now be half a
                    dozen times in the course of a day in your house, if the
                    Devil would carry me there, or I could ride a broomstick.
                    About the where of my abiding place there is little
                    hesitation. Bristol has not enough society. for that Norwich
                    is the best place − but the neighbourhood of London allows a
                    readier intercourse <del rend="strikethrough">of</del> with
                    booksellers − &amp; in ceasing to be a Secretary I must
                    become a Scribbler. My stay here − or at least <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Ediths</ref> − if it
                    should please the Powers above to whistle me over to <ref target="places.html#Dublin">Dublin</ref> − cannot be
                    less than four months − I expect that your definitive
                    intelligence will enable me to commission <ref target="people.html#MayJohn">John May</ref> to have his
                    eye upon the small houses around Richmond, &amp; secure me
                    one at Michaelmas. He fixes me to that neighbourhood. One
                    friend within a half hours walk is among the necessaries of
                    life.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I met <ref target="people.html#PooleThomas">Poole</ref> here on his way to France − &amp; desired
                    that he would make <ref target="people.html#DavyHumphry">Davy</ref> take him to you. he is a man whom you will
                    like to converse with − for his pursuits have been chiefly
                    agriculture &amp; political oeconomy. he is self-taught,
                    &amp; his mind powerful, active &amp; discriminating.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> The Pneumatic Institution continues. the name
                    should be changed<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">In

                        Poor.</note> − as they do little with the gasses − on
                    account chiefly of the expence of experiments. <ref target="people.html#BeddoesThomas">Beddoes</ref> now

                    a very able man − with a hand of dexterity almost as
                    convertible as yours. their patients are very numerous. they
                    sometimes succeed in curing early consumption by the

                    saw <ref target="people.html#BeddoesThomas">Beddoes</ref>.
                    the old medical language fits his character admirably − he
                    is of nature cold &amp; dry. it is to be lamented that they
                    have not pursued pneumatic experiments steadily. the gasses
                    act so immediately &amp; powerfully that they should appear
                    to be great agents in medicine.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Do you know anything − that is have you ever
                    thought anything about the production of mushrooms? I want
                    to have a method discovered of producing them in great
                    quantities − because they contain more nutriment than any
                    vegetable substance − &amp; appear to need no manure. &amp;
                    besides they are excellent in a hundred ways. The world
                    wants some Epicure to turn Chemist − &amp; give us a
                    scientific book of cookery. I dream of a thousand things
                    which I could do if settled in a house in the country with a
                    garden.</p>
