<salute>My dear Wynn</salute>
</opener>
<p rend="indent1"> I have been looking for a letter from you
                    with vain expectation. Of you I heard by a brother of Sir
                    John Russell,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">There
                        was nobody called Sir John Russell alive in 1800. But it
                        is possible Southey meant Lord John Russell (1766–1839;
                            <title>DNB</title>), later 6th Duke of Bedford, and
                        the brother he met in Portugal was Lord William Russell
                        (1767–1840), MP for Surrey 1789–1807 and Tavistock
                        1807–1820, 1826–1831.</note> a man who has picked up all
                    the pertness &amp; vanity which you know may be acquired at
                    Eton &amp; at Christ-Church. – I have a craving after
                    society, or the <hi rend="ital">possibility</hi> of society,
                    which you will hardly comprehend: insomuch that I begin to
                    assent to the Catholic opinion that the Ear is the most
                    valuable of our senses. – Of the Ferrol Expedition<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The British government
                        was increasingly convinced that Spain would ally with
                        France and declare war on Britain. As a pre-emptive
                        strike, a fleet under the command of Rear-Admiral Sir
                        John Borlase Warren (1753–1822; <title>DNB</title>)
                        unsuccessfully attempted to capture the Spanish port of
                        Ferrol on 25–27 August 1800.</note> you will know more
                    than this could tell you. the Pestilence with which we are
                    threatened is to us a more interesting speculation. It is
                    believed to be the Yellow Fever imported from the Havannah,
                    &amp; improved by transplantation into the Black Vomit, a
                    disease which has more than once ravaged this country. It
                    has extended from Cadiz over all Andalusia. as yet Lisbon
                    has escaped, God knows how! but unless a stop be put to the
                    progress of the contagion by the rains, it must I think <del rend="strikethrough">infall</del> inevitably reach us.
                    We talk of this with more coolness than you will hear of it.
                    If danger approaches we shall fly – but not I think to
                    England. more probably to the north of Portugal, to some
                    little town or village among the mountains: the cause of our
                    flight would be painful, but a residence entirely among the
                    natives would be useful &amp; pleasant, &amp; as I should in
                    fixing have an eye to some Convent Library, I know not
                    whether on the whole this migration be not desirable. so is
                    it that individuals profit by public calamity. Thus have we
                    War &amp; Pestilence at hand, &amp; perhaps Famine at no
                    great distance. There is not forage in the country for three
                    months, &amp; if war be declared against the Northern
                        powers<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The Second
                        League of Armed Neutrality, or League of the North, had
                        been formed in 1800 by Denmark, Prussia, Sweden and
                        Russia to oppose the British fleet’s policy of searching
                        neutral ships to prevent trade with France.</note> or
                    the contagion reaches us, either circumstance will cut off
                    its supplies of wheat from Lisbon, &amp; no other means of
                    applying for their daily bread will be left the inhabitants
                    of that city – than the Pater Noster. Luckily the Provinces
                    will not suffer. the importation of corn is only for Lisbon.
                    the country supplies itself: &amp; among the mountains
                    Pestilence &amp; Famine will protect us from War.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> The four concluding books of Thalaba are
                    transcribed for you, &amp; wait only an opportunity to
                    embark for England. the conclusion of the eleventh &amp; the
                    first half of the twelfth I have since rewritten – from the
                    Simorgs speech to the actual descent. I send you the lines
                    as originally written, &amp; will transmit the substituted
                    ones by letter. In the conclusion of the eighth book these
                    lines are inserted, which are necessary to the after
                        story.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">With few

                        sketch of the play is dated ‘Westbury, April 1799’, but

                    dramatic poetry are I think just &amp; learnt in the good
                    old school. the story is assuredly unhackneyed –

                    his martyrs differ as widely from mine, as my religion does
                    from his. the characters are distinctly marked in my mind –
                    yet I set about it with a fear &amp; a diffidence which I
                    never felt at undertaking any thing before. dramatic writing
                    is an effort of reasoning; a continued effort. the dramatic

<p>Portugal consumes a prodigious quantity of gunpowder &amp;
                    that in the best possible way – in fireworks. there are
                    fraternities belonging to every church who have every year a
                    festival lasting some days – more or less according to the
                    round they take. last week Our Lady of the Incarnation had
                    her holydays at <ref target="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</ref>. the brotherhood were five days parading
                    the country round, attacking the Sun with sky rockets &amp;
                    merry-making all the way. four Angels on horseback were in
                    the procession. on the fifth night they returned – &amp; the
                    four Angels then alternately addressed their Lady – informed
                    her of all they had been doing to her honour &amp; glory,
                    &amp; besought her to preserve the same devout spirit in her
                    own Portugueze, which would make them &lt;still&gt;
                    invincible. this done the Angels left the church &amp; with
                    the Banner of the Virgin; &amp; all their attendants – came
                    into the Plaza – to see the fireworks. a comical thing for
                    Angels. last year they had at this festival some very
                    ingenious fireworks – Two Lions that spit fire at each other
                    – &amp; when they had done spitting fire, they made fire
                    from a part that you would rather have expected to be
                    employed in water-works – &amp; &lt;then&gt; they veered
                    round &amp; bumbarded each other with fire – &amp; all this
                    in honour of our Lady of the Incarnation! – Among my many
                    embryo plans are two attacks upon this ridiculous &amp;
                    detestable superstition. the one a burlesque Poem – some
                    Saint the Hero – in which the mock-miracles &amp; the
                    strange mistake of apathy, indolence &amp; filth for virtues
                    might furnish ample scope for satire. the other is with me a
                    favourite subject – [MS torn] Establishment of the

<p rend="indent1"> Possibly the exceeding filthiness of the

<p rend="indent1"> As a proof how little reading there is in
