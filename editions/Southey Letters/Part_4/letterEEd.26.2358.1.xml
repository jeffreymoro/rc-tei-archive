                    gently reproving him for his insincerity, rather for the purpose of showing him that he does not impose upon me, than for any
                    thing else. About his marriage or non-marriage I have said nothing. He will leave the girl as he found her. There is no fear of
                    his marrying her, – it would be a symptom of grace which I am by no means prepared to expect from him. <note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Edward Southey had claimed to have married a Miss Lack (dates unknown); see Southey to John Rickman, [2
                        November 1813], Letter 2322.

                    themselves. Peace with him, on any terms, would do more injury to morals &amp; <del>upon</del> national feelings than
                        <del>xxx</del> the whole course of the French Revolution has yet produced. Remember his lies &amp; his murders, &amp; his
                    conduct toward Holland – Portugal – Spain – indeed toward all nations. <note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Bonaparte had put
                        an end to France’s ally, the Batavian Republic, in 1806 and installed his brother, Louis (1778–1846), as King of Holland. In
                        1810 he deposed Louis and Holland was absorbed into France. Bonaparte was also responsible for ordering the French invasion of
                        Portugal in 1807 and Spain in 1808.</note> France will speak of all these things as she speaks of the September massacres, the
                    noyades &amp;c when he is destroyed: <note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The ‘September massacres’ occurred during 2–7
                        September 1792. A mob stormed the Parisian prisons and summary trials led to the execution of over 1,400 prisoners. The
                        ‘noyades’ were mass drownings of perceived counter-revolutionaries at Nantes in November 1793–February 1794. Possibly as many
                        as 4,000 people were executed in this manner.</note> – but as long as he reigns the same system of falsehood will be
                    continued, <del>x</del> all his measures will still be represented to the people as just &amp; <del>xxxxx</del> politic &amp; the
                    indignation of the people will be directed against the nations who have thrown off the yoke, — instead of against the Tyrant who
                    imposed it.</p><closer><salute rend="indent2">God bless you</salute><signed rend="indent3">RS.</signed></closer></div></body></text></TEI>
