                    not suspect me of saying more than the truth when I add that there are others

                            <title>DNB</title>), <title>The History of Dissenters, from the
                            Revolution in 1688–to the Year 1808</title> (1812); Walter Wilson

                        1813), 90–139. Southey was particularly outraged by the changes at 132 (Paul
                        and Timothy); 135 (Milton and Defoe); and 139 (final paragraph).</note> – in
                    which I suspect <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> has done
                    more mischief than usual. Merely in cutting open the leaves I perceived some
                    omissions which one would think the very Demon of stupidity had prompted. You
                    may remember the manner in which I had illustrated Mess<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>
                    Bogue &amp; Bennets mention of Paul &amp; Timothy; – he has retained the
                    quotation &amp; cut out the comment upon it. I believe the article has lost
                    about two pages in this way. – The only other instance which caught my eye will
                    show you the spirit in which he has gone to work. B &amp; B claim Milton, Defoe
                    &amp;c as Dissenters. I called them blockheads for not perceiving that it was
                    “to their <hi rend="ital">catholick</hi> &amp; <hi rend="ital">cosmopolite</hi>
                    intellect” that these men owed their immortality, not to their <hi rend="ital">sectarian</hi> opinions &amp; the exterminating pen has gone thro the words
                    catholick &amp; cosmopolite. There is also a foolish insertion stuck in to
                    introduce the last paragraph, which at once attenuates <del>the</del> it, &amp;
                        <del>xxx</del> says ‘now I <hi rend="ital">am</hi> going to say something
                    fine’ – instead of letting the feeling rise at once from the subject. It is well
                    perhaps that the convenience of this quarterly incoming makes me placable, – or
                    I should some day tell <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref>
                    that tho I have nothing to say against any <del>alteration</del> omission which
                    may be made for political or prudential motives, – yet when the question comes
                    to a mere matter of opinion in regard to the wording of a sentence, my judgement
                    is quite as likely to be right as his. – You will really render me a great
                    service by preserving my manuscript reviewals. For some of these articles may
                    most probably be reprinted whenever my Operas come to be printed in a collected
                    form after I am gone; – &amp; these rejected passages will then be thought of
                    most value.</p><p rend="indent1"> Thirdly I wish you would, as soon as you can, call on <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref>, &amp; tell him, – not
                        <del>this</del> what I have been saying, – for I have got rid of my gall in
                    thus <del>tell</del> letting you know what I feel upon the subject, – but that I
                    will review <ref target="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppas</ref> pamphlett about
                    Junius, &amp; the Memoirs for his next number.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Junius was the pseudonym used by the author – or authors
                        – of a series of letters published in the <title>Public Advertiser</title>
                        between 21 January 1769 and 21 January 1772. The letters took a high Whig
                        line. They opposed the policies of the government and the king and were
                        generally supportive of those of the ex-Prime Minister George Grenville
                        (1712–1770; <title>DNB</title>) and of the radical politician John Wilkes
                        (1725–1797; <title>DNB</title>). There was, from the outset, much debate as
                        to the identity of their author or authors. In 1813 Duppa’s <title>Memoirs
                            by a Celebrated Literary and Political Character</title> had attempted
                        to prove Richard Glover (1712–1785; <title>DNB</title>) was the author of
                        Junius’s letters. (It was a contribution to an ongoing controversy. In the
                        same year, John Taylor’s <title>A Discovery of the Author of the Letters of
                            Junius</title> proposed another, more plausible, though equally
                        controversial, candidate: the politician and writer Sir Philip Francis
                        (1740–1818; <title>DNB</title>).) Duppa defended himself against his critics
                        in an anonymous pamphlet, <title>An Inquiry Concerning the Author of the
                            Letters of Junius, with Reference to the Memoirs by a Celebrated
                            Literary and Political Character</title> (1814). Southey did not review
                        Duppa’s pamphlet for the <title>Quarterly</title>.</note> Perhaps I may
                    succeed in this, as in approaching Junius I shall take rather a wider
                        <del>moral</del> view <del>xxxx</del> of political morality than he &amp;
