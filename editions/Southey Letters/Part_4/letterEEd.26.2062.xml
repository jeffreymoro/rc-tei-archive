                        of Vernor, Hood and Sharpe had been part of the congerie that issued <title>The Remains of Henry Kirke White</title> in 1807.
                        The transfer took place and the next (sixth) edition of the <title>Remains</title> was published solely by Longman, Hurst,
                        Rees, Orme and Brown in 1813.</note> house wholly to <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman’s</ref> which is not to
                    be overcome; and that is, that the two houses being partners in this concern, the one will not choose to do anything detrimental
                    to the other. Your interest or inclination is nothing to them: they will consider nothing but themselves; and it will be more <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman’s</ref> interest to remain with a fourth share of the profits and the goodwill of
                    Vernon’s house, than to take a third, and, by so doing, offend them.</p><p rend="indent1"> I did not tell you in my last that I hope to produce a few lines, in the form of an inscription, for a tablet in
                    Wilford churchyard,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey’s inscription (which was never executed) was intended as a
                        tribute to a place commemorated by Henry Kirke White in his ‘Lines Written in Wilford Church-Yard’; see
                        <title>Remains</title>, 2 vols (London, 1807), I, pp. 38–40. (The 1807 <title>Remains</title> included a small section of
                        verses praising White, I, pp. 265–276, this had been expanded in the editions of 1810 and 1811.) Wilford was then a village
                        just outside Nottingham.</note> because in cases of this kind the deed does not always follow the will; and if I could have
                    succeeded I should have sent you the poem, if I had failed the disappointment would have been confined to myself. This is the only
                    reply which I can make to you on my own part. I can engage to produce a great poem which shall be the work of years, and is to be
                    drawn from accumulate stores — the work of long meditation and labour; but for those smaller pieces, which, if they come, must
                    come unsought, I never can bind myself. From <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> I could, without
                    difficulty, procure you a promise, but am very certain that such a promise would end in nothing. His good nature would render it
                    impossible for him to refuse, and his habits would render it still more impossible for him to perform what he had thus
                    incautiously pledged himself to do. I would not have the book assume the appearance of a formal collection of verses; there must
                    be, as in all these “Illustrations,” some short descriptive accounts of the places represented in the prints, and such poems as
                    you may obtain had better appear interspersed in their respective places.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Neville White
                        seems to have proposed a volume of prints of places celebrated in his brother’s poems; see Southey to Neville White, 12 April
                        1812, Letter 2076. This was intended to complement and capitalise on the popularity of Henry Kirke White’s
                            <title>Remains</title>. Neville White’s model was probably <title>Illustrations of Walter Scott’s Lay of the Last
                            Minstrel. Consisting of Twelve Views on the Rivers Bothwick, Ettrick, Yarrow, Tiviot, and Tweed: with Anecdotes and
                            Descriptions</title> (1810). This had been published by Longman, Hurst, Rees, and Orme, which in turn might explain
                        White’s determination to move publication of future editions of the <title>Remains</title> away from the congerie headed by
                        Vernor, Hood and Sharpe.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> I congratulate you on your good resolutions, and shall be truly glad to congratulate you when they are carried into
                    effect. A man may be cheerful and contented in celibacy, but I do not think he can ever be happy; it is an unnatural state, and
                    the best feelings of his nature are never called into action. The risks of marriage are far greater on the woman’s side; women
                    have so little the power of choice, that it is not perhaps fair to say they are less likely to choose well than we are; but I am
                    persuaded that they are more frequently deceived in the attachments which they form, and their opinions concerning men are much
                    less accurate than men’s opinion of their sex. Now if a lady were to reproach me for having said this, I should reply that it was
                    only another mode of saying there were more good wives in the world than there are good husbands, which I verily believe. I know
                    nothing which a good and sensible man is so certain to find, if he looks for it, as a good wife.</p><p rend="indent1"> I would answer <ref target="people.html#ConderJosiah">Josiah Condor’s</ref> note if I were more at leisure, and

                        via Southey). See Southey to Neville White, 27 September 1812, Letter 2151.</note> Tell him also that I have unfortunately
