                    likely to be detrimental than otherwise. That <ref target="people.html#HerriesJohnCharles">Herries</ref> will do what he can, is
                    certain, – because he volunteered his services both now &amp; on the former occasion. As for <ref target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</ref> he is not likely to come into place at all without a total change of Ministry, &amp; would then most probably
                    resume his former situation.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> i.e. Foreign Secretary (a post Canning held 1807–1809),

                            <title>De Orbe Novo</title> (1511–1530) provides important early accounts of the exploration and colonisation of
                        Central and South America. In this letter, Southey references the English translation by Richard Eden (c. 1520–1576;
                            <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Decades of the Newe Worlde or West India: Conteyning the Navigations and Conquestes of the
                            Spanyards</title> (1555); Southey owned an edition of 1612, no. 1862 in the sale catalogue of his library. (Southey also
                        owned a Latin edition of 1574, no. 1811 in the sale catalogue of his library.) Southey was encouraging his brother to write a
                        history of the West Indies, which finally appeared in 1828.</note> carefully, &amp; <del>xx</del> refer to him for all the
                    facts <del>xxx</del> in Muñoz<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Juan Bautista Muñoz (1745–1799) was commissioned to write an
                        official account of Spanish involvement in the New World. Part of his researches appeared as <title>Historia del
                            Nuevo-Mundo</title> (1793), the rest were unpublished at his death. Southey owned an English translation of 1797, no. 1263
                        in the sale catalogue of his library.</note> which there is his authority for: the oldest authorities always being those upon
                    which history must rest. Charlevoix<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Pierre Francois Xavier de Charlevoix (1682–1761),
                            <title>Histoire de l’Isle Espagnole, ou de Saint Dominque</title> (1730). Southey owned an edition of 1733, no. 574 no.

                    being a Jesuit, &amp; what is far worse a Frenchman he requires comparison also as I know by experience. Mr Viner<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Samuel Viner (c. 1740–1815), a minor canon of Durham Cathedral. He possibly had some

                    succeeding, tho it is full of rich poetry, &amp; a bad play, both of which are to a certain degree against it. Yet its dramatic
                    faults were as little likely to be generally felt as its poetical beauties, &amp; I relied upon its stage effect. Kemble &amp;
                    Sheridan rejected this play fifteen years ago<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> The actor John Philip Kemble (1757–1823;
                            <title>DNB</title>) and the playwright, theatre proprietor and politician Richard Brinsley Sheridan (1751–1816;
                            <title>DNB</title>) had rejected it in 1797, when it was titled ‘Osorio’.</note> – had it been acted then <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</ref> might have written fifteen better by this time, for there is no man upon
                    whom the applause of pit box &amp; gallery could produce more effect. Better late than never, &amp; its success is in seasonable

                    but it confirms the opinion which has been formed here. The <ref target="people.html#BarkerMary">Senhora’s</ref> remark was,
                    “Southey, you say. Scott has got the Goose – but I think the Goose will turn out a poor forsaken Gander”. <ref target="people.html#SunderlinLady">Lady Sunderlin</ref> said that if this had been the first of his poems which she had read
                    she should not have admired is as she does. Their opinions lead me to anticipate a somewhat general disappointment, – &amp; that
                    disappointment will explain the true cause of <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scotts</ref> popularity, – for Rokeby is
                    written with as much life &amp; spirit, &amp; not more carelessly than any of its predecessors, – but it is not so pretty a novel,
                    &amp; those persons can judge of this, who can judge of nothing else.</p><p rend="indent1"> The rest of Nelson<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> Tom was reading and correcting the MS of the
