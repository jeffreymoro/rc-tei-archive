                        1759–1763. Southey had expressed his interest in Elliott’s project in his letter of 5 June 1810 (Letter 1783).</note> – it
                    tired <del>xxxxxxx</del> nothing but my eyes, – nevertheless my first opinion remains <del>xx</del> unaltered, that the subject is
                    utterly unfit for poetry, &amp; that if you will not be content to regard all that you have written upon it as a heap of old
                    materials in which you may quarry for ready cut stones to employ in <del>a better</del> building upon a happier site, – you had
                    better resolutely throw the whole <del>xxx</del> behind the fire.</p><p rend="indent1"> The event is so near our own times as to render any machinery not merely improper, but even absurd. We reconcile
                    ourselves easily to the thought of a Greek or Trojan talking to the Gods, &amp; of Jupiter deciding between the two parties, &amp;
                    even willing the death of any individual among them, because the mortal agents are so far removed into the age of fable that
                        <del>xxx</del> the existence of them &amp; their Gods is alike to us, – we hear of both in the same story, &amp; always have
                    heard of them together. But Gods &amp; Grenadiers, or Genii &amp; Grenadiers are a most ill-judged assortment, &amp; to introduce
                    Deity as casting a thought upon the petty squabbles of the French &amp; English in Canada, is both monstrous in taste, &amp;
                    would, I am sure, be offensive to the common religious feelings of the country. Besides, the subject itself is altogether unworthy
                    of any supernatural agency, &amp; your Ghost is misplaced. Neither good nor evil has resulted from the conquest of Canada, – nor
                    is any good to be expected from it while <del>xx</del> French continues the language of the country. I am sure the event is
                    utterly unfit for poetry, &amp; utterly unworthy of it, – &amp; the more you strain &amp; strive to elevate it, – the more
                    gorgeous are the colours with which you embroider the canvas, the more is the coarseness &amp; poverty of the canvas itself
                    displayed.</p><p rend="indent1"> You appear to me to have an over-anxiety for raising &amp; ornamenting your subject. There are two remedies for
                    this, – chuse a topic so noble in itself as to lead you into no temptation of this nature, – or one so wild that you may weave up
                    with it as much magic &amp; machinery as your heart desires. Try which of these plans you will &amp; when M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>

                    the omen of success.
