                    gentry into compleat political insignificance. It is not parliamentary Reform which can touch this evil, – some farther limitation
                    of entails, or a proper scale of income taxation might. Concerning Parl. Reform indeed my views are much changed, – &amp; <ref target="people.html#Burdett">Sir F Burdetts</ref> scheme has not a little contributed to the alteration, elucidated as it is
                    by all his subsequent conduct. The phrase itself like Cath. Emancip.

                        Christian Curwen (1756–1828; <title>DNB</title>), for ‘“better securing the independence and purity of Parliament, by
                        preventing the procuring or obtaining seats by corrupt practices, and likewise more effectually to prevent bribery”’; see
                            <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title>, 2.1 (1811), 249–281. Curwen’s Bill did become law in the same year,
                        but was less successful than his contemporaries hoped or feared.</note> is a droll history. I compare his relationship to the
                    Bill to that between Hyreus &amp; Orion, – he furnished the skin &amp; the superior powers the contents.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> In legend, the widower Hyreus asked the gods for a son. They obliged and gave him a bull’s hide full of water,
                        which he buried in the earth for nine months. When the hide was dug up and opened, the infant Orion emerged. Southey drew on
                        the same comparison in his assessment of Curwen and his Bill in <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title>, 2.1
