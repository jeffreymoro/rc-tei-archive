                        towards Hartley Coleridge’s expenses at university.</note> – &amp; in my own for your poem,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Cottle’s biblical epic
                            <title>Messiah</title> (1815).</note> the brief account (too brief) of your excellent parent,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Cottle’s mother, Sarah, had died on
                        18 December 1813.</note> – &amp; the pencil, – to which I affix no common value. The idea which you have expressed in your cancelled preface of the couplet coincides with the
                    practice of our early poets; many, or rather most of whom, wrote it with all the freedom &amp; variety of blank verse.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> A cancelled
                        preface to Cottle’s biblical epic <title>Messiah</title>. The first part (which engaged with the Old Testament) appeared in 1815, a second part (dealing with the New Testament)
                        in 1820.</note> My judgement upon this point accords with theirs &amp; with yours. I could have wished that the title of your poem had been different: because it unavoidably
                    excites an expectation that the subject will be the New &amp; not the Old Testament history – but I see the difficulty of substituting any other which <del>xxx</del> would embrace
                    the whole of so extensive a plan. Have you ever seen Sylvesters translation of Du Bartas?<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Joshua Sylvester (1562/3–1618;
                            <title>DNB</title>), translator of <title>Bartas his Devine Weekes and Workes</title> (1608). This played a crucial role in disseminating the writings of the French
                        Huguenot epic poet Guilluame de Salluste Du Bartas (1544–1590).</note> The great work<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Du Bartas’s <title>La Sepmaine; ou, Creation du
                            Monde</title> (1578).</note> upon which the extraordinary, tho ephemeral, popularity of the French poet was founded, takes the same range of scripture history that you have
                    done, tho’ handled in a very different manner, being full of digressions &amp; desultory matter. Du Bartas comes down to the Captivity. – Two other parts were to have compleated
                    his plan – Messiah, &amp; the Eternal Sabbath, but he did not live to write them. But I am inclined to think that if he had lived, he would have filled up the intervening portion
                    of Jewish history, &amp; probably have made his Judith<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Du Bartas’s first epic <title>Judith</title> (1573), based on
                            <title>Judith</title> 13: 1–10. It was translated into English by Thomas Hudson (d. in or before 1605; <title>DNB</title>) in 1584.</note> a part of this extensive
                    undertaking. You who perhaps are not so tolerant in these matters as I am, would perhaps be disgusted with the conceits of Du Bartas &amp; the quaintnesses of his translator: I can
                    see all their faults &amp; yet admire the powers which both have perverted.</p><p rend="indent1"> I do not see why you should not enlarge your plan to three parts, &amp; carry on the history in the second thro the whole intermediate period between the Psalmist
                    &amp; the commencement of the New Testament. There are many splendid subjects, &amp; the connection of the whole would appear more clearly than if you pass at once, with so long a
                    skip to the Gospel Dispensation.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> Cottle did not follow Southey’s advice. The second part of the <title>Messiah</title>, published in
                        1820, dealt with the New Testament.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> I admire the general flow, &amp; the frequent felicity of your verses. Some of the liberties which you take with language, <del>such as omitting the article, &amp;
                        inserting the</del> &amp; some occasional inversions, I should not have used. But your ear is always good, &amp; <del>one</del> &lt;anyone&gt; who studies the rhymed-couplet
                    would do well to go to school to you.</p><p rend="indent1"> We are going on well, God be thanked. I am working away at sundry employments, continually accumulating materials for more works than I can possibly live to
                    compleat, – yet <del>it xx</del> this is <hi rend="ital">not</hi> loss of time, for it is a continual accumulation of knowledge which is always turning to account, <del>x</del> I
                    have not got thro the introduction to my Tale of Paraguay<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>A Tale of Paraguay</title> (1825).</note> yet; – but when the fit takes
                    me my progress will be rapid. At present my main business is the history of Brazil,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> The first volume of <title>The History of
                            Brazil</title> had appeared in 1810; volumes 2 and 3 followed in 1817 and 1819, respectively.</note> a most laborious work which will be most inadequately remunerated. I
                    speak within compass when I say that the same time &amp; labour bestowed upon temporary subjects might have produced ten times more emolument: nevertheless I have chosen well,
                    &amp; shall persevere thro the whole series of my historical <del>labours</del> undertaking.</p><p rend="indent1"> I recognized your hand on a Bristol newspaper last night.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> Unidentified.</note> We knew that <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> was with the Morgans<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"><ref target="people.html#MorganJohnJames">John</ref>

                    principles as far as the understanding is concerned, &amp; an intellect as clear &amp; as powerful as ever was vouchsafed to man, he is the slave of the vilest &amp; most degrading
                    sensuality, &amp; sacrifices every thing to it. The case is equally deplorable &amp; monstrous.</p><p rend="indent1"> Is it in vain to say how truly we should rejoice if you &amp; <ref target="people.html#Cottlefamily">your sister</ref> would pass your summer holy
