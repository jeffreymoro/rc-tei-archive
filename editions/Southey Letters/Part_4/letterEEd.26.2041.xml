                    ‘precisely as I recommend’ &amp; requesting me particularly to point out any other passages which should be cancelled.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> At the request of Murray, Southey had read a MS of Landor’s <title>Commentary on Memoirs of Mr
                            Fox</title>, which was ostensibly a response to John Bernard Trotter’s (1775–1818; <title>DNB</title>) laudatory account
                        of his erstwhile employer Charles James Fox. See Southey to Walter Savage Landor, 10 February
                        1812 (Letter 2034) and 11 February 1812 (Letter 2035), and Robert Southey to John Murray 15 February 1812 (Letter 2039).
                        Although the <title>Commentary</title> was printed, Murray eventually suppressed its publication, refusing to issue a book
                        that attacked the Tory government and was dedicated to James Madison (1751–1836), President of the United States 1809–1817,
                        with whom Britain was about to go to war.</note> This I am exceedingly glad of, &amp; shall lose no time in giving the book a
                    second serious perusal, &amp; censuring it while censure can be of service.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey
                        offered Landor further advice; see Robert Southey to Walter Savage Landor, 21 February 1812, Letter 2043.</note> Every thing
                    which is legally or morally objectionable will now be got rid of, – there are some things which <del>nei</del> are neither the one
                    nor the other, &amp; yet which I could wish were not there, – the manner for instance for <ref target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</ref> is spoken of,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Charles James Fox: a Commentary on his Life and Character
                        by Walter Savage Landor</title>, ed. Stephen Wheeler (1907), p. 216. ‘He was a very extraordinary boy, and is a very extraordinary boy
                        still. He has not grown an inch in intellect … [he is] answerable to the country for the loss of five thousand men, and for
                        the worst of all our badly planned attacks [the Walcheren expedition of 1809]. Canning is among those sour productions, which
                        acquire an early tinge of maturity, and drop off. It is idleness or unwariness in those who pick them up and taste them, and
                        folly or shame in those who do not spit them out.’</note> – but of this I can only say that I wish it had not been written,
                    not that I think it <hi rend="ital">ought</hi> to be cancelled, – because public men like poets are liable to be spoken of well or
                    ill according to the opinion of those who chuse to pass sentence upon them. The mention of <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</ref> is decidedly wrong in matter of fact &amp; of principle,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Landor removed
                        any mention of Croker from his book.</note> – but in mere matters of opinion it would be foolish &amp; presumptuous to require
                    the writer to suppress his in deference to mine.</p><p rend="indent1"> I am afraid I never replied to your question respecting the reviewal of Edgeworths book.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The article by John Davison (1777–1834; <title>DNB</title>) on Richard Lovell Edgeworth (1744–1817;

                        (August 1811), 166–191. <title>Professional Education</title> was largely the work of Maria Edgeworth (1768–1849;
                            <title>DNB</title>), though only her father was credited on the title page.</note> It pleased me very much, – censure was
                    never delivered in a better spirit, &amp; the criticism was as much distinguished by its good sense as its good temper.</p><p rend="indent1"> There is a book of Waltons about the Peruvian sheep (not his Spanish Colonies which I have)<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Walton (1783/4–1857; <title>DNB</title>). He had been junior secretary to the British expedition which
                        captured Santo Domingo from the French in 1802, and had remained there as British agent. He returned to England in 1809 and
                        developed a career as a political journalist, arguing against ministerial policies towards Spain and Portugal. His writings
                        included <title>Present State of the Spanish Colonies; Including a Particular Report of Hispanola, or the Spanish Part of
                            Santo Domingo</title> (1810), no. 2978 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. A keen agriculturalist, Walton was also
                        an advocate for the importation of ‘Peruvian sheep’ (vicuna) and alpacas into Britain, see his <title>An Historical and
                            Descriptive Account of the Four Species of Peruvian Sheep, called Carneros de la Tierra: To which are Added, Particulars

                    Spanish volume <del>xxxxxx</del> which has so long been in my possession, &amp; which if it can be purchased I should be very glad

                        a duplicate is nowhere to be found, was given me by Mr Murray; it contains the fullest account which has yet been published on
                        the old Vice-royalty of Peru, province by province. The information was obtained from the respective Corregidores, and printed
                        for many successive years in the Lima Almanack, from whence some curioso cut out the whole collection, and formed them into
