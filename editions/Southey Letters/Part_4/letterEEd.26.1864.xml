                    stationed along <del>the</del> side the monkey, where he might have corrected his notions in fit company, &amp; where he would
                    have learnt with Major Plunkett that a sea fight is a mighty serious sort of a thing.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                        first anecdote Southey refers to concerns a monkey on board the <hi rend="ital">Royal Sovereign</hi> during the Battle of the
                        Glorious First of June (1794). The monkey was chained in the launch on the main deck throughout the battle. Major Plunkett
                        might be Major James Plunkett of Kinnaid (fl. 1800s), husband of the novelist Elizabeth Gunning (1769–1823;
                        <title>DNB</title>).</note> – Lose no time in replying to this.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey used this
                        material in <title>Omniana; or, Horae Otiosiores</title>, 2 vols (London, 1812), II, pp. 237–40.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> I have this day finished an important part of the Register, an enquiry into the nation &amp; possibility of Reform,
                    in reference to <ref target="people.html#Burdett">Sir F. Burdetts</ref> plan,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> For
                        Southey’s account of, and opposition to Burdett’s plan, <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title>, 2.1 (1811),
                        282–294. Burdett had proposed a ratepayer franchise, equal electoral districts, shorter parliaments and general elections held
                        on one day in all seats.</note> – which is shallow beyond conception. The result is a conviction in my own mind that the
                    influence of Government cannot be diminished without the virtual destruction of Government: that the real evil in our
                    representation is the influence of the great Land Leviathans, who can go to a minister &amp; demand a seat in the Cabinet for
                    themselves &amp; in reply to all his remonstrances upon the unfitness of the thing, make no other answer than “We are seven” like
                        <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth’s</ref> little girl.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Lyrical Ballads</title> (1798), pp. 110–114.</note> that this influence dies a natural death in the thriving counties,
                    when the increase of wealth splits property into small freeholds, – &amp; that it might be destroyed by farther limitations of
                    entails, or an income tax justly graduated. But that the two main evils of our system of Government consist in governing by a
                    Cabinet, instead of a Prime Minister, – &amp; in the existence of a regular party in the legislature whose business is to impede
                    as far they can all measures of the Government &amp; to villify the Administration (be it what it may) so as to bring it into
                    contempt &amp; hatred with the people: to argue always against their own country, &amp; against <del>their</del> &lt;its&gt;
                    allies, &amp; to act in <del>xxx</del> &lt;plain English&gt; as allies of the enemy. For this evil I see no remedy unless it is
                    possible to expose the scandal &amp; the absurdity &amp; the mischief so strongly as to excite a sense of shame in party men
                    themselves. There is no reason why we should not have a responsible Premier instead of a Cabinet, – both being equally unknown to
                    the Constitution, which requires only that the Kings advisors be responsible. The vice &amp; original sin of a Cabinet is that all
                    measures are garbled there &amp; every thing carried on by concessions &amp; compromises. Canning for instance would send
                        <del>xx</del> 50,000 men to Spain, – no says somebody else – I would not send any men at all there. – so they agree to send
                    25,000 – &amp; in this way every thing is ruined. – The burthen of my song is this, that – ‘in these times the paramount duty of a
                    true patriot is to exert himself in raising the spirit of his countrymen to the pitch of those days when they won crowns, &amp;
                    brought home captive Kings. The one business of England is to abate the power of France; that power she must beat down, or fall
                    herself; that power she will beat down, if she do but wisely &amp; strenuously put forth her own mighty means.’<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title>, 2.1 (1811), 293.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> See what a rascally part the Whigs &amp; the <ref target="people.html#Burdett">Burdettites</ref> have taken upon
