Hear me too,</l><l rend="indent3"> Auria, &amp; Spain &amp; Heaven! he cried; &amp; thou</l><l rend="indent3"> Who risest thus above mortality,</l><l rend="indent3"> Sufferer &amp; Patriot, Saint &amp; Heroine,</l><l rend="indent3"> The Servant &amp; the Chosen of the Lord,</l><l rend="indent3"> For surely such thou art, – receive in me</l><l rend="indent3"> The first fruits of thy calling! – Kneeling then</l><l rend="indent3"> And placing as he spake his hands in hers,</l><l rend="indent3"> As thou hast sworn, the Royal Goth pursued,</l><l rend="indent3"> Even so I swear.

Herein I place</l><l rend="indent3"> My penance for the past, my hope to come,</l><l rend="indent3"> My faith &amp; my good works, here offer up</l><l rend="indent3"> All thoughts &amp; passions of mine inmost heart,</l><l rend="indent3"> My days &amp; nights, this flesh, this blood, this life</l><l rend="indent3"> Yea this whole being, – I revoke it thus</l><l rend="indent3"> For Spain! Receive the vow all Saints in Heaven</l><l rend="indent3"> And prosper its good end.</l><l rend="indent7"> Clap now your wings,</l><l rend="indent3"> The Goth with louder utterance as he rose</l><l rend="indent3"> Exclaimd, – clap now your wings exultingly</l><l rend="indent3"> Ye ravenous fowl of Heaven; &amp; in your dens</l><l rend="indent3"> Set up ye Wolves of Spain a yell of joy!</l><l rend="indent3"> For lo! a Nation hath this day been sworn</l><l rend="indent3"> To furnish forth your banquet; for a strife</l><l rend="indent3"> Commenceth which must know no end or rest</l><l rend="indent3"> Till in this land the last invader bow</l><l rend="indent3"> Beneath the exterminating sword!</l><l rend="indent8"> With that,</l><l rend="indent3"> Said I not rightly, Adosinda cried,</l><l rend="indent3"> The will which goads me on is not mine own,</l><l rend="indent3"> Tis from on high, – yea verily, of Heaven!</l><l rend="indent3"> But who art thou who hast professd with me</l><l rend="indent3"> My first sworn brother in the appointed rule?</l><l rend="indent3"> Tell me thy name!</l><l rend="indent6"> Ask any thing but that!</l><l rend="indent3"> The fallen King replied. My name was lost</l><l rend="indent3"> When from the Goths the sceptre past away.</l><l rend="indent3"> The nation will arise regenerate,</l><l rend="indent3"> Strong in her second youth, &amp; beautiful,</l><l rend="indent3"> And like a Spirit which hath shaken off</l><l rend="indent3"> The clay of dull mortality, shall Spain</l><l rend="indent3"> Arise in glory; but for my good name</l><l rend="indent3"> No resurrection is appointed here, –</l><l rend="indent3"> Let it be blotted out on Earth, – in Heaven</l><l rend="indent3"> There will be written with it penitence,</l><l rend="indent3"> And grace &amp; saving faith, &amp; such good deeds</l><l rend="indent3"> Wrought in atonement as my soul, this day</l><l rend="indent3"> Hath sworn to offer up.</l><l rend="indent6"> Then be thy name,</l><l rend="indent3"> She answered, Maccabee from this day forth,</l><l rend="indent3"> For this day art thou born again, &amp; like</l><l rend="indent3"> Those brethren of old times, whose holy names</l><l rend="indent3"> Live in the memory of all noble hearts</l><l rend="indent3"> For love &amp; admiration, ever young, –</l><l rend="indent3"> So for our native country, for our hearths</l><l rend="indent3"> And altars, for her cradles &amp; her graves,</l><l rend="indent3"> Hast thou thyself devoted.

Gazing he stood</l><l rend="indent3"> As at a heavenly visitation there</l><l rend="indent3"> Vouchsafed, in mercy to himself &amp; Spain;</l><l rend="indent3"> And when the heroic mourner from his sight</l><l rend="indent3"> Had past away, still reverential awe</l><l rend="indent3"> Held him suspended there &amp; motionless.</l><l rend="indent3"> Then turning from the ghastly scene of death,</l><l rend="indent3"> Up murmuring Lona he began toward</l><l rend="indent3"> The holy Bierzo his obedient way.</l><l rend="indent3"> Sils ample stream he crost, where thro the vale</l><l rend="indent3"> Of Orras from that sacred land he bears</l><l rend="indent3"> The whole collected waters; northward then</l><l rend="indent3"> Skirting the heights of Aguiar, he reached</l><l rend="indent3"> That consecrated pile amid the wild,</l><l rend="indent3"> Which sainted Fructuoso in his zeal</l><l rend="indent3"> Reard to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Felix on Visonias banks.</l></lg><lb/><lg type="stanza"><l rend="indent3"> In commune with a Priest <del>whose</del> &lt;of&gt; age

From Auria? said the old man,</l><l rend="indent3"> Comst thou from Auria brother? I can spare</l><l rend="indent3"> Thy painful errand then; – we know the worst.</l></lg><lb/><lg type="stanza"><l rend="indent3"> Nay, answerd Roderick, but thou hast not heard</l><l rend="indent3"> My tale. Where that devoted City lies</l><l rend="indent3"> In ashes, mid the ruins of the dead</l><l rend="indent3"> I found a woman whom the Moors had borne</l><l rend="indent3"> Captive away: but she, by Heaven inspird</l><l rend="indent3"> And her good heart, with her own hand wrought</l><l rend="indent3"> Her own deliverance, smiting in his tent</l><l rend="indent3"> A lustful Moorish miscreant, as of yore</l><l rend="indent3"> By Judiths holy deed the Assyrian fell;</l><l rend="indent3"> And that same spirit which had strengthend her</l><l rend="indent3"> Workd in her still. Four walls with patient toil</l><l rend="indent3"> She reard, wherein as in a sepulchre</l><l rend="indent3"> With her own hands she laid her murderd babe,</l><l rend="indent3"> Her husband &amp; her parents, <del>sid</del> side by
                        side;</l><l rend="indent3"> And when we covered in this shapeless tomb,</l><l rend="indent3"> There on the grave of all her family,</l><l rend="indent3"> Did this courageous mourner dedicate</l><l rend="indent3"> All thoughts &amp; actions of her future life</l><l rend="indent3"> To her poor country; for she said, that Heaven</l><l rend="indent3"> Supporting her, in mercy had vouchsafd</l><l rend="indent3"> A foretaste of revenge, – that like the grace</l><l rend="indent3"> Of God revenge had savd her; that in it</l><l rend="indent3"> Spain must have her salvation, &amp; henceforth</l><l rend="indent3"> That passion thus sublim’d &amp; sanctified</l><l rend="indent3"> Must be to all the loyal sons of Spain</l><l rend="indent3"> The pole star of their faith, their rule &amp; rite</l><l rend="indent3"> Observances &amp; holiest sacrifice</l><l rend="indent3"> I took the vow, unworthy as I am,</l><l rend="indent3"> Her first sworn follower in the appointed rule,</l><l rend="indent3"> And then we parted: She among the hills</l><l rend="indent3"> To rouse the vassals of her fathers house,</l><l rend="indent3"> I at her bidding hitherward, to ask</l><l rend="indent3"> Thy counsel, who of our old baronage</l><l rend="indent3"> Shall place upon his brow the Spanish crown.</l></lg><lb/><lg type="stanza"><l rend="indent3"> The Lady Adosinda? – Odoar cried.</l><l rend="indent3"> Roderick made answer, so she calld herself.</l></lg><lb/><lg type="stanza"><l rend="indent3"> O none but she! exclaimd the good old man,</l><l rend="indent3"> Clasping his hands, which trembled as he spake</l><l rend="indent3"> In act of pious passion raisd to heaven,</l><l rend="indent3"> O none but Adosinda! none but she –</l><l rend="indent3"> None but that noble heart, which was the heart</l><l rend="indent3"> Of Auria while it stood, its life &amp; strength,</l><l rend="indent3"> More than her fathers presence, or the arm</l><l rend="indent3"> Of her brave Lord, all-valiant as he was.</l><l rend="indent3"> Hers was the spirit which inspird old age,</l><l rend="indent3"> Ambitious boy-hood, girls in timid youth,</l><l rend="indent3"> And virgins in the beauty of their spring,</l><l rend="indent3"> And youthful mothers, doting like herself</l><l rend="indent3"> With ever anxious love, – she breathd thro all</l><l rend="indent3"> That zeal &amp; that devoted faithfulness</l><l rend="indent3"> Which to the invaders threats &amp; promises</l><l rend="indent3"> Turn’d a deaf ear alike, which in the head</l><l rend="indent3"> And flood of prosperous fortune checkd his course</l><l rend="indent3"> Repelld him from the walls, &amp; when at length</l><l rend="indent3"> His overpowering numbers forced their way,</l><l rend="indent3"> Even in that uttermost extremity</l><l rend="indent3"> Unyielding, still from street to street, from house</l><l rend="indent3"> To house, from floor to floor, maintaind the fight</l><l rend="indent3"> Till by their altars falling, in their doors,</l><l rend="indent3"> And on their household hearths, &amp; by their beds</l><l rend="indent3"> And cradles &amp; their fathers sepulchres,</l><l rend="indent3"> This noble army, gloriously revenged,</l><l rend="indent3"> Embraced their martyrdom. Heroic souls</l><l rend="indent3"> Well have ye done, &amp; righteously discharged</l><l rend="indent3"> Your arduous part! your service is performd</l><l rend="indent3"> Your earthly warfare done! ye have put on</l><l rend="indent3"> The purple robe of everlasting peace,</l><l rend="indent3"> Ye have received your crown, ye bear the palm</l><l rend="indent3"> Before the throne of grace!</l><l rend="indent7"> With that he paused</l><l rend="indent3"> Checking the strong emotions of his soul.</l><l rend="indent3"> Then with a calmer tone addressing him</l><l rend="indent3"> Who shard his secret thoughts, thou knowest</l><l rend="indent3"> O Urban, that they have not fallen in vain</l><l rend="indent3"> For by their virtuous sacrifice, they thinnd</l><l rend="indent3"> Alcamans thousands, &amp; his broken force</l><l rend="indent3"> Exhausted by their dear-bought victory</l><l rend="indent3"> Turn’d back from Auria, leaving us to breathe</l><l rend="indent3"> Among our mountains yet. We want not here</l><l rend="indent3"> Good hearts, nor valiant hands.

But tell me now</l><l rend="indent3"> Whom shall we rouse, &amp; place upon his head</l><l rend="indent3"> The crown of Spain? Where are the Gothic Chiefs</l><l rend="indent3"> Sacaru, Theudemir, Athanagild,</l><l rend="indent3"> All who survivd that days obstinate fight,</l><l rend="indent3"> When cloggd with bodies Chrysus scarce could force</l><l rend="indent3"> Its bloody stream along. Witizas sons,</l><l rend="indent3"> Bad offspring of a stock accurst, I know,</l><l rend="indent3"> Have put the turban on their recreant heads.</l><l rend="indent3"> Where are your own Cantabrian Lords? I ween</l><l rend="indent3"> Eudon &amp; Pedro &amp; Pelayo now</l><l rend="indent3"> Have ceasd their rivalries. If Pelayo live</l><l rend="indent3"> His were a noble heart &amp; worthy head</l><l rend="indent3"> To wield the sceptre &amp; the sword of Spain.</l></lg><lb/><lg type="stanza"><l rend="indent3"> Odoar &amp; Urban eyed him while he spake,</l><l rend="indent3"> As if they wondered whose the tongue might be,</l><l rend="indent3"> Familiar thus with chiefs &amp; thoughts of state.</l><l rend="indent3"> They scannd his countenance, but not one trace</l><l rend="indent3"> Betrayd the royal Goth, sunk was that eye</l><l rend="indent3"> Of sovereignty, &amp; on the emaciate cheek</l><l rend="indent3"> Had penitence &amp; anguish deeply drawn</l><l rend="indent3"> Their furrows premature, forestalling time,</l><l rend="indent3"> And shedding upon thirtys brow more snows</l><l rend="indent3"> Than three score winters in their natural course</l><l rend="indent3"> Might else have sprinkled there. It seems indeed</l><l rend="indent3"> That thou hast past thy days in solitude,</l><l rend="indent3"> Replied the Abbot, or thou wouldst not ask</l><l rend="indent3"> Of things so long gone by. Athanagild</l><l rend="indent3"> And Theudemir have taken on their necks</l><l rend="indent3"> The yoke. Sacaru playd a nobler part.</l><l rend="indent3"> Long within Merida did he withstand</l><l rend="indent3"> The invaders hot assault, &amp; when at length</l><l rend="indent3"> Hopeless of all relief, he yielded up</l><l rend="indent3"> The gate, disdaining in his fathers land</l><l rend="indent3"> To breathe the air of bondage, with a few</l><l rend="indent3"> Found faithful to the last, indignantly</l><l rend="indent3"> Toward the ocean did he bend his way,</l><l rend="indent3"> And shaking from his feet the dust of Spain,</l><l rend="indent3"> Took ship &amp; hoisted sail thro seas unknown</l><l rend="indent3"> To seek for freedom. Our Cantabrian Chiefs</l><l rend="indent3"> All have submitted, but the wary Moor</l><l rend="indent3"> Trusteth not all alike. At his own Court</l><l rend="indent3"> He holds Pelayo, as suspecting most</l><l rend="indent3"> That calm &amp; manly spirit. Pedros son</l><l rend="indent3"> There too he holds as hostage, &amp; secures</l><l rend="indent3"> His fathers faith. Count Eudon is despisd</l><l rend="indent3"> And so lives unmolested: when he pays</l><l rend="indent3"> His heavy tribute, then perhaps a thought</l><l rend="indent3"> Of sorrow may disturb him; or more like</l><l rend="indent3"> He meditates how profitable ’twere</l><l rend="indent3"> To be a Moor, &amp; if apostacy</l><l rend="indent3"> Were all, &amp; to be unbaptized might serve –</l><l rend="indent3"> But I waste breath upon a wretch like this,</l><l rend="indent3"> Pelayo is the only hope of Spain,</l><l rend="indent3"> Only Pelayo.</l><l rend="indent5"> If as we believe</l><l rend="indent3"> Said Urban then, the hand of Heaven is here,</l><l rend="indent3"> And dreadful tho they be, yet for wise end </l><l rend="indent3"> Of good, these visitations do its work,</l><l rend="indent3"> All dimly as our mortal sight may scan</l><l rend="indent3"> The future, yet methinks my soul descries</l><l rend="indent3"> How in Pelayo should the purposes</l><l rend="indent3"> Of Heaven be best accomplishd. All too long</l><l rend="indent3"> Here in their own inheritance the sons</l><l rend="indent3"> Of Spain have ground beneath a foreign yoke,</l><l rend="indent3"> Punic &amp; Roman, Kelt &amp; Greek &amp; Goth;</l><l rend="indent3"> This later tempest comes to sweep away</l><l rend="indent3"> All proud distinctions which commingling blood</l><l rend="indent3"> And times long course had faild to efface; &amp; now</l><l rend="indent3"> Perchance it is the will of fate to rear</l><l rend="indent3"> Upon the soil of Spain a Spanish throne,</l><l rend="indent3"> Restoring in Pelayos mountain line</l><l rend="indent3"> The sceptre to the Spaniard.</l><l rend="indent7"> Go thou then</l><l rend="indent3"> And seek Pelayo at the Conquerors court.</l><l rend="indent3"> Tell him the mountaineers are unsubdued,</l><l rend="indent3"> The precious time they needed hath been gaind</l><l rend="indent3"> By Aurias sacrifice, &amp; all they ask</l><l rend="indent3"> Is him to guide them on.

Come hither thou</l><l rend="indent3"> Who for thyself hast chosen the good part.</l><l rend="indent3"> Let me lay hands on thee &amp; consecrate</l><l rend="indent3"> Thy life unto the Lord.</l><l rend="indent6"> Me!
