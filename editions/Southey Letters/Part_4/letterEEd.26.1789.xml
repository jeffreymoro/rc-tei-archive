               subsided; it is resolved that she is carefully to preserve it for her children’s children, to be an heir-loom and family doll for
               evermore; and the conceit of the value which all the caps and coifs will acquire when they come to be fashions of the generations that
               are gone, has contributed to reconcile me to the profusion with which their wardrobe has been fitted up. The screens are to ornament my
               library, – being the drawing or full-dress room of the house. I hope they will give <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay"

               will always be to be found. A collection of accurate drawings is far more valuable than the plants themselves, however well preserved

               various appearances from the time that the seed pushed out its first leaflets, to its full-grown beauty, and its final decay, – the bud
               in all its stages till the foliage is fully developed, and the flowers and fructification in like manner. This would in itself be a
               delightful work, and it could not be executed without leading to a considerable experimental knowledge in natural history, which, when
