                    repeatedly wished for you to enjoy it with us. Some of our purposed excursions are postponed till your arrival. The sooner you
                    come the better: every day now shortens upon us, and though I hope we shall manage so as never to want daylight, this is a country
                    in which we cannot have too much of it.</p><p rend="indent1"><ref target="people.html#WhiteJames">James</ref> wrote to me, some week or ten days since, a very pleasing and good letter in
                    every respect. He expresses a solicitude about taking his degree with some credit, on account of the pleasure which it would give
                    you. This feeling does him great honour, but I fear he is rather too <hi rend="ital">anxious</hi> about it; and it might perhaps
                    have a good effect if you were to assure him that you see this point in its true light, and attach no undue importance to a thing
                    which can in no degree affect his future fortunes. You have not sent him to college to seek his fortune by academical pursuits,
                    but that he may be qualified for the ministry there, and obtain that degree and those testimonials which are very properly
                    considered as necessary for one who enters into the service of the Established Church. I have said this because it is evident to
                    me that the fear of not taking an <hi rend="ital">honorary</hi> degree haunts him; and this is a bad thing for anybody, especially
                    for one whose health and spirits cannot afford much wear and tear.</p><p rend="indent1"> Thank you for the B. Ayres papers.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey was probably reading the
                            <title>Gazeta de Buenos Ayres</title>, a weekly newspaper than ran 7 June 1810 - 12 September 1821. The ‘Assembly of the
                        Year XIII’, called together in October 1812, was responsible for the legislation that so astonished Southey.</note> Imperfect
                    as the series is, it is very valuable, and has given me much more knowledge of what is going on in that unhappy country than I
                    could have obtained from any other source. Will you believe that the Revolutionary Government there has made one law fixing the
                    time before which children shall not be weaned, and another forbidding that they shall be whipped at school!! The wicked conduct
                    of that beast Ferdinand<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Ferdinand VII (1784–1833; King of Spain 1808, 1813–1833). He had
                        abolished the liberal Constitution of 1812 on 4 May 1814 and arrested the leading liberals.</note> will doubtless render the
                    separation of the colonies inevitable. Alas, that the despotism of the old country, and the republicanism (how is that name
                    polluted!) of the new, should be equally blind, equally bloody, and almost equally detestable!</p><p rend="indent1"> My poem<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> still lingers in the press; – as there are, however, but two
                    sheets remaining, I expect that they will both have reached me before you receive this letter. Have you seen Wordsworth’s
                        poem?<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Excursion</title> (1814).</note> If not, read it, if you can, before you see the author. You will see him with the
                    more pleasure, and look with more interest at the scenery which he describes.</p><p rend="indent1"> Did I tell you that <ref target="people.html#MontgomeryJames">Montgomery</ref> sent Mr. Gilbert<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Congregational minister Joseph Gilbert (1779–1852; <title>DNB</title>). In 1814 he was
                        classical tutor at Rotherham College and pastor of the Nether Chapel, Sheffield. A friend of Montgomery’s, Gilbert had married
                        the poet Ann Taylor (1782–1866; <title>DNB</title>) on 24 December 1813.</note> here? I was very much pleased with him, and
                    should have been very glad if he could have made a longer stay.</p><p rend="indent1"> As I do not believe with Doctor Reece and Co., that <ref target="people.html#SouthcottJoanna">Joanna
                        Southcott</ref> is actually pregnant, I of course believe that she is mad; it is more likely that she has some disease of
                    which the appearance resembles pregnancy, than that the whole should be blasphemous imposture, with the intention of producing a
                    supposititious child.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southcott had announced that she was pregnant with Shiloh
                            (<title>Genesis</title> 49: 10); see <title>The Third Book of Wonders, Announcing the Coming of Shiloh</title> (1814) and
                            <title>Prophecies Announcing the Birth of the Prince of Peace</title> (1814). Her supposed condition excited tremendous
                        public excitement and ridicule. She was examined by a number of doctors, whose findings were widely reported; these included
                        Richard Reece (1775–1831; <title>DNB</title>). Shiloh failed to appear and Southcott died on 27 December 1814. Reece was
                        one of the physicians who conducted her autopsy.</note> Had she been sent to Bedlam ten years ago, how many hundred persons
                    would have been preserved from this infectious and disgraceful insanity! God help the men who flatter the age upon its increased
                    knowledge and wisdom! This woman has her thousands and her ten thousands of believers in England. The Jesuits are just restored,
                    and have sent a colony to Ireland.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Pius VII (1742–1823), pontiff since 1800, restored the
                        Society of Jesus (which had been suppressed in 1773), in a Bull of 7 August 1814. In the same year the Jesuit, Peter James
                        Kenney (1779–1841; <title>DNB</title>), founded Clongowes Wood College, County Kildare, and it accepted its first pupil on 18
                        May 1814. It became the leading boarding school for Irish middle class Catholics.</note> The Inquisition is
                        re-established,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> In 1814 the Spanish Inquisition had been re-established by Ferdinand
                        VII. It was permanently abolished in 1834.</note> and France is placed under the protection of the Virgin Mary!<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> France had been consecrated to the Virgin Mary as its special patroness by royal decrees in 1638,
                        1656 and 1738. On 5 August 1814 Louis XVIII (1755–1824; King of France 1814–1824) ordered the initial declaration of 1638
                        should be read again in all churches on the Feast of the Assumption of the Virgin (15 August), followed by a special
                        procession of local dignitaries.</note> God bless you.</p><closer><salute rend="indent3"> Yours very affectionately,</salute><signed rend="indent4"> Robert Southey.</signed></closer></div></body></text></TEI>
