                    intelligence was certainly a disappointment, tho I felt it somewhat less than <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Dapple</ref> who does not know by experience how little the real happiness which fathers derive from their children is
                    affected by such things.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Wynn’s letter had announced the birth of a daughter, but as her name is not recorded, presumably she died young. Wynn had three living daughters, but his only son, Watkin, had died young in 1811.</note> I saw also your letter about the Laurel,
                    &amp; you will not be sorry to hear how compleatly I had acted in conformity with your <del>xxx</del> opinion. </p><p rend="indent1"> Pyes<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Henry James Pye (1745–1813; <title>DNB</title>), Southey’s predecessor
                        as Poet Laureate. He died on 11 August 1813.</note> death was announced a day or two before my departure from <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>, &amp; at the time I thought it so probable that the not-very-desirable succession
                    might be offered me, as to bestow a little serious thought upon the subject, as well as a jest or two. On my arrival in town <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> came to <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">my
                        brothers</ref> to meet me at breakfast, – told me that <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</ref> had spoken with him about
                    it &amp; he with <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref>; – that they supposed the <hi rend="ital">onus</hi> of the
                    office would be dropt, or if it were not that I might so execute it as to give it a new character, &amp; that as <hi rend="ital">detur digniori</hi><note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> ‘Let it be given to the more worthy’.</note> was the maxim upon
                    which the thing was likely to be bestowed, they thought it would become me to accept it: – my business however, <del>at xx</del>
                    whatever might be my determination, was to call without delay at the Admiralty, thank <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">C.</ref>
                    for what was certainly intended well, &amp; learn how the matter stood.</p><p rend="indent1"> Accordingly I called on <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</ref>. He had spoken to the <ref target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince</ref> &amp; the Prince observing that I had written “some good things in favour
                    of the Spaniards” said the office should be given me. You will admire the reason; – &amp; infer from it that I ought to have been
                    made historiographer because I had written Madoc.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Madoc</title> (1805). Southey had unsuccessfully canvassed for the post of Historiographer Royal in 1812.</note>
                    Presently <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</ref> meets <ref target="people.html#LiverpoolLord">Ld Liverpool</ref> &amp;
                    tells him what has past: <ref target="people.html#LiverpoolLord">Ld L.</ref> expressed his sorrow that he had not known it a day
                    sooner, for he &amp; the <ref target="people.html#HertfordLord">Marquess of Hertford</ref> had consulted together upon whom the
                    vacant honour could most properly be bestowed. – <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> was the greatest poet of the
                    day, &amp; to <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> therefore they had written to offer it. The <ref target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince</ref> was displeased at this; he, he said, ought to have been consulted, it was
                    his pleasure that I should have it &amp; have it I should. Upon this <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</ref> represented
                    that he was <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scotts</ref> friend as well as mine, that <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> &amp; I were upon friendly terms; &amp; for the sake of all three he requested that the business might rest where
                    it was.</p><p rend="indent1"> Thus it stood when I made my first call at the Admiralty. I more than half suspected that <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> would decline the offer, &amp; my own mind was made up before this suspicion was
                    verified. The manner in which <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> declined it was the handsomest possible: nothing
                    could be more friendly to me, or more honourable to himself.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Scott’s letter of 1
                        September [1813], telling Southey that he had declined the Poet Laureateship and instead recommended him to Croker. He also
                        cautioned ‘I am uncertain if you will like it, for the laurel has certainly been tarnished by some of its wearers, and as at
                        present managed, its duties are inconvenient and somewhat liable to ridicule’, H. C. Grierson (ed.), <title>The Letters of
                            Walter Scott, 1787–1832</title>, 12, vols (London, 1932–1937), III, pp. 335–336.</note> I then wrote to <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</ref> saying that as for writing odes, like exercises, the time was past when I could do
                    such things either with readiness or propriety; that unless I could do credit to the office, the office could do none to me; but
                    that if it were understood this idle form was to be dropt &amp; I were left on great public events to <del>attempt to</del>
                    commemorate them in verse, or not, as the spirit moved, in that case I should willingly accept the situation as a mark of
                    honourable distinction, which it would then become.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Southey to John Wilson Croker, [4
                        September 1813], Letter 2298.</note> How to effect this I left to him, as of course it was not for me to dictate terms to the
                        <ref target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince</ref>. This was a fortnight ago. He wrote to the <ref target="people.html#HertfordLord">Marquess of H.</ref> signifying the Prince’s pleasure that I should be appointed if the
                    Marquess was so pleased &amp; I suppose the signature is all that is now wanted. – It will be suggested to the <ref target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince</ref> that a good opportunity is offered for dropping a silly custom, because

                    dispense with it entirely will be for his credit as well as for mine.</p><p rend="indent1"> Be this as it may, the light in which I now look at this business makes me very sincerely thankful for such a
