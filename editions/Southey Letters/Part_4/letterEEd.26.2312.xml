                        Baptist Van Helmont (bap. 1579, d. 1644), a pioneer of pneumatic chemistry, he combined interests in new learning and
                        experimentation with a love of Paracelus and alchemy. ‘Butler’ was the title of the thirteenth chapter of his ‘Tractatus De
                        Morbis’, a fact that would interest Bedford because he and Southey had invented a comical epic hero called ‘the Butler’.
                        Southey owned a 1664 edition of Van Helmont’s <title>Workes</title>, no. 2896 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note>
