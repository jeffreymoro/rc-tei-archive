                    there are some persons to whom I should wish to be able to show such a voucher for the sincerity of my intentions &amp;
                    promises.</p><p rend="indent1"> Concerning Junius there is no reason why I should have been shackled by my intimacy with <ref target="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppa</ref>, – <del>xxx</del> till I have seen his reasonings I <del>xxx</del> cannot of
                    course tell whether I should agree with him or not; &amp; xx as to personal feelings I should certainly rather think my friend was
                    mistaken in a conjecture, than believe that the author of Leonidas was a <del>xxxx xx</del> villain, – for such I hold Junius to
                    have been.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> Junius was the pseudonym used by the author – or authors – of a series of
                        letters published in the <title>Public Advertiser</title> between 21 January 1769 and 21 January 1772. The letters took a high
                        Whig line. They opposed the policies of the government and the king and were generally supportive of those of the ex-Prime
                        Minister George Grenville (1712–1770; <title>DNB</title>) and of the radical politician John Wilkes (1725–1797;
                            <title>DNB</title>). There was, from the outset, much debate as to the identity of their author or authors. In 1813
                        Duppa’s <title>Memoirs by a Celebrated Literary and Political Character</title> (i.e. Richard Glover (1712–1785;
                            <title>DNB</title>)) had attempted to prove the latter was the author of Junius’s letters. (Glover was the author of the
                        epic <title>Leonidas</title> (1737), a favourite poem of Southey’s.) Duppa defended himself against his critics in an
                        anonymous pamphlet, <title>An Inquiry Concerning the Author of the Letters of Junius, with Reference to the Memoirs by a
                            Celebrated Literary and Political Character</title> (1814).</note> – As a reviewer personal acquaintance influences me
                    this far, that I will never review a bad book by an author whom I know (Clarksons Life of Penn<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas Clarkson, <title>Memoirs of the Private and Public Life of William
                            Penn</title> (1813).</note> is an instance) – but it would be carrying delicacy to a ridiculous excess if I should abstain
                    from speaking well of a good one. A Journal cannot be free from partialities of this kind in a country where all the literary men
                    are known to each other as friends or enemies. As for Junius I am not solicitous about it, I have too much contempt for the
                    political history of those times to feel any interest in them, &amp; the time employed upon such a subject would not have been
                    well bestowed. Yet I would have done it, because it would have gratified <ref target="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppa</ref>. But I
                    think you are laying down for yourself a principle upon which it is impossible to proceed. To me personally it can be of little
                    consequence. I review little &amp; shall probably do less; &amp; subjects which have nothing to do with fine literature are most
                    to my taste.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey did not review Duppa’s contributions to the Junius controversy for

Instead he praised his achievements in an essay on Alexander Chalmers (1759–1834; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The
                            Works of the English Poets, from Chaucer to Cowper</title> (1810), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 11 (July 1814),
