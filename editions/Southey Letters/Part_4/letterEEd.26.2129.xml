                    adventure of the most tempting kind, &amp; for which he is every way qualified, – except so far as regards the means of supporting
                    two or three years of non-employment. Sealey<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Richard Sealy (1752–1821), merchant based in

                    person who knows <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> has any doubt of his success. He takes with him the
                    practice of all the great Northern families within his reach, who will employ him henceforth in the winter, instead of in the
                    summer.</p><p rend="indent1"> For myself I am returned to a renewal of labour, which must delay my intended visit to <ref target="places.html#Streatham">Streatham</ref> &amp; its vicinity. I found letters on my return stating that it was of the
                    greatest importance to the success of the Register,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1811</title> (1813).</note> &amp; perhaps essential to its continuance, that in future
                    it should be published in March instead of July. Now if I can be ready, no other person concerned can have any apology for delay.
                    My means of support are so vitally interested in the success of this work that I must not omit any effort which may further it. So
                    I recommence my labours without delay, – a heavy labour, – but one which I set about with a light heart &amp; a willing &amp;
                    strong spirit. The volume for 1810 is published,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1810</title> (1812).</note> &amp; will probably come to your hands before you are ready
                    for it. The debates are upon the same scale as in the two former years. I shall endeavour henceforward to reduce it, in order to
                    gain room for the <del>pen</del> affairs of the peninsula. You will see that I was obliged to defer the affairs of Spanish &amp;
                    South America till the ensuing year.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1811</title>, 4.1 (1813), 367–421.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> We are suffering much inconvenience from the failure of the Workington Bank<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        The Workington Bank, along with other country banks, had failed earlier in 1812. It is estimated that its customers lost
                        £105,000 in total.</note> which supplied almost the whole circulation of <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>. I
                    have thirty &lt;£&gt; of its notes; – at present the cry is that they are worth nothing, but I rather expect that they will prove
                    at least worth half-price.</p><p rend="indent1"> I found another piece of intelligence on my return of a pleasanter nature. The second edition of Kehama<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> The second edition of <title>The Curse of Kehama</title> had been published in 1811, a third
                        appeared in 1812.</note> is so nearly gone, that it is time to put another to press. This is for me, a rapid sale, &amp;
                    augurs well for the future. If the tide which has thus at last begun to flow should continue, another year will square my accounts
                    with <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref>, &amp; then I shall begin to derive some yearly income from a capital
                    of <del>xxx</del> labour which for many years has been almost unproductive. The sale of Kehama I attribute not to any merit of its
                    own, but to <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scotts</ref> account of it in the Quarterly,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> See <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 5 (February 1811), 40–61. However, Southey was not always as sanguine
                        about the potential or actual impact of the review, see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 1 January 1811, Letter
                        1848.</note> &amp; to the reputation which I have obtained by writing in the Quarterly myself. It is one of the many
                    absurdities of this age that a man obtains more credit for an article in the Review, than for the best work which he could
                    possibly produce upon the same subject, if his name were affixed to the volume. However it is of little consequence to me in what
                    manner the reputation has been obtained; in a fair way I am sure it has been, &amp; I am sure too that tho it does not rest upon
                    the proper ground, it is well deserved. All that concerns me is that it affects favourably the marketable value of my produce. I
                    shall be tempted by the success of Kehama to move a little faster with Pelayo.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> The early
                        incarnation of what became <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note></p><p rend="indent1"> I trouble you with the inclosed letter of thanks for Anchietas Grammar &amp; the Valeroso Lucideno,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Marcos de Noronha e Brito, Conde dos Arcos (1771–1828), Governor General of Bahia 30
                        September 1810–26 January 1818, had sent Southey copies of José de Anchieta (1534–1597), <title>Arte de Grammatica da Lingoa
                            mais Usada na Costa do Brasil</title> (1595) and Manuel Calado (1584–1654), <title>Valeroso Lucideno e o Triunfo da
                            Liberdade</title> (1648), a first-hand account of Brazil during the period of Dutch rule. Both had been on the list of
                        books wanted in Southey, <title>History of Brazil</title>, 3 vols (London, 1810–1819), I, p. [vi].</note> because I know not
                    how to send it, &amp; you can probably find means of conveying it to its destination by some channel which will prevent any charge
                    of postage, – an unseemly thing for a letter upon such an occasion. I should be much gratified if you could from time to time

                    present state of Brazilian literature may safely be given. There are a number of political brochures noticed in the Correio

                        1808–1822. It was critical of the Portuguese monarchy and advocated liberal ideas. Southey possessed a complete set, no. 3203
