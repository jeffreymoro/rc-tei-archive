                        <del>all</del> in the Appendix, unless its whole substance has been incorporated in the text.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey is discussing the arrangment of the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title> (1810). In
                            <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title>, 1.1 (1810) 42 state papers were published as an ‘Appendix’
                        (xix–ciii).</note> Even then where the <hi rend="ital">ipsissima verba</hi><note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> ‘Very
                        words’.</note> (as in treaties) are of consequence, they are afterwards added. But my opinion decidedly is that if there be
                    any such papers which are not noticed in the history, they ought nevertheless to be included in the Appendix, for by making the
                    Register a full &amp; faithful Repertory of these documents, you assure to it an undoubted &amp; permanent value. All the
                    periodical works which profess to record these papers are miserably, – most miserably – incomplete. – It would have been a great
                    satisfaction to me could I have obtained the Spanish proclamations &amp;c in the original, – some mistranslations I was able to
                    detect by guessing at what the Spanish phrase must have been, – &amp; most probably much of the force &amp; passion of the
                    language has been lost, which I perhaps might have been able to have transfused.</p><p rend="indent1"> With respect to the list of books,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title>, 1.2 (1810), i–xxxii contained a list of publications for 1808.</note> it
                    seems to be very desirable that it should be as complete as possible, – even to the most trivial pamphletts, – your Hist: of
                        Literature<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> ‘General Review of Literature’ in <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for
                            1808</title>, 1.2 (1810), 417–443.</note> for the year will preclude the necessity of any other criticism. The Catalogue
                    should be classed, &amp; may probably be comprized in a single sheet, – as it is of no consequence in how small a type it be
                    printed.</p><p rend="indent1"> Concerning the Biography,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> There was no Biographical Section in
                            <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title> (1810).</note> it appears to me that works of this kind <del>wer</del>
                    have hitherto partaken too much of the nature of Magazines, – that is to say, that great part of their contents might with equal
                    propriety have appeared in another place, – whereas it would be better if they confined themselves wholly to the affairs of the
                    year, every year being now abundantly fertile in materials. Instead therefore of promiscuous or arbitrary biography I should
                    recommend exclusively, the Necrology of the year, – persons enough who have made themselves remarkable are annually dropping off.
                    I do not mean any attempt at a general Obituary (for in that the Gent: Magazine is likely to remain unrivalled, &amp; one of the
                    kind is enough) – but merely the lives of remarkable persons, – &amp; if literary men, – a general review of their works may fitly
                    form a part. – I have promised to write a life of Nelson<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Life of Nelson</title> (1813), an expansion of Southey’s article in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 3 (February 1810),

                        did not arrive in time or was not used in the account published in <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title>, 1.1
