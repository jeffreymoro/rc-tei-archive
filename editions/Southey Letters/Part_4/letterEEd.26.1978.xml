                    doubt. I will give you only one caution, – do not be deterred from entering occasionally into the minutest details because they
                    may be trivial to you, &amp; to your contemporary countrymen; these things will be novelties to us, &amp; they will be history
                    hereafter, even in Spain itself. We in England love that life &amp; reality which fulness of costume gives to representation of
                    every kind, whether in painting or poetry, historical narrative, or the drama. The more of this life-painting that you give us,
                    the more willing will the reader be to follow you in your views &amp; feelings. It is a melancholy thing to reflect how many
                    valuable things have been lost to the world, because the persons who could have told them did not think them worth the
                    telling.</p><p rend="indent1"> Before I left London I was about to use my endeavours for stopping the abominable calumnies against you, which from
                    time to time found their way into the Times,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> For example, the attack on Blanco White’s
                        ‘criminal, immoral, and revolutionary conduct’ in a ‘Reply to the False and Injurious Ideas which the 12th number of the Paper
                        called El Espanol conveys of the Memorable Action of the 5th of March, in the Plains of Chiclana’, published in <title>The
                            Times</title>, 9 May 1811.</note> – greatly to my surprize, that being the only English newspaper which is thoroughly well
                    conducted upon independent principles. I had however the satisfaction to find that the work had been done, by the very person to
                    whom I applied, – I do not know whether you are acquainted with him, – <ref target="people.html#RobinsonHenryCrabb">Mr Henry
                        Robinson</ref>, – an excellent man, a thorough friend to all good principles, &amp; one of the best advocates whom the
                    Spaniards have had in England. He was at Coruña for some months in 1808, &amp; gave me tidings which I <del>was</del> rejoiced to
                    hear, that the man who by his writings, both in prose &amp; verse, contributed most to keep up the spirit of the Galicians, was
                    one who had been introduced as a philosopher &amp; a poet to me in 1795. – It was very delightful to me to find that a man who at
                    that time founded his hopes upon France, &amp; entertained views as enthusiastic &amp; ardent as my own, – should have coincided
                    as entirely <del>with</del> &lt;in&gt; feeling with me now, as he did then. – His name is Pardo, – he had been a friar, but had
                    walked to Rome to obtain a dispensation when I saw him, &amp; then lived as a secular Priest.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Manuel Pardo de Andrade (1760–1832). For Southey’s account of him see <title>Letters Written During a Short

                        argued that children should learn through activity and through things, rather than words. As part of this, children should be
