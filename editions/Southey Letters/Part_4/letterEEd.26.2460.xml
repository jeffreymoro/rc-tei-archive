                        October 1813 by James Smith (1775–1815). In 1814 Henry Colburn had asked to borrow a portrait of Southey, in order to produce
                        an engraving for the <title>New Monthly Magazine</title>. Not entirely satisfied with Southey’s response, he borrowed the bust
                        and ‘got someone to attempt the impossible task of making a portrait from it, which he engraved as an original picture: - a
                        miserable looking wretch it is – something in physiognomy between assassin &amp; hangman’. The offending engraving,
                        accompanied by a ‘long Memoir’, appeared in the <title>New Monthly Magazine</title>, 1 (January-July 1814), Frontispiece;
                        566–571. See also Southey to Henry Colburn, 5 June 1814, Letter 2434.</note> The delay must have been owing to <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> who had the management of the business, – but has lately lost <ref target="people.html#Bedfordfamily">his father</ref>, &amp; is himself at present laid up.

A Tragic Poem</title> (1814).</note> It has extended to 7000 lines. Most probably I
                    shall never write another poem so long, – perhaps never another so good. The length, among the present race of readers will be an
                    objection to it. I have not however thought of them, nor of any thing but of making the work as good as I can make it. It is
                    called a Tragic poem, <del>that</del> in order that passion rather than action may be expected from it, – &amp; it has this
                    character peculiar to it, that tho the story is deeply tragical, it is nowhere painful: for the characters with whom you
                    sympathize are in a state either of enthusiasm, or piety, or moral heroism which renders them more the objects of admiration than
                    of pity. It is not unlikely that the reestablished Inquisition<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> In 1814 the Spanish
                        Inquisition had been re-established by Ferdinand VII (1784–1833; King of Spain 1808, 1813–1833). It was permanently abolished
                        in 1834.</note> may do me the honour of inserting the title of this poem in the next edition of the Index Expurgatorius,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Index of books prohibited by the Catholic Church, maintained 1559–1966.</note> – for

                        (1767–1831).</note> nor what the expence was, but will learn both from <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref>.</p><p rend="indent1"> You ask me about Norway.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> Demark had been allied to France since 1807, but
                        by late 1813 was isolated and bankrupt. Consequently, on 14 January 1814, the Danes signed the Treaty of Kiel with Britain and
                        Sweden. Most importantly, it ceded Norway, which had been under Danish rule, to Sweden. The Norwegians responded with a
                        declaration of independence in May 1814, but Swedish troops were poised to invade the country, crossing the Norwegian border
                        on 29 July 1814. Eventually, the Norwegians agreed to union with Sweden.</note> I look upon the interest which has been
                    excited in this country concerning it as originating in mere faction. The case is exactly as if when Scotland &amp; England were
                    seperate <del>king</del> monarchies, the one had ceded to another a portion of its border territory as the price of peace at the
                    end of an unsuccesful war. In the state of our relations with Denmark, &amp; of Denmarks obstinate adherence to Buonaparte,
                    England &amp; her allies would have been clearly justified, if they had deprived Denmark of its existence as a Kingdom. A cession
                    like that of Norway is unjust if, as in the memorable instance of the Seven Reductions in Paraguay,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Treaty of Madrid (1750) settled the boundary between Portuguese and Spanish possessions in South America.
                        Seven Reductions, or settlements, founded by Spanish Jesuits, east of the Rio Uruguay were transferred to Portuguese territory
                        and the population was forced to relocate west of the river. Their resistance to this plan was crushed in a short campaign by
                        Spanish and Portuguese troops in 1756, called the Guarani War, or War of the Seven Reductions.</note> the inhabitants are to
                    be turned out of their own country; – if they are ceded to a state which professes a different &amp; intolerant religion, – or if
                    their situation is made by it &lt;in any way&gt; manifestly worse. In the present instance Denmark has a clear right to make the
                    cession, &amp; the Norwegians are not injured by it. I look upon the resistance as a manœuvre of the Danish court.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Norwegian independence movement was formally headed by Prince Christian Frederik (1786–1848),
                        the representative of the Danish monarchy in Sweden, but also the heir presumptive to the Danish throne, to which he later
                        succeeded as Christian VIII (1839–1848). This led to accusations that the whole movement was merely an attempt to maintain
                        Denmark’s hold on Norway.</note> Laws, manners, language, religion differ little in the two countries, what advantage there is
                    of civil institutions is on the side of Sweden; &amp; if you lay the map before a person who does not know to which power Norway
                    belongs, – he would from geographical fitness certainly assign it to Sweden. – Denmark (which also receives equivalent territory
                    &amp; restitutions in exchange) has not been half punished.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Treaty of Kiel (1814)
                        promised that Denmark would be compensated for the loss of Norway at the general peace following the final defeat of
                        Napoleon.</note> She has acted a wicked part, – witness Romanas army, &amp; witness Hamburgh.<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors"> Pedro Caro, 3rd Marquis of la Romana (1761–1811), was commander of the ‘Division of the North’, an Army which
                        Napoleon had compelled the Spanish government to contribute to his wars in north Germany. The Division was stationed in
                        Denmark when Napoleon invaded Spain in 1808. A majority of the troops managed to escape to Spain on British ships, but the
                        rest were interned in Denmark. The Danes continued to co-operate closely with French troops in north Germany until 1813,
                        including taking part in the re-occupation of Hamburg on 30 June 1813.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> In this new Quarterly I have an account of the Nicobar Islands,<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors"> Johann
