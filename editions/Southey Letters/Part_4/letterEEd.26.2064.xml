                    subject requires my reconsideration, – &amp; whenever the vol. of the Reg. in
                    question comes to be reprinted, (if that ever should be) – or wherever I may
                    have occasioned to refer again to the subject I will reconsider it with a fair
                    &amp; unprejudiced mind. At present I have no time for the enquiry, – &amp; to
                    say the truth, no inclination. My present impression is that <ref target="people.html#WellesleyMarquis">M Wellesley</ref> pursued in
                    India a vigorous &amp; wise system of policy, – but that he was not very
                    scrupulous about means, &amp; that some cases of cruelty appeared to be admitted
                    by his advocates. My opinion was formed upon the Debates &amp; the Parliamentary
                    Papers referrd to in the Register.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Marquis Wellesley had been governor-general of Bengal (1797–1805). After his
                        return to England, a controversy broke out about his government in India and
                        he was denounced in parliament by a coalition of radicals and personal
                        opponents. Wellesley was accused of ruining trade in Oudh and undermining
                        the authority of its ruler, Saadat Ali Kan II (c. 1752–1814; Nawab of Oudh
                        1798–1814). The motion to censure Wellesley was defeated by 182 votes to 31
                        on 15 March 1808. Southey summarised the debates in the <title>Edinburgh
                            Annual Register, for 1808</title>, 1.1 (1810), 133–137. Dr Knighton had
                        presumably expressed his reservations about Southey’s account and suggested
                        revisions to it.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> How are you going on? – Be sure I shall rejoice to hear from you
