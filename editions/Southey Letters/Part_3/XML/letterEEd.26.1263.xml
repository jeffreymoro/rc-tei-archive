                        concerned with the preface to <title>Specimens of the Later English Poets</title> (1807), the anthology which Southey was
                        editing with Bedford.</note> How comes it man that thou who hast often enough a smile upon thy own face wilt never allow me to
                    have one upon mine when I am writing in my authoritative capacity? Who can think of King James without thinking of King Solomon? –
                    if one does not mention <del>with</del> &lt;him with&gt; contempt one must with abhorrence, &amp; I incline to the side of
                        mercy.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey mocks the pedantry of King James I’s (1566–1625; reigned 1603–1625;
                            <title>DNB</title>) rules for Scots poetry, by contrast with Solomonic wisdom, in the preface to <title>Specimens of the
                            Later English Poets</title>, 3 vols (London, 1807), I, pp. viii–ix.</note> – There is a fitness in the word unreadably –
                    which by the by is to be found in many a modern book – however not withstanding the sentence subscribed thereunto you may
                    substitute intolerably if your Worship pleases.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The phrase ‘unreadably dull’ describes
                        Henry More’s (1614–1687; <title>DNB</title>) ‘Song of the Soul’, in the preface to <title>Specimens of the Later English
                            Poets</title>, 3 vols (London, 1807), I, p. xxv.</note> The passage relating to Milton must stand: it means his Defence of
                    the People of England ‘Libertys defence’ – as he himself calls it in the former part of the line quoted.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> This passage concerning Milton and his times does not appear in <title>Specimens of the Later English
                            Poets</title>.</note> nor if it meant <hi rend="ital">Regicide</hi> alias <hi rend="ital">Rascalicide</hi><del>xxxxx</del> exclusively, should I alter it, as it is not irrelevant, but on the contrary, essential in this place, as one
                    cause of the neglect of his great poem. – The Creed is not mentioned disrespectfully [MS obscured] the passage again &amp; you
                    will see this – it is coupled with the Paradise Lost – as what people believe – &amp; ought to believe – but cannot comprehend –
                    This is its meaning – if more be looked for in it than ought to be looked for, – for certainly I do not mean to imply that belief
                    in myself.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The passage concerning the Creed stood: ‘Every-body believes in the merit of
                            <title>Paradise Lost</title> as they believe in their Creed, and in ninety-nine instances out of a hundred, with as little
                        comprehension of the mysteries of the one as of the other’. See the preface to <title>Specimens of the Later English
