                    before these, in which I have an interest, will bring me in anything, but they will go off in time. I am startled at the price of
                        Madoc<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Madoc</title> (1805) cost 2 guineas.</note> – not that it is dear compared
                    with other books, but it is too much money, &amp; I vehemently suspect that in consequence the sale will be just sufficient for
                    the publisher not to lose anything – &amp; for me not to gain any thing.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> Sales of
                            <title>Madoc</title> were modest. At the end of 1815 five copies of the first edition (of 500 copies) were still unsold.
                        Southey’s profits from the first edition were: £3, 17s, 1d in 1805, and £22, 2s, 4½d, in 1806.</note> What will be its
                    critical reception I cannot anticipate – there is neither metre nor politics to offend any body, &amp; it may pass free for any
                    matter that it contains – unless, indeed, some wise acre should suspect me of favouring the Roman Catholic religion.</p><p rend="indent1"> And this catch word<del>s</del> leads me to the great political question. A Catholic establishment would be the
                    best – perhaps the only – means of civilising Ireland. Jesuits &amp; Benedictines, tho they would not enlighten the savages, would
                    humanise them, &amp; bring the country into cultivation. A petition that asked for this – saying plainly we are Papists &amp; will
                    be so, &amp; this is the best thing that can be done for us &amp; for you too, – such a petition I could support, considering what
                    the present condition of Ireland is – how wretchedly it always has been governed – &amp; and how hopeless the prospect is. But the
                    present Petition is comparatively trifling in its object – &amp; positively false in its assertions. the petitioners who have
                    signed it, may possibly hold such tenets as they profess – but those are not the tenets of the Catholic church – never were &amp;
                    never can be. Their canons, their councils, their doctors all teach a different creed – so most certainly do the Irish clergy –
                    always – since the downfall of the Culdees<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> Ascetic Christian monastic and eremitical
                        orders of Ireland and Britain which flourished from the eighth to the twelfth century, during which they were brought under
                        Roman Catholic rule.</note> &amp; the triumph of the Romanists, – the most superstitious of Europe.</p><p rend="indent1"> You will laugh at me – but I believe there is more need to check Popery in England than to encourage it in Ireland.
                    It was highly proper to let the emigrant monastics associate together here &amp; live in their old customs – but it is not proper
                    to let them continue their establishments, – nor proper that the children of protestant parents should be inveigled into
                    nunneries. You will tell me their vows are not binding in England – but they are binding in foro conscientiæ<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"> Meaning ‘before the tribunal of the conscience’.</note> – &amp; believe me <del>xxx</del>
                    whatever romances have related of the artifices of the Romish priesthood does not &amp; cannot exceed the truth. This by God’s
                    blessing I will one day prove irrefragably to the world. – The Protestant Dissenters will die away. destroy the test act<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Test Acts, passed in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, designated that all who
                        hold public office, including those in universities, must swear allegiance to the monarch as head of the Church of England,
                        and declare their disbelief in transubstantiation, invocation of saints, and the sacrifice of the mass. The Acts excluded
                        Catholics but also many Protestant dissenters from office (although in practice dissenters were indemnified from the penalties
                        incurred).</note> &amp; you kill them. they affect to appeal wholly to reason &amp; bewilder themselves in the miserable
                    snares of materialism – besides this creed is not reasonable – it is a vile mingle-mangle which a Catholic may well laugh at. But
                    Catholicism, having survived the first flood of reformation – will stand – perhaps till the end of all things. It would yield
                    either to a general spread of knowledge (which would require a totally new order of things) – or to the unrestrained attacks of
                    infidelity, – which would be casting out Devils by Beelzebub the Prince of the Devils. But if it be tolerated here – if the old
                    laws of prevention be suffered to sleep – it will gain ground, perhaps to a dangerous extent. You do not know what the zeal is,
                    and what the power of an army of priests – having no interest whatever but that of their order. Were the country in a state of
                    revolution I would vote against all religious establishments as contrary to the spirit of Xianity. As the country now is, &amp; as
                    the minds of men now are I would vote against Catholic emancipation, &amp; frame new tests to shut out the Methodists.</p><p rend="indent1"> You will not carry the question now. what you may do in the next reign, Heaven knows<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors"> Catholic emancipation had been promised to the Irish by William Pitt (1759–1806; <title>DNB</title>), Prime

                            <title>DNB</title>) refused to sanction the measure, convinced it would violate his coronation oath. With Pitt back in
                        power in 1805, emancipation remained an issue, although it was clear that no government could carry it against the King’s
                        opposition. Emancipation was achieved in the next reign, of George IV (1762–1830, reigned 1820–1830; <title>DNB</title>) in
