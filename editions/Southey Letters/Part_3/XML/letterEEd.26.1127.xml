                    the Courier – which you would know to be mine tho with no signature – &amp; saw how they silenced me at last with a positive assurance that the sailors were to have their full share as usual.<note n="20" place="foot" resp="editors"> In December 1804, the naval ship HMS <hi rend="ital">Amelia</hi>, of which
                        Thomas Southey was a lieutenant, had captured the Spanish brig <hi rend="ital">Isabella</hi> and the ship <hi rend="ital">Conception</hi>, both laden with wine and brandy, and the ship <hi rend="ital">Commerce</hi>, laden with cotton. It was
                        customary for naval officers to be allotted a share of the value of ships and cargo captured in armed conflict, but in this
                        case the prize money was contested because the ships were captured before war was officially declared. Southey took up his
                        brother’s cause to have his share of the prize money reinstated and <title>The Courier</title> published a paragraph
                        supporting the sailors’ claim to the prize-money on Saturday 24 August 1805. This was followed by a longer defence of their
                        position in <title>The Courier</title> on 31 August 1805 under the title ‘Indemnification to the Spanish Merchants’. A ‘reply from a
                        Spanish merchant’ appeared in <title>The Courier</title> for 6 September 1805. Southey’s response, that the prize money was
                        being withheld from the sailors in a measure that was ‘impolitic, ungenerous and unjust’ was published in <title>The
                            Courier</title> of 25 September 1805, p. 2. This was refuted by an editorial article in <title>The Courier</title> of 28
                        September 1805, where it was stated that there was no truth in Southey’s assertion.</note>  If Government
                    means to deprive them of it, it is evidently ashamed to do it openly. – You told me in one of your letters that I judged too
