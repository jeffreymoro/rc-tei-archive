I shall not condole with you on the daughtership, because
                    (tho it would be an error <del>xxxxxx</del> deserving of flogging to deny that the masculine gender is more worthy than the
                    feminine) there are many things in which girls are preferable to boys.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Rickman’s daughter
                        was named Ann. She later became Mrs Lefroy, but her husband’s first name is unknown.</note> They begin to be useful just when
                    boys begin to be troublesome, you have them longer for companions, &amp; moreover &lt;the cost of&gt; a boys education is a girls
                    fortune. <ref target="people.html#RickmanSusannah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Rickman</ref> I daresay is well satisfied with the sex,
                    – or if she is not she will soon find cause to be so. Boys about a house are like <del>an</del> favourite dogs in the country, who
                    come &lt;into the parlour&gt; <del>xx</del> with dirty legs, &amp; then lie down upon the hearth to lick themselves clean, – they
                    are always in the way, – &amp; when out of sight ten to one but they are in mischief. Girls are like cats, clean &amp; fit to be
                    up stairs.</p><p rend="indent1"> I brought with me from London an Italian life of Amerigo Vespucci, &amp; a MS. Eulogy upon him in the same
                        language,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> This eulogy, denying that Columbus discovered America and promoting the
                        navigational and astronomical achievements of Vespucci (1451–1512), aroused great controversy. It was given by Florentine
                        librarian Father Stanislaus Canovai (1740–1811) and published as <title>Elogio d’Amerigo Vespucci che ha riportato il premio
                            della nobile Accademia Etrusca di Cortona nel dì 15. Ottobre dell’anno 1788. Con una dissertazione giustificativa di
                            questo celebre navigator</title> (1788).</note> – which <ref target="people.html#FoxElizabethVassall">Lady Holland</ref>
                    got from the author in Italy. <del>Xxxx th</del> With the life Amerigos Letters are published in Italian, &amp; one letter added
                    which never appeared before, &amp; which I strongly suspect to be a Florentine forgery, for <del>it</del> in it he describes
                    himself as having just invented the Lunar Observation. No satisfactory account is given of the MS. &amp; the astronomy of the
                    other letters is utterly unintelligible (I am no astronomer, – but it is admitted to be so –) Does the <ref target="people.html#BurneyJames">Capitaneus</ref> know anything about this? It is manifest that the Florentines are wilfully
                    bent upon magnifying Amerigo into a great man, – &amp; it is equally manifest to me, upon diligent perusal of his letters, that he
                    is much more truly represented as a crafty one, who wished to appropriate to himself <del>th</del> the reputation which he had
                    only a right to share, &amp; that in no great ratio.</p><p rend="indent1"> There is a book written not long since by a Majorcan to prove that his countryman Raymond Lully <del>xxxxxxxx the
                        xxxx</del> invented the compass.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Antonio Raymundo Pasqual (1708–1791),

                            el Adelantamiento en las Artes y Ciencias</title> (1789). Ramon Llull (anglicised as Raymond Lully; 1232–1315), a Majorcan
                        philosopher whom Pasqual credited with discovering the compass needle on the grounds that it is mentioned in his <title>Arte
                            de Navegar</title> (1295).</note> I opened it with some expectations of finding something there, tho the needle is
                    mentioned before Lullys time, – but I found a very nonsensical illogical worthless affair, – &amp; what is very odd I found that
                    the author of the book imagined the needle points South, on the other side of the line, &amp; supposed that Lully foresaw

                    which is worth your looking at. Of the later French Romance this is the best specimen, being the very worst; – indeed more
                    incomparably absurd than any person would suppose possible. I read it <del>about</del> sixteen years ago, at an age when I could
                    afford time to read books which nobody else read, &amp; had luckily brains enough to remember them when <del>xxxx</del> such
                    reading came to be of use. I have six or seven of these Romances, &amp; mean to make them pay interest for their carriage at some

                        throughout. The following notice appeared in<title> British Critic</title>, 31 (April, 1808), 460: ‘We have received, through
