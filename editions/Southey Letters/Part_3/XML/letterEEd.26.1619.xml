                    done before this time had all things been going on well with me. I had <ref target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">a daughter</ref>
                    born on the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of last month; a few days after the birth <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">her
                        mother</ref> was taken ill with an attack of dysentery, &amp; for some time there was cause of serious alarm. This God be
                    thanked is over. The night before last we had another alarm of the worst-kind, tho happily this also is passing away. My <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">little boy</ref> went to bed with some slight indications of a trifling cold. His <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">mother</ref> went up to look at him before supper, – she thought he coughed in a strange
                    manner, – called me, – &amp; I instantly recognized the sound of the croop. We have a good <ref target="people.html#EdmondsonDr">apothecary</ref> within three minutes walk &amp; luckily he was at home. He immediately confirmed our fears, – the child was
                    taken out of bed &amp; bled in the jugular vein, – a blister placed on the throat next morning, &amp; by these rigorous &amp;
                    timely remedies, we hope &amp; trust the disease is subdued. But what a twelve-hours did we pass, knowing the nature of the
                    disease &amp; only hoping the efficacy of the remedy. – Even now I am far – very far from being at ease. There is a love which
                    passeth the love of women,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> 2 <title>Samuel</title> 1:26.</note> &amp; which is more
                    lightly alarmed than the wakefullest jealousy.</p><p rend="indent1"><ref target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landor</ref> I am not a Stoic at home. – I feel as you do about the fall of an old
                    tree – but O Christ what a pang it is to look upon the young shoot &amp; think it will be cut down! – And this is the thought
                    which almost <del>all</del> at all times haunts me, – it comes upon me in moments when I know not whether the tears that start are
                    of love or of bitterness. There is an evil too in seeing all things like a poet, – circumstances which would glide over a
                    healthier mind, sink into mine, – every thing comes &lt;to&gt; me with its whole force, <del>&amp; xxx</del> – the full meaning of
                    a look – a gesture, a childs imperfect speech, I can perceive &amp; cannot help perceiving, – &amp; thus am I made to remember
                    what I would give the world to forget.</p><p rend="indent1"> Enough &amp; too much of this. <del>The xxx</del> The leaven of anxiety is working in my whole system, – I will try
                    to quieten it by forcing myself to some other subject.</p><p rend="indent1"> What prevented Gebir<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"><ref target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landor’s</ref> poem <title>Gebir</title> (1798).</note> from being read by the
                    foolish? I believe the main reason was that it was too hard for them, more than that it was too good. That they should understand
                    its merits was not be expected, – but <del>that</del> they did not find meaning enough upon the surface to make them fancy they
                    understood it. Why should you not write <del>xxx</del> a poem as good &amp; more intelligible, &amp; display the same powers upon
                    a happier subject? Yet certain it is that Gebir excited far more attention than you seem to be aware of. Two manifest imitations
                    have appeared – <ref target="people.html#RoughWilliam">Rough’s</ref> play of the Conspiracy of Gowrie,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Conspiracy of Gowrie</title> (1800).</note> &amp; the first part of Sothebys Saul.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Sotheby (1757–1833; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Saul</title> (1807).</note> When <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> published his Juvenal,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> William
                        Gifford, <title>The Satires of Juvenal</title> (1802).</note> one of the most base attacks that ever disgraced a literary
                    journal was made upon it in the Critical Review by some one of the heroes of <del>the</del> his Baviad.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> In earlier life Gifford had been the author of two powerful verse satires <title>The Baviad</title> (1791) and
                        <title>The Mӕviad</title> (1795).</note><ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> who gives way to all sort of violence in his writings, wrote a desperate
                    reply in which he brought forward all the offences of the Review for many years back,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>An Examination of the Strictures of the Critical Reviewers on the Translation of Juvenal</title> (1803).</note> – &amp;
                    one of those offences was its praise of Gebir. I laughed when I heard this, guessing pretty well at the nature of <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Giffords</ref> feelings, – for I had been the reviewer of whose partiality he
                        complained.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey’s review appeared in the <title>Critical Review</title>, 27
                        (September 1799), 29–39.</note> Gebir came to me with a parcel of other poems which I was to kill off – I was young in the
                    trade &amp; reviewed it injudiciously, – so that every body supposed it to be done by some friend of the author. For I analysed
                    the story, studded it with as many beautiful extracts as they would allow room for, praised its merit almost up to the height of
                    my feeling, – &amp; never thought of telling the reader that if he went to the book itself, he would find any more difficulty in
                    comprehending it than he found in that abstract. Thus instead of serving the poem I in reality injured it. The world now-a-days
                    never believes praise to be sincere – they are so accustomed to hunt for faults that they will not think any person can honestly
                    express unmingled admiration.</p><p rend="indent1"> I once past an evening with Professor Young<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas Young (1773–1829;
                            <title>DNB</title>), physician and natural philosopher.</note> at <ref target="people.html#DavyHumphry">Davys</ref>. The
                    conversation was wholly scientific, &amp; of course I was a listener. But I have heard the history of Thomas Young as he is still
                    called by those who knew him when he was a Quaker &amp; believe him to be a very able man, but not of the best class. Generally
                    speaking I have little liking for men of science, – their pursuits seem to deaden their imagination &amp; harden their heart. –
                    they are so accustomed to analyse &amp; <hi rend="ital">anatomize</hi> every thing, – to understand or fancy they understand
                    whatever comes before them, that they <del>fre</del> most frequently become mere materialists, account for every thing by
                    mechanism &amp; motion, &amp; would put out of the world all that makes the world endurable – I do not undervalue their knowledge
                    nor the utility of their discoveries, – but I do not like the men. My own nature requires something more than they teach, – it
                    pants after things unseen, it exists upon the hope of that better futurity which all its aspirations promise &amp; seem to prove.
                    God knows I do not begin to be aweary of the sun,<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Macbeth</title>, Act IV, scene v, line 54.</note> – &amp; yet the wish which I most frequently express is that the
                    century were over, &amp; that I &amp; mine had all reached our havens of eternal rest.</p><closer><salute rend="indent1"> God bless you</salute><signed rend="indent2"> RS.</signed></closer><postscript><p><date when="1809-04-27">April 27.</date></p></postscript></div></body></text></TEI>
