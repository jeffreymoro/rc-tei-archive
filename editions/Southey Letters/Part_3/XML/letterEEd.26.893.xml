                        Earl of Derwentwater (1689–1716; <title>DNB</title>), was an illegitimate descendant of Charles II (1630–1685, King of Great
                        Britain 1660–1685; <title>DNB</title>). He fought in the 1715 Jacobite uprising, and after his capture at the Battle of Preston,
                        was executed the following year. His wife, Lady Derwentwater (d. 1723), was supposed to have thrown her jewels in the lake
                        rather than see them confiscated by the Crown, which nevertheless took the family’s estate. The ballad Southey refers to was
                        commonly sung in Cumbria and the Scottish borders. The text, reproduced in Francis Child (1825–1896; <title>DNB</title>),

                        despite being excommunicated continued to live with her until she died (pp. 4–5). Owain was the Welsh king of Gwynedd who
                        fought Henry II of England (1133–1189; reigned 1154–1189; <title>DNB</title>), and fathered the legendary prince Madoc, hero
                        of Southey’s poem, which begins with the strife that followed Owain’s death. The disinterment is mentioned in

                        composers of the day. These were published in <title>Select Scottish Airs</title> (1793), with further volumes, including more
                        Burns' songs, following in 1798, 1799, 1802, 1818–1826 and 1841. Thomson also produced volumes of Welsh and Irish airs in the
                        same way. Among the composers featured were Ignace Joseph Pleyel (1757–1831), (Franz) Joseph Haydn (1732–1809;
