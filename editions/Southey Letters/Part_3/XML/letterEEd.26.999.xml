                        on 14 August 1804, made an unsuccessful attempt to cut out the French privateer <hi rend="ital">General Ernouf</hi> (formerly
                        the British sloop of war <hi rend="ital"> Lilly</hi>) lying at the Saintes near Guadeloupe. Of the 90 men sent on the mission,
                        65 were killed or wounded, and Southey suspected that his brother was among the dead. Thomas was the first lieutenant, but was
                        absent from the raid because he had been placed under arrest. Charles Hayman (d. 1804) was made first lieutenant in his stead
                        and died in the attack.</note> – indeed it seems so certain that there is barely hope enough left to torment me, &amp; to give
                    me a second shock when it shall be destroyed.</p><p rend="indent1"> When you were here you were talking how time draws closer the <del>ties</del> natural ties. I have been very
                    unfortunate in mine. There is now not one person left <del>with whom I can</del> &lt;who can&gt; talk with me of my childhood, –
                    not one who nurst me in infancy, or played with me in my fathers house. What a desolating <del>feeling</del> thought is this! to
                    have so many feelings &amp; recollections which no being on earth can participate.</p><p rend="indent1"> No man was ever more contented with his lot than I am, for few have ever had more enjoyments, &amp; none had ever
                    better or worthier hopes. Life therefore is sufficiently dear to me, &amp; long life <del>most</del> desirable, that I may
                    accomplish all which I design. But yet I could be well content that the next century were over, &amp; my part fairly at an end,
                    having been gone well thro. <del>to the xxx</del> Just as at school one wished the school days over, tho we were happy enough
                    there, because we expected more happiness &amp; more liberty when we were to be our own masters, <del>how we</del> might lie as
                    much later in the morning as we pleased, have no bounds &amp; no exercise<del>s</del>; – just so do I wish that my exercise were
                    over, that that ugly chrysalis state were passed thro which we must all come, &amp; that I had just burst my shell &amp; got into
                    the new world <del>whe</del> with <del>my</del> wings upon my shoulders, or some inherent power like the wishing cap – which would
                    annihilate <del>space</del> all the inconveniences of space.</p><p rend="indent1"> Restoration of all that was ever beloved is to form one of the main blessings of finer happiness in heaven,
                    according to your Bards, or mine I may say for I have a claim to be affiliated by them. I do think it very probable that their
                    system as it appears in the Triads,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Welsh sayings collected in groups of three lines, the
                        earliest of which predate Saxon times. Preserved in different versions, partly in the fourteenth century White Book of
                        Rhydderch and Red Book of Hergest, the triads were associated with bardic recitation. They include stories of King Arthur and
                        of Llywarch Hen (whom Southey would discuss in his 1829 text <title>Sir Thomas More: or Colloquies on the Progress and
                            Prospects of Society</title>). Southey cited the triads in the preface to <title>Madoc</title> (1805) from the translation
                        of Edward Williams (Iolo Morganwg; 1747–1826; <title>DNB</title>) in his <title>Poems, Lyric and Pastoral</title>
                        (1794).</note> is the patriarchal belief – in other words the real &amp; true faith – either revealed to the first inhabitants
                    of this orb if there were a new creation for it, or brought with them from some other if they were exploded to colonize
                        <del>here</del> this. I have made too little use of this in Madoc, not having then thought of it or felt it enough. The system
                    of progressive existence seems of all others the most benevolent, &amp; all that we do understand is so wise &amp; so good, &amp;
                    all that we do or do not so perfectly &amp; overwhelmingly wonderful, that the most benevolent system is the most probable.</p><p rend="indent1"> I could write you a long letter upon this – but I did not begin to write with this object. – Whenever any thing
