                        inventing the mariner’s compass by suspending the needle over a design on which the cardinal points were indicated. Modern
                        scholarship doubts Flavio’s existence.</note> Now have I just found it mentioned in the Laws of Alonso the Wise, which laws
                    were begun AD 1251 &amp; finished in seven years,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Alfonso X (1221–1284), known as ‘El

                        (Seven-Part Code) or <title>Libro de las Leyes</title>, a comprehensive legal code, was compiled during his reign. No. 3610 of
                        the sale catalogue of Southey’s library was <title>Las Siete Partidas del Sabio Rey Don Alonso el Nono</title> (1789).</note>
                    – &amp; it is not mentioned as any thing new, but made use of as an illustration – you can understand the Spanish.</p><p rend="indent1"> – assi como los marineros se guiar en la noche escura por el aguja, que los es medianera entre la piedra e las

                        way in the dark night with the needle, which stands between the stone and the stars, and shows them where they are
                        going’.</note> –</p><p rend="indent1"> I suspect that this implies a belief in some specific virtue in the North star as if the magnetic influence flowed
                    from it. – this however is matter for more enquiry, &amp; I will one day look into it in Raymund Lully &amp; Albertus Magnus,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Ramon Llull (anglicised as Raymond Lully; 1232–1315), a Majorcan philosopher, and author of
                            <title>Arte de Navegar</title> (1295) which described the use of compasses in navigation. St Albertus Magnus
                        (1193/1206–1280), a German Aristotelian philosopher. His <title>Opera Omnia</title> (1651) included works of geography and
                        astronomy.</note> – likely authors. – The passage certainly <del>xxx</del> carries the use of the needle half a century
                    farther back than this poor chronology – but whether I have made what antiquarians call a discovery – is more than I can tell.

                        leads to speculation on the minute divisions of time.</note> &amp; K Alfonso has ingeniously settled the orthography of his
                    name by beginning each of the seven parts with one of the seven letters which compose it, in succession. – his Majesty gives
                    direction that no young prince should dip their fingers into the dish in an unmannerly way – so as to grease themselves – &amp;
                    expatiates on the advantage which they may derive from reading &amp; writing – if they are able to learn those arts. He was
                    himself an extraordinary man. Too fond of study to be a good king in a barbarous age. – but therefore not only a more interesting
                    character to posterity, but a more useful one in the long run.</p><p rend="indent1"> You will see in the Madociana a story how Alexander went down in a diving bell to see what was going on among the
                    fishes, – remarkable because it is found in Spanish, German &amp; <hi rend="ital">Welsh</hi> romance of the middle ages.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> For Southey’s discussion of the sources of the story of the diving bell; see Southey to
                        John Rickman, 29 April 1804, Letter 929. The story appears in the notes to <title>Madoc</title>, Part 1, Book 11, 106 where
                        Merlin is credited with having a ‘crystal Ark’. See <title>Robert Southey: Poetical Works 1793–1810</title>, gen. ed. Lynda
                        Pratt, 5 vols (London, 2004), II, pp. 78, 303–306, 581.</note> I have since found a similar story of somebody else among the
                    Malays – who certainly did not get it from Europe – or Alexander (Iscander)<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> Alexander the
                        Great (356–323 BC) was reputed to have used a diving bell. In <title>Madoc</title> Southey cites the thirteenth-century author
                        Joan Lorenzo Segura de Astorga (dates unknown), <title>Libro de Alexandre</title> as a source of the story.</note> would have
                    been their hero also. The number of good stories of all kinds which are common to the Orientals &amp; Europeans, are more likely
                    to have been brought home by peaceable travellers than by the Crusaders. I suspect the Jew-pedlars were the great literary
                    go-betweens. They always went every where. – all the world over you found Jew merchants &amp; Jew physicians. Wherever there is
                    any thing to be got no danger deters a Jew from venturing. I myself saw two fellows at Evora<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey passed through Evora, Portual, on donkey-back in April 1801. See letter 577 of this edition.</note> –
                    under the very nose of the Inquisition – who if they had any noses could not have been mistaken their game – I knew the cut of
                    their jibs at once – &amp; upon enquiring what they had for sale was told – green spectacles. A history of the Jews since their
                    dispersion in the shape of a chronological Bibliotheca would be a very valuable work – I want an Academy established to bespeak
                    such works, &amp; reward them well according to the diligence wherewith they shall be executed.</p><p rend="indent1"> The abuses – or main abuses of Printing spring from one evil. it almost immediately made authorship a trade. –

                    destroying the Monastic Orders it deprived us of the only bodies of men <del>xxxxxx</del> who could not possibly be injured by

                    – they laboured hard for amusement, – the society had funds to spare for printing, &amp; felt a pride in this disposing of them to
                    the reputation of their order – We laugh at the ignorance of these orders, but [MS obscured] the most worthless &amp; most

                    Benedictine monastery than he could at Cambridge – certainly better than he could at Oxford. You know I am no friend to Popery or
                    to Monachism. but if the Irish Catholics are to be emancipated, I would let them found Convents – only restricting them from
