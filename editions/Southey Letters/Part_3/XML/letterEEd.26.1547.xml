                        This society, later renamed the Church Missionary Society, was founded 12 April 1799.</note> with which <ref target="people.html#WilberforceWilliam">Wilberforce</ref> the Thorntons<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Henry
                        Thornton (1760–1815; <title>DNB</title>) and his wife Marianne, née Sykes (1765–1815; <title>DNB</title>), members of the
                        evangelical Clapham sect and founders of the Church Missionary Society.</note> &amp; their party are particularly connected.
                    Of this Society I have never before heard, – so ill have they advertised themselves. There is a volume of their proceedings
                    published by Seeley in Ave Maria Lane,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The <title>Proceedings of the Church Missionary
                            Society</title> became a long-running series, published by L. B. Seeley (1766–1834).</note> which I shall be obliged to
                    you to procure, &amp; also a Grammar &amp; Vocabulary of the Susoo language by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Brunton the Missionary,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Henry Brunton (c. 1770–1813), worked as a missionary in Sierra Leone from 1797–1801. He
                        published, on his return, a grammar of the Susu language, spoken along on the coast of West Africa: <title>A Grammar and
                            Vocabulary of the Susoo Language, to which are added, the names of some of the Susoo towns ... a small catalogue of Arabic
                            books, and a list of names of some of the learned men of the Mandinga and Foulah countries</title> (1802).</note> – which
                    may probably be had or heard of at the same place, tho I know not to what Society he belongs; – either to this I believe or to the
                    old sleeping one for the Propagation of the Gospel.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Brunton belonged to the Edinburgh
                        Missionary Society, rather than the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (founded 1701).</note> With
                    these I should be glad of David Brainerds Journal.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> David Brainerd (1718–1747). The
                            <title>Journal</title> of his mission among the American Indians was published in 1746.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> I am sorry to trouble you a second time upon the same business, but I replied in haste to your letter,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> For this, see Southey to John Murray, 23 November 1808, Letter 1541.</note> a few hours only
                    after the parcel arrived, &amp; seeing the word Sermon upon one of the bundles, left it to be opened the last of the assortment.
                    The subject is of great importance, &amp; it will be a great satisfaction to me if I should be able to bring into one view what
                    these various Societies have done towards the accomplishment of their specific object, &amp; what they have added to the stock of
                    general knowledge. Our Propagandists will bear comparison with the Jesuits in their best days, – &amp; instead of deriding them
                    for that zeal &amp; that enthusiasm without which nothing great &amp; good has ever yet been accomplished it behoves us to hold
                    them up to the gratitude &amp; admiration of the Christian world, &amp; to plead for the end at which they aim, while we speculate
                    with full &amp; entire freedom upon the means which they employ.</p><closer><salute rend="indent1"> Yrs respectfully </salute><signed rend="indent2"> Robert Southey.</signed></closer><postscript><p><address><placeName><ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>.</placeName></address><date when="1808-12-02">Dec. 2. 1808.</date></p></postscript></div></body></text></TEI>
