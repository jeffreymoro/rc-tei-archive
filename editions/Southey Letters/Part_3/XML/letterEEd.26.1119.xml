                        of 23 December 1798 , Taylor revealed that he, like Southey, had written a poem on the theme of the ‘Old Woman of Berkeley’
                        (J.W. Robberds (ed.), <title>A Memoir of the Life and Writings of the Late William Taylor of Norwich</title>, 2 vols (London,
                        1843), I, p. 235). This poem, entitled ‘A Tale of Wonder’ was written about 1791, but remained unpublished for many years
                        until its appearance in the Iris, the weekly Norwich newspaper edited by Taylor, on 29 October 1803. Southey wanted to
                        republish the poem with his own ‘Old Woman of Berkeley’ but Taylor declined the offer and it was published in the
                            <title>Monthly Magazine</title> 34 (1812), 234–236. See David Chandler, ‘Southey’s “German Sublimity” and Coleridge’s
                        “Dutch Attempt”‘, in <title>Romanticism on the Net</title>, 32–33 (November 2003).</note> which if I thought any body else
                    would say it would give me real concern. That my Old Woman<note n="18" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey’s ‘A Ballad Shewing
                        how an Old Woman Rode Double and Who Rode Before Her’, (more familiarly known as ‘The Old Woman of Berkeley’) was published in
                            <title>Poems</title>, 2 vols (Bristol, 1799), II, pp. [143]–160. Taylor was now declining Southey’s request that the two
                        poems might be published together in the new 1806 edition of his <title>Poems</title> (1799).</note> is the best ballad of the
                    two I never should never effect to doubt – but were there any legitimate ground for comparison I never should have wished to place
                    them together. My wish was to show &lt;how&gt; very differently the same subject may be treated – how the same <del>sand</del>
                    plant varies under different circumstances of climate &amp; culture –. Mine is the ballad of a ballad-maker believing the whole
                    superstition – &amp; thereby making even the grotesque terrible; – yours that of a poet decorating a known fable – laughing behind
                    a masque of fear. Mine has no invention – not an atom, yet wants none, – it is the legend in verse. yours a story of your own,
                    &amp; the thought of the bottomless grave of novel &amp; excellent value. I will far rather forego the pleasure it really would
                    give me to see it on good paper &amp; in fair type, than suffer you to suspect me of something whereof I should be most deeply
