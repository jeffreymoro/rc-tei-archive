                        junior member for Seaford, one of the Cinque Ports; he never spoke in the house, and did not stand for re-election. His ‘fashionable fame’ related to his literary collaboration

                    if he be at all an odd fish, &amp; sometimes such odd things as may flow from the quaintness of my heart. This costs me a journey to London, as at least half these Gentlemen are
                    not included in the common Collections of the Poets – &amp; must be resurrectionized at Stationers Hall,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Near Ludgate Hill, in the City

                    if his mind were as well regulated as mine the body would be quite as manageable. I am perpetually pained &amp; mortified by thinking what he ought to be, for mine is an eye of
                    microscopic discernment to the faults of my friends, but the tidings of his death would come upon me more like a stroke of lightning than any evil I have ever yet endured. almost
