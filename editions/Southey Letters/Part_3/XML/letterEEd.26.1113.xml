                    were willing to get home again. It is certainly a magnificent city. The new town resembles Bath in the regularity, the cleanliness
                    &amp; the silence of its streets, &amp; in the colour of the buildings; but the houses being only of ordinary height are dwarfed
                    by the old city. There they are commonly six seven or eight stories on the one side – ten – twelve or thirteen on the other –
                    &amp; this height increased by the chimneys which rise like a sort of turret from the front of the house instead of the gable end.
                    The famous view of Leith<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> A district in the north of Edinburgh, on the south shore of the
                        Firth of Forth, which provides a port for the city.</note> &amp; the river which the Scotch boast of so loudly – is nothing to
                    one who has seen Lisbon. I did not even think it of the second best order. But that from Princes Street<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> One of the main thoroughfares of central Edinburgh.</note> is truly surprizing. You cross a valley (once a
                    Loch) by a high bridge &amp; the back of the old city appears on the edge of this depth so vast – so irregular – with such an
                    outline of roofs &amp; chimneys that it looks like the ruins of a Giants palace. I never saw any thing so impressive as the first
                    sight of this. – there was a wild red sunset slanting along it.</p><p rend="indent1"> Of Edinburgh society I think very little. <ref target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</ref> very justly observed

                        alerted to ‘an old MSS volume of poems’ by Robert Hurrell Froude (1770/71–1859; <title>DNB</title>), a Church of England
                        clergyman, who was later Archdeacon of Totnes. The volume contained the text of three rare medieval metrical romances:
                            <title>Sir Isumbras, Sir Gowther</title>, and <title>Amadas</title> (or <title>Sir Amadace</title>). It had been owned by
                        the Sherbrooke family of Oxton, Nottinghamshire since the sixteenth century. Southey arranged for its purchase, through the
                        good offices of Scott, by Scott’s friend Thomas Thomson (1768–1852; <title>DNB</title>), the Edinburgh advocate, record keeper
                        and editor of medieval manuscripts. See letter 1147 of this edition. From Thomson the manuscript went to the Advocates
                        Library, Edinburgh. It remains in their collection today (National Library of Scotland, Advocates MS 19.3.1).</note> Were

                        medieval literature. One was his edition <title>Ancient English Metrical Romanceës</title>; the other was <title>Bibliographia

                        Southey now wished to fill the gap made by the removal of the ‘Vision’ in the new 1806 edition of <title>Poems</title> that he
                        was preparing for the press. He filled it with ‘The Retrospect’, originally published in <title>Poems</title> (1795) but did
                        not include ‘Rosamund to Henry, Written after She Had Taken the Veil’, also originally published in <title>Poems</title>
                        (1795). Other poems brought into the 1806 edition to make up for the removal of the ‘Vision’ were, ‘Translation of a Greek Ode on Astronomy, written for the prize at Cambridge, 1793’ (pp.  3–9); ‘Remembrance’ (pp. 40–43); ‘To Recovery’ (pp. 49–51); ‘Youth and Age’ (pp. 52–53); ‘The Traveller’s Return’ (pp. 54–55); ‘Autumn’ (pp. 56–58); ‘The Destruction of Jerusalem’ (pp. 59–62); ‘The Spanish Armada’ (pp. 63–66); ‘St Bartholomew’s Day’ (pp. 67–69); ‘To a Bee’ (pp. 74–75); ‘Metrical Letter’, pp. 76–79.
