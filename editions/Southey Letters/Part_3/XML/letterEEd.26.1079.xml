                    kept them unpublished till this time. <note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The third edition of Southey’s <title>Letters

                    till I have been once more to Portugal, &amp; then melt down the former volume &amp; make a good book. Perhaps you may make the

                    notice, – the sooner you make your appearance the better. not on account of season, for till Xmas all will be in the best order, –
                    but because it is always foolish to lose time – delays are dangerous in making a visit, as well as in making love.</p><p rend="indent1"> Madoc flourishes, – more than I had expected. it is a good poem, &amp; on its present plan could not have been
                    better, still I feel in myself powers which could have produced a better.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Madoc</title> was published in 1805.</note> Madoc himself is of too philosophic a character to be quite fit for poetry,
                    – he may be admired &amp; loved, – but cannot be sympathized with, because he is never in that state of feeling &amp; passion
                    which excites sympathy. Here is the advantage which Thalaba possesses.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey’s poem
                            <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801).</note> amid all that bustle of incident – that pantomimic change of scenery –
                    that world of wonders – Thalaba is for ever present, the single figure to whom every thing relates, at first the object of
                    curiosity, then of hope, lastly of pity. The two poems are not subjects of comparisons, but it is possible to give these
                    advantages to the hero of a poem as dramatically true in its structure as Madoc, &amp; this I have done. – I want you here,
                    because I want to talk over a story which seems as if it would come to something. that of Pelayo the restorer or founder of the
                    Spanish monarchy. I want to talk it over, &amp; to decide whether that or the Deluge be the better subject for a poem to be
                    pitched in a higher key than Madoc.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> The story of ‘Pelayo’ would become the subject-matter
                        of Southey’s poem <title>Roderick, The Last of the Goths</title> published by <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> in 1814. Southey did not write an epic on the Deluge (i.e., the Biblical Flood).</note> Oh Senhora if I
                    were but rich enough to write nothing but what I liked what a set of poems would I leave behind me! – I almost think that after
                    this present year I shall give over reviewing altogether, &amp; try whether the world will oblige me so much as to buy such a poem
                    as Thalaba once in eighteen months, which, if they would do it, would supersede the necessity. A years reviewing certainly does
                    not occupy so much thought, but it nearly employs as much time as such a poem would do.</p><p rend="indent1"> I should have sent this off some days ago had not some visitors interrupted me. Among the tribe came a certain Mr
