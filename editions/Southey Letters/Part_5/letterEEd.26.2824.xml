It will be unfortunate if chance should not one day bring me within reach of you; but I would rather that
               chance should bring you to Cumberland, when you can spare a few weeks for such a visit.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Townshend visited Southey in Keswick in October 1818; see Robert Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 26 October 1818, Letter
                  3203.</note> You will find a bed, plain fare, and a glad welcome; books for wet weather, a boat for sunny evenings; the loveliest
               parts of this lovely county within reach and within sight; and myself one of the best guides to all the recesses of the vales and
               mountains. As a geologist, you will enjoy one more pleasure than I do, who am ignorant of every branch of science. Mineralogy and
               botany are the only branches which I wish that I had possessed, not from any predilection for either, but because opportunities have
               fallen in my way for making observations (had I been master of the requisite knowledge) by which others might have been interested and
               guided. These two are sciences which add to our out-door enjoyments, and have no injurious effects. Chemical and physical studies seem,
               on the contrary, to draw on very prejudicial consequences. Their utility is not to be doubted; but it appears as if man could not
               devote himself to these pursuits without blunting his finer faculties.</p><p rend="indent1"> This county is very imperfectly visited by many of its numerous guests. They take the regular route, stop at the
               regular stations, ascend one of the mountains, and then fancy they have seen the Lakes, in which, after a thirteen years’ residence, I
               am every year discovering new scenes of beauty. Here I shall probably pass the remainder of my days. <ref type="m" target="places.html#CrosthwaiteChurch">Our church</ref>, as you may perhaps recollect, stands at a distance from the town,
               unconnected with any other buildings, and so as to form a striking and beautiful feature in the vale. The churchyard is as open to the
               eye and to the breath of heaven as if it were a Druid’s place of meeting. There I shall take up my last abode, and it is some
               satisfaction to think so – to feel as if I were at anchor, and should shift my berth no more.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey, his first wife Edith, and many members of their family are buried in the churchyard of St Kentigern’s, Crosthwaite.</note>
               A man whose habitual frame of mind leads him to look forward, is not the worse for treading the churchyard path, with a belief that
               along that very path his hearse is one day to convey him.</p><p rend="indent1"> Do not imagine that I am of a gloomy temper, – far from it; never was man blessed with a more elastic spirit or more
               cheerful mind; and even now the liquor retains its body and its strength, though it will sparkle no more.</p><p rend="indent1"> Your comments upon the Castle of Indolence express the feeling of every true poet; the second part must always be felt
               as injuring the first.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">James Thomson (1700–1748; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Castle of
                     Indolence</title> (1748).</note> I agree with you, also, as respecting the Minstrel, beautiful and delightful as it is. It still
               wants that imaginative charm which Thomson has caught from Spenser, but which no poet has ever so entirely possessed as Spenser
                  himself.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">James Beattie (1735–1803; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Minstrel</title>
                  (1771–1774). Like Thomson’s <title>Castle of Indolence</title>, it was indebted to Edmund Spenser (1552?–1599;
                  <title>DNB</title>).</note> Among the many plans of my ambitious boyhood, the favourite one was that of completing the Faery
                  Queen.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Spenser’s <title>The Faerie Queene</title> (1590–1596), a particular influence on
                  Southey, both as a young writer and on the works he produced as Poet Laureate. As a youth, Southey had planned a six–book
                  continuation but abandoned the idea after writing three cantos, which he destroyed; see Southey to William Taylor, 12 March 1799,
                     <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Two</title>, Letter 387.</note> For this purpose I had collected every hint
               and indication of what Spenser meant to introduce in the progress of his poem, and had planned the remaining legends in a manner which,
               as far as I can remember after a lapse of four or five-and-twenty years, was not without some merit. What I have done as a poet falls
               far short of what I had hoped to do; but in boyhood and in youth I dreamt of poetry alone; and I suppose it is the course of nature,
               that the ardour which this pursuit requires should diminish as we advance in life. In youth we delight in strong emotions, to be
               agitated and inflamed with hope, and to weep at tragedy. In maturer life we have no tears to spare; it is more delightful to have our
               judgment exercised than our feelings.</p><closer><salute rend="indent1"> God bless you! Come and visit me when you can. I long to see you.</salute><signed rend="indent2"> R.S.</signed></closer></div></body></text></TEI>
