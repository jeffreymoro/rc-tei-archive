                  publication of his juvenile Jacobin play, <title>Wat Tyler</title>, and William
                  Smith’s denunciation of Southey in the House of Commons on 14 March 1817 in the
                  debate on the Seditious Meetings Bill, where he condemned ‘the settled, determined
                  malignity of a renegado’ and compared Southey’s arguments against radical views in
                  the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 16 (October 1816), 227, with those expressed
                  in <title>Wat Tyler</title> (1817), Act 2, lines 103–112. The letters to Wynn
                  contained two letters for publication: to William Smith, 17 March 1817; and to the
                  Editor of the <title>Courier</title> [19 March 1817] (Letters 2943 and 2946).
                  These did not appear, but formed the basis of the pamphlet, <title>A Letter to
                     William Smith, Esq., M.P.</title> (1817).</note> They are of course materially

                     <title>DNB</title>), classical scholar and Master of Trinity College,
                  Cambridge. Richard Cumberland (1732–1811; <title>DNB</title>) had reported that
                  when a schoolmaster had promised to make Cumberland as learned as his grandfather,
                  Richard Bentley, the latter had exclaimed to the schoolmaster: ‘Pshaw, Arthur, how

               proof arrives, – in deference to your feeling. It does not offend my own cool
               judgement, – nor did I ever see it adduced as a proof of arrogance in Bentley, but

                  Johnson’s charge that the <title>Fragments of Ancient Poetry</title> (1760) was a
                  forgery, rather than a translation from Gaelic. Johnson’s letter began ‘I received

                  1817 (he had). However, any reference to duelling was removed from the pamphlet;
