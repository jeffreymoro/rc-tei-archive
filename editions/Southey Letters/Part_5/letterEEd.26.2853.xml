                  sight.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Having received much financial assistance from May over many years, Southey was now in
                  a position to begin repaying his debts.</note> The last twelvemonths have proved highly advantageous to my monied concerns, &amp;
               for the first time <del>in x</del> have made the balance of his account in my favour. There is good reason for hoping that it will
               continue so, &amp; that it will not be long before I shall be able to clear off my debt with you. Roderick<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814) was Southey’s most popular epic poem and went through three
                  editions in 1814–1815; a fourth edition appeared in 1816.</note> has produced for me above five hundred pounds, by three editions, –
               &amp; the fourth will by this time have paid its expences. Of the Pilgrimage<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Poet’s
                     Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816).</note> 2000 were printed; – they were all sold in the course of two months, leaving me a
               profit of 215£. My account only comes up to Midsummer, &amp; therefore does not include the Carmen Nuptiale, <del>with</del> of the
               fate of which I know nothing, – nor indeed what number was printed.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Lay of the
                     Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</title> (1816) sold slowly by comparison with <title>The Poet’s Pilgrimage</title> of the same year.
                  Longman charged four shillings for it and had 141 copies still unsold in 1821. </note></p><p rend="indent1"> The prospect before me is very good. The produce of my current publications may be reckond at 200£ a year certainly, –
               not improbably at twice the sum. And <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> pays me so well for the Quarterly that
               I hope there will be no occasion to draw much upon this other fund for my household expences. For some subjects he offers me 100£ per
               article, – such was that upon the poor in the last number,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s review article ‘On the
                  Poor’ appeared in the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 15 (April 1816), 187–235.</note> &amp; one upon foreign travellers in England
               which is designed for this, &amp; which I am busy in compleating.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s review article
                  ‘Works on England’ appeared in the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 15 (October 1816), 537–574.</note> I have no debt but the one to
               you, &amp; this I have great hopes of liquidating in the course of another year. For the next year is likely to be a productive one.
               The preface to Mort Arthur<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Byrth, Lyf, and Actes of Kyng Arthur</title> was published in two volumes by Longman
                  in 1817.</note> (for which I am reading much black letter, at some cost of eye sight, &amp; no little expence of time) will give me
               200£, – &amp; the second vol. of Brazil<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>History of Brazil </title>(1810–1819);
                  750 copies of the second volume were published in 1817. However, the 750 copies of the first volume, published in 1810, had still
                  not sold out and Southey had made less than £100 from the book.</note> about half as much, – <del>so preposterously an</del> a
               preposterous instance of the caprice upon which a man of letters depends for his remuneration! Perhaps the average may be fair at last,
               – but it is injurious as well as ridiculous <del>to</del> {that I should} derive my main support from what other persons might do as
               well, &amp; what might as well not be done at all, – while for works of permanent value, &amp; great labour, for which peculiar
               knowledge, peculiar talents &amp; peculiar industry are required the profit which I <del>derive</del> {obtain} would scarcely exceed,
               &amp; perhaps not amount to, the <del>price cost</del> expences of the documents. This volume will certainly be published at Christmas,
               &amp; tho it will be less interesting than the concluding volume I think you will not be disappointed in its contents. There will be no
               delay with the conclusion,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Chapter 30, <title>History of Brazil</title>, 3 vols (London,
                  1810–1819), II, pp. 632–692.</note> – I shall never lay it aside till it is compleated, – &amp; the printing will be pursued without
               interruption. – I have written no verses till this week when I resumed the Tale of Paraguay which I may perhaps finish for publication
               in the spring.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>A Tale of Paraguay</title> (1825).</note> There is another subject nearer
               my heart, but I must refrain from it a while longer.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey began, but did not finish, such a

                  (London, 1850), p. 815.</note> It has pleased God to support me mercifully under the severest of all privations, &amp; it would be
               sinful as well as in the last degree unwise, were I by any means to foster feelings which it is my duty, as far as possible to
               overcome.</p><p rend="indent1"> The summer (if summer it may be called) has brought with it more interruptions than usual, &amp; unavoidably robbed me
               of precious time which I could ill afford. I am in consequence behind hand with many things, – of which my long silence towards you is
               one proof. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walpoles memoir I shall resume upon the first interval; – it is upon my conscience, as the heaviest

Indeed, she had died on 17 October 1816, the

                  October 1816. She was John May’s favourite aunt and left him the residue of her estate, including her house at 4 Tavistock Street in
