               </ref>wrote to me to submit samples of his poetry &amp; ask my advice respecting his
               pursuits in life. In consequence of that advice &amp; of my interference he was
               placed as a <del>xxx</del> sizer at Emanuel;<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> A student in receipt of benefits such as free meals or lower fees, in return

               there, – &amp; nothing more promising than his talents; when the fever of last year
               put an end to all. His papers have been sent me; &amp; it is most probable that I
               shall publish a selection from him. This letter is to his father<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> James Du Sautoy (1761–1859), who had retired from
                  his post as a Lieutenant in the Royal Marines in 1798. Southey’s enclosure does
                  not survive. Southey did not publish a collection of Dusautoy’s poems.</note> upon
               the subject.</p><p rend="indent1"> I read <ref type="m" target="people.html#GrenvilleLord">Lord Grenvilles</ref> speech at the
               opening of the session with great pleasure, agreeing with him entirely in all
                  points.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Grenville had spoken in the
                  House of Lords on 19 February 1816; the main focus of his speech was to oppose the
                  size of the Army that the government proposed to maintain in peacetime.</note> The
               argument appears to me fallacious that because England has increased in power since
               the peace of Utrecht,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Treaty at
                  Utrecht (1713) concluded the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1713).</note>
               France ought to be left with all that Louis 14 added to her:<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> In the reign of Louis XIV (1638–1715; King of France
                  1643–1715), France expanded its territory, especially in Flanders, Alsace and the
                  border with Spain. Very few of these gains were given up in the Treaty of Paris
                  (1815).</note> England has increased in colonial power, – which is not available
               in European war, – indeed during war her foreign possessions divert a part of her
               strength. And as for any increase at home, France has kept pace with it,
                  <del>except</del> till the loss of population &amp; of maritime force during the
               last 25 years, – losses which a very few years of peace will repair.</p><p rend="indent1"> However the world has had a great example as well as a most aweful
               lesson. The example has been incompleat, &amp; the lesson is lost upon our <ref type="m" target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Broughams</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#Burdett">Burdetts</ref>, still I hope England &amp; the whole of Europe will be the
               better for both. I am taking a wide range in my poem,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Poet’s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title>
                  (1816).</note> &amp; venture upon high ground toward the close, touching the
               prospects of society. It has grown under my hands &amp; is not yet compleated, – so I
