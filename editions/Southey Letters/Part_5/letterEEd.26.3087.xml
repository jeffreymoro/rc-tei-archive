                  Grosvenor Charles to Bedford, 23 February 1818, Letter 3081. Southey’s intention was to gain information that might be used by
                  Brougham’s opponents in the forthcoming general election in Westmorland, where Brougham was standing against the chosen candidates
                  of Lord Lonsdale. The person who had asked for this information is unidentified. It might have been Wordsworth, who was an active
                  supporter, and client, of the Lowther family.</note> Do not however send off the number of the Satirist,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">‘Mr M’Kerrell and Mr Brougham’, <title>The Satirist; or, Monthly Meteor</title>, 11 (September 1812), 208–227. Robert
                  M’Kerrell (1761–1841), a textile merchant and manufacturer in Paisley, had on 28 May 1812, given evidence to the House of Commons
                  committee enquiring into the Orders in Council system, which enforced a trade blockade on territories controlled by France. The Whig
                  opposition were campaigning for its repeal, on the grounds that it harmed British manufacturing. Brougham denounced M’Kerrell
                  (though not by name) in the House of Commons on 16 June 1812, claiming he had told the committee that textile workers were overpaid
                  and ‘oatmeal and water were good enough for Englishmen.’ M’Kerrell denied he had said this and published an acrimonious exchange of
                  letters between himself and Brougham in <title>The Times</title> of 20 July 1812.</note> – because it is one thing to supply a man

                  not made clear how Indians in the Jesuit colonies, or Reductions, could cultivate their own land or acquire wealth when all property
                  was held in common.</note> – where no difficulty exists, – &amp; he conceives a general enmity between the Tupis &amp;

                  carried a number of extracts from Hamburg papers at the end of 1817, e.g. <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 8 December 1817. One of
                  the extracts reported that in the Kamchatka peninsula ‘in the course of last winter an incredible number of bears have left the
                  woods, frequently entered the houses of the Kamtschdales; in many places have attacked and devoured the inhabitants; nay traces have
                  even been found of their having killed and devoured each other; at the end of the winter many bears were found who had perished of
                  hunger. In several settlements they have killed from two to three hundred bears, the oldest Kamtschadales do not remember ever to
                  have seen so many bears so savage and blood-thirsty. The cause of this savageness and of their hunger is, that for these two years
                  past there has been an entire want of fish in the Kamschatka sea, and fish, as is well known, are the chief food of the bears, which
                  being usually so abundant in those waters, they easily contrive to catch. A couple of shocks of an earthquake have been lately felt
                  in the Peninsula.’</note> This I think some presumption that the disruption of the ice has been occasioned by <del>xxx</del>
               earthquakes <del>xx</del> {connected with} volcanic <del>convulsions</del> eruptions, – which I believe when they occur in the sea have
