                     Brazil</title> (1810–1819), Southey drew on a work of advice and warning to
                  government written by Antonio Vieira (1608–1697), <title>Papel Forte</title>
                  (1648) – literally ‘strong memorial’.</note> for his forthcoming number.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s article ‘Parliamentary Reform’,

               find your text there broadly stated, &amp; stoutly maintained.</p><p rend="indent1"> It seems the notion which the <del>xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxx</del> men in
               power had got in their noddles (heads I shall not call them) – was that I might be
               prevailed upon to conduct a political journal for them. I guessed as much, – seeing
               no other possible reason why they should wish to talk with me. This proposal I
               suppose has been so properly entertained by <ref type="m" target="people.html#HerriesJohnCharles">Herries</ref> –
               that it has <del>t</del> not been communicated to me in any way that requires an
               answer. Fools not to perceive that I am doing them ten times the service already,
               that it would be possible for me to do, by degrading myself in the manner that they
               propose.</p><p rend="indent1"> There are some hard blows in my Papal Forte, &amp; a direct call upon
               Ministers to check the license of the press. The personalities I shall leave in the
               Review, for which alone they were written, as being in time &amp; in place. The book
               I would fain make of permanent value, as well as of immediate utility.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was planning a book on the ‘State of the
                  Nation’, of which his <title>Quarterly Review</title> article would be the first
                  part.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> I thought to have comprized Brazil in two volumes, – the second vol.
               however exceeds the first in bulk, &amp; there is quite sufficient matter for a third
               upon the same scale.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Volume one of the

               The second is on the whole more amusing than the first. It is a history, from the
