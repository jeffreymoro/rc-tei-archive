               your packet arrived we were suffering under the severest of all afflictions, – the
               loss of <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">our only son</ref>, &amp; that son one of the most hopeful in every respect that ever parents
               were blest with.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Hebert Southey died on 17
                  April 1816.</note> Under such a sorrow it is only a firm, a lively &amp; an
               abiding faith which could support us. </p><p rend="indent1"> I wish it were in my power to render any service to your friend M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Steele,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Sarah
                  Steele, née Manly (dates unknown), wife of Lawrence-St George Steele of Rathbride
                  (dates unknown), published the poem Southey criticises here, at her own expense:
                     <title>Eva: an Historical Poem, with Notes, Accompanied by Some Lyric
                     Poems</title> (Dublin, 1816). Sarah Steele was, like the Lovells, from a Quaker
                  family, the Manlys of Tullamore.</note> or to offer her any useful advice. She
               certainly possesses great genius, &amp; many parts of her poem are very beautiful
               both in feeling &amp; expression; – I would not say this unless I thought so. But
               London booksellers are not fond of publishing poetry unless it comes from some known
               name, for otherwise not one volume in fifty pays the expense of publication. </p><p rend="indent1"> Eva is defective in story. The best way, as it appears to me in which
               your friend<del>s</del> could exercise &amp; improve her talents, is by taking some
               story from Romance, Eastern or Fairy Tales, &amp; clothing it in verse: – great poets
               have not disdained to do this. In this way I feel confident that with her powers she
               would <del>attain</del> distinguish herself greatly, &amp; the habits of narrative
               invention &amp; arrangement would gradually be acquired. It would be doing injustice
               to my own feelings if I did not repeat that this present volume bears the best marks
               of promise, – &amp; that every person to whom I have shown it has admired it very
               much. </p><p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerMary">Mary</ref> is a sad invalid, –
               the greater part of her time is past in a state of suffering from complaints which in
               no degree endanger life, – but deprive it of almost all enjoyment. There are however
               intervals when it appears as if she ailed nothing. <ref type="m" target="people.html#LovellRobertJr">Robert</ref> is still with <ref type="m" target="people.html#PopleWilliam">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Pople</ref>, his

               of some months standing, – which is now giving way. </p><p rend="indent1"> For ourselves till this late affliction (the heaviest which could
               possibly have befallen us) no persons were more abundantly blessed. And we have still
               more blessings than falls to the lot of the greater part of mankind, – tho the flower
               of our hopes &amp; happiness is cut off. We are both beginning to show the hand of
               time, – my own head is thickly sprinkled with grey hairs, – but the last two months
               have done more toward depriving me of a youthful hilarity of spirits, – than the
               course of years perhaps would ever have accomplished. We have four girls, <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">the eldest</ref>
