                        thought was preserved in his pupil, Lucius Flavius

                    &amp; the key of the Hampshire lock was in Bristol, &amp; I
                    heard all this at Falmouth. – but I can no doubt procure you
                    here some monks book in praise of celibacy, from which you
                    may learn that because there are no marriages in heaven,
                    there ought to be none on earth or you may read Origen<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Origen (185–254),
                        early Christian theologian and ascetic. He was believed
                        to have castrated himself.</note> who no doubt must have
                    considered the subject attentively. – or you may go &amp;
                    take your tea at Stockwell, &amp; damn Epictetus &amp;
                    Origen &amp; me &amp; the monks all together. </p>
<p rend="indent1"> Who were the father &amp; mother of Love is
                        <del rend="strikethrough">an</del> a point of
                    genemythology undetermined. he was probably hatched in the
                    great mundane egg – which by the by accounts for his wings –
                    &amp; that egg was probably a ducks egg, for his pinions are
                    mightily like a flappers. what would have happened if
                    Ahriman – (the Persians write him Ahriman,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Ahriman: Written upside
                        down. The destructive spirit in Zoroastrian
                        theology.</note> always upside down) – what would have
                    happened I say if this Evil Spirit had poached that egg it
                    would require a new Apocalypse to explain but &lt;in that
                    case&gt; you would not be <del rend="strikethrough">xxxx</del> going to tea at Stockwell. leaving then the
                    parentage of Love unsettled, the parish registers being very
                    defective upon this subject, &amp; there being nothing about
                    him in the book of Genesis, all I can discover of his
                    infancy is that Idleness <del rend="strikethrough">was</del>
                    &lt;is&gt; his nurse. Mathesis<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Learning, especially mathematics.</note>
                    would <del rend="strikethrough">kill</del> starve him by dry
                    nursing – &amp; Chemistry would certainly kill him in
                    experimenting. Poetry indeed is an excellent nurse, for she
                    makes a pet &amp; a plaything of him.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Love certainly infects by inoculation. in
                    blind people indeed it may be caught by contact like the
                    itch. but starving which is the preparatory for the small
                    pox, serves as a preventative against the other disease – a
                    Catholic Lent would be a fair dose. in one respect it
                    resembles the rheumatism – that of never being <del rend="strikethrough">xxx</del> acute &amp; chronic at
                    the same time.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Now in what mood will this find you? in rain
                    or in sunshine? in the hot or the cold ague fit? I am
                    writing it in a wet day – &amp; – our Lady forgive me! with
                    the history of our Lady of Guadalupe<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The monastery at Guadalupe in Spain
                        contained a 12th-century statue of the Virgin Mary (‘our

                        apparitions.</note> lying under my elbow. in any mood

                    &amp; disappointment for I had intended to have crossed the
                    water &amp; told him of his English friends. four years have
                    altered Lisbon &amp; the little world in which I moved.
                    deaths &amp; removals – where is one? dead! another? in
                    England! a third? at Madrid. a fourth? God knows where.
                    &amp; the momentary feeling passes away like an electric
                    shock – sudden &amp; transitory! so we feel for our
                    acquaintances – so others in their turn will feel for us.
                    the place of every one is soon supplied, as one plant grows
                    in the place of another. our very feelings change also. do
                    you know Spensers Cantos of Mutability?<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Edmund Spenser (1552–1599;

                        book of the <title>Faerie Queene</title>
                        (1590–1596).</note> they are such as only Spenser, whose
                    name I write with the reverence of idolatrous love, <del rend="strikethrough">x</del> could have written. </p>
<p rend="indent1"> We are still busy in the ceremonials of first
                    visits, &amp; a week must yet pass before I feel full
                    leisure. I rise early &amp; take my siesta after dinner.
                    letter writing has been a serious employment since my
                    arrival &amp; has almost monopolized my time, so many
                    persons are there who expect to hear of me &amp; who would
                    interpret silence into neglect or unkindness. I have yet
                    hardly half done this task work which keeps me from more
                    important employments. A summer here will be new to me,
                    &amp; the grand Corpus Christi procession &amp; the Bull
                    fights. <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref>
                    has every thing to see &amp; as you may suppose is highly
                    amused by the strangeness of every thing. Our servants
                    understand no English – she no Portugueze – so I am
                    interpreter – but enough for these purposes is soon &amp;
                    inevitably acquired, for my part instead of losing my
                    knowledge in England, I am far better acquainted with the
                    language than when I left the country. reading has done this
                    for me. &amp; I now gain ground every day.</p>
