<p rend="indent1"> We shall be very glad to see you my dear
                    Grosvenor if you can come. there is a bed in the house &amp;
                    I am of necessity an idle man – &amp; can show you all
                    things worth seeing – &amp; get you a dose of the beatifying
                        gas<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Nitrous
                        oxide, or ‘laughing gas’.</note> which is a pleasure
                    worth the labour of a longer journey. </p>
<p rend="indent1"> I have written to <ref target="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppa</ref>, &amp;
                    asked him some questions about Italy. Florence or Leghorn
                    are certainly safe. &amp; for the inconvenience of
                    travelling I have the advantage of experience, &amp; know
                    how best to obviate them. go I must. it is recommended –
                    &amp; tho my malady is not <hi rend="ital">imaginaire</hi>,
                    yet is imagination the cure for it: employment prevents it –
                    it is a disease of association &amp; no way so likely to
                    break the chain as by precipitating myself into a scene
                    where every thing is new.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Myself I have often thought of the Chancery
                        line<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was
                        discussing whether to concentrate a future legal career
                        on civil cases heard in the Court of Chancery.</note> –
                    &amp; for the reasons you have alledged. <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> did not
                    seem to like it. he is ambitious for me – &amp; perhaps
                    hardly understand how utterly I am without that stimulus. I
                    shall write to him a serious letter about it. Do not suppose
                    that I feel burthened or uneasy – all I feel is that were I
                    possessed of the same income in an<del rend="strikethrough">y</del>other way – I would never stir a finger to
                    increase it in a way to which self gratification was not the
                    immediate motive instead of self-interest. it is enough for
                    all my wants, &amp; just leaves motive enough not to be idle
                    that I may have to spare for my relations. this Grosvenor I
                    do feel. practically I know my own wants, &amp; can
                    therefore speculate upon them securely.</p>

                    was a strange man – I should like to see his papers. an
                    infidel in his time was a rare character – &amp; he united
                    enthusiasm with infidelity, loving God too much &amp;
                    revering him too much to believe in common Christianity.</p>

                        Surrey, near the Bedfords. In 1789 he married as his

                    disagreable – a witholding herself while she draws out you;
                    there is feeling in her face &amp; manners, but no openness.
                    the Quakers are to me an unpleasant sect. they are made up
                    of appearances, &amp; uniformly have I found them

                    get into deep waters. besides he is a man of no consistent
                    views, &amp; perhaps of no consistent feelings. Grosvenor I

                    feel neither much affection nor much esteem – but his
                    company always gives me pleasure, &amp; he certainly is not
                    made of common clay. Perhaps the closest friendships will be
                    found among men of inferior intellect, for such can most
                    compleatly accord with each other. there is scarcely any man
                    with whom the whole of my being comes in contact, &amp; this
