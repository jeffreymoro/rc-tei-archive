<p rend="indent1"> Shewing how an old Woman rode double &amp;
                    who rode before her.</p>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> The Raven croakd as she sate at her
                        meal.</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And the old woman knew what he said,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And she grew pale at the Ravens tale,</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And sickend &amp; went to her bed.</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> Now fetch me my children &amp; fetch them
                        with speed</l>
<l rend="indent4"> The old woman of Berkely said,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> The monk my son &amp; my daughter the
                        nun,</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Bid them hasten or I shall be dead.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> The monk her son &amp; her daughter the
                        nun</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Their way to Berkely bent,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And they have brought with pious
                        thought</l>
<l rend="indent4"> The holy sacrament.</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> The old woman shriekd as they enterd her
                        door,</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Twas fearful her shrieks to hear,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Now take the sacrament away!</l>
<l rend="indent4"> For mercy, my children dear.</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> Her lip it trembled with agony</l>
<l rend="indent4"> The sweat ran down her brow,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> I have tortures in store for
                        evermore,</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Oh spare me my children now.</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> Away they sent the sacrament,</l>
<l rend="indent4"> The fit it left her weak,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> She lookd at her children with gastly
                        eyes</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And faintly struggled to speak.</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> All kind of sin have I rioted in</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And the judgement now must be,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> But I securd my childrens souls –</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Oh pray my children for me.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> I have suckd the breath of sleeping
                        babes,</l>

<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> And let me be chaind in my coffin of

<l rend="indent3"> With iron bars. &amp; let it be

<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> And bless the chains &amp; sprinkle

<l rend="indent4"> And let fifty priests stand round,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Who night &amp; day the mass may say</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Where I lie on the ground.</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> And let fifty choristers be there</l>
<l rend="indent4"> The funeral dirge to sing,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Who day &amp; night by the tapers
                        light</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Their aid to me may bring.</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> And let the church bells all both great
                        &amp; small</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Be tolld by night &amp; day</l>
<l rend="indent3"> To drive from hence the fiends who

<l rend="indent4"> To bear my corpse away.</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> And ever have the church door barrd</l>
<l rend="indent4"> After the even song,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And I beseech you children dear</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Let the bars &amp; bolts be strong.</l>
</lg>

<l rend="indent4"> My wretched corpse to save;</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Preserve me so long from the fiendish
                        throng</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And then I may rest in my grave.</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> The old woman of Berkeley laid her
                        down</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And her eyes grew deadly dim,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Short came her breath &amp; the struggle
                        of death</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Distorted every limb.</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> They blest the old womans

<l rend="indent4"> With rites &amp; prayers due,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> With holy water they sprinkled her

<l rend="indent4"> And they sprinkled her coffin too.</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> And they chaind her in her coffin of
                        stone</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And with iron bard it down, </l>
<l rend="indent3"> And in the church with three strong

<l rend="indent4"> They chaind it to the ground.</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> And they blest the chains &amp; sprinkled

<l rend="indent3"> By night &amp; day the mass to say</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Where she lay on the ground.</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> And fifty choristers were there</l>
<l rend="indent4"> To sing the funeral song.</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And a hallowed taper blazed in the
                        hand</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Of all &lt;the&gt; sacred throng.</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> To see the priests &amp; choristers </l>
<l rend="indent4"> It was a goodly sight</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Each holding, as it were a staff,</l>
<l rend="indent4"> A taper burning bright.</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> And the church &lt;bells&gt; all both
                        great &amp; small</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Did toll so loud &amp; long,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And they have barrd the church door
                        firm</l>
<l rend="indent4"> After the even song.</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> And the first night the tapers light</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Burnt steadily &amp; clear,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> But they without a hideous rout</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Of angry fiends could hear;</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> A hideous roar at the church door</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Like a long thunder peal,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And the priests they prayd &amp; the
                        choristers sung</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Louder in fearful zeal:</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> Loud tolld the bell, the priests prayd
                        well</l>
<l rend="indent4"> The tapers they burnt bright</l>
<l rend="indent3"> The monk her son &amp; her daughter the
                        nun</l>
<l rend="indent4"> They told their beads all night.</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> The cock he crew away they flew</l>
<l rend="indent4"> The fiends from the herald of day</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And undisturbd the choristers sing </l>
<l rend="indent4"> And the fifty priests they pray.</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> The second night the tapers light</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Burnt dismally &amp; blue</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And every one saw his neighbours face</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Like a dead mans to view.</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> And yells &amp; cries without arise</l>
<l rend="indent4"> That the stoutest heart might shock</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And a deafening roaring like a cataract
                        pouring</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Over a mountain rock.</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> The monk &amp; nun they told their
                        beads</l>
<l rend="indent4"> As fast as they could tell</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And aye as louder grew the noise</l>
<l rend="indent4"> The faster went the bell.</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> Louder &amp; louder the choristers
                        sung</l>
<l rend="indent4"> As they trembled more &amp; more,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And the fifty &lt;priests&gt; prayed to
                        heaven for aid</l>
<l rend="indent4"> They never had prayed so before.</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> The cock he crew, away they flew</l>
<l rend="indent4"> The fiends from the herald of day</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And undisturbd the choristers sing</l>
<l rend="indent4"> And the fifty priests they pray.</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> The third night came &amp; the tapers
                        flame</l>
<l rend="indent4"> A hideous stench did make,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And blue they burnt as tho they had been
                        dipt</l>
<l rend="indent4"> In the burning brimstone lake.</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> And the loud commotion, like the rushing
                        of ocean</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Grew momently more &amp; more,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And strokes as of a battering ram</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Did shake the strong church door.</l>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent3"> The bell men they for very fear </l>
<l rend="indent4"> Could toll the bell no longer,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And still as louder grew the strokes</l>
<l rend="indent4"> Their terror grew the stronger.</l>
