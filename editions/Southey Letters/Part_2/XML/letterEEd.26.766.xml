                        which suggested that France could still re-conquer Egypt, was a major factor

                    France would take Egypt as soon as we left it. You were a clearer-sighted

                        after a series of slave revolts. A fleet and army were despatched in
                        December 1801 to re-conquer the colony. While Haiti was still under French
                        occupation at this time, the French army was being worn down by disease and
                        further revolts that broke out in October 1802.</note> business will have
                    been the cause, though not the pretext, and that rascal will set the poor
                    negroes cutting English throats instead of French ones. It is true, country is
                    of less consequence than colour there, and these black gentlemen cannot be very
                    wrong if the throat be a white one; but it would be vexatious if the followers

                        France in 1802 and died 7 April 1803.</note> should be made the tools of
                    Bonaparte. </p>
<p rend="indent1"> Meantime, what becomes of your scheme of travelling? If France
                    goes to war, Spain must do the same, even if the loss of Trinidad<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> In the Treaty of Amiens (1802) Spain had been
                        required to cede Trinidad to Britain.</note> did not make them inclined to
                    it. You must not think of the Western Islands or the Canaries; they are prisons
                    from whence it is very difficult to escape, and where you would be cut off from
                    all regular intercourse with England: besides, the Canaries will be hostile
                    ports. In the West Indies you ought not to trust your complexion. When the tower
                    of Siloam fell, it did not give all honest people warning to stand from
                        under.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">
<title>Luke</title> 13: 4 ‘Or
                        those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye
                        that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?’</note> How is
                    the climate of Hungary? Your German would carry you there, and help you there
                    till you learnt a Slavonic language; and you might take home a profitable
                    account of a country and a people little known. If it should be too cold a
                    winter residence, you might pass the summer there, and reach Constantinople or
                    the better parts of Asia Minor in the winter. This looks like a tempting scheme
                    on paper, and will be more tempting if you look at the map; but, for all such
                    schemes, a companion is almost necessary. </p>

                    quite groundless towards a man who has left no relations or connections who
