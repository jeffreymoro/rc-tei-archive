                    great labour.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> It is a serious evil that no man of adequate

                    should the Metrical Romances &amp;c be edited. thus would
                    their funds be of public utility – now they are only
                    collected for the ostentation of patronage &amp; do no more
                    good than any common alms. I am fretted about your Welsh
