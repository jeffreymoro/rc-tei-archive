<p rend="indent1"> Thank God I am at home. in London I was
                    perpetually employed &amp; every day fatigued, yet doing
                    nothing. <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</ref> left town soon after you. perhaps you
                    know that he arrived to find his father dying.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">John Burnett (d. 1799), a
                        farmer at Huntspill, Somerset.</note> As soon as he can
                    with propriety leave home I expect him here. I am anxious to
                    know in what circumstances he is left. his father was
                    considered as a wealthy man, &amp; <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnetts</ref> share
                    ought to be enough to float him into his new profession. but
                    he had enemies at home; perhaps the poor old mans property
                    consisted chiefly in land &amp; he may have made no will
                        <del rend="strikethrough">x.</del> I daily expect to
                    hear of <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">George</ref>
                    or to see him. he loved his father – &amp; the suddenness of
                    his loss must have affected him much.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I thank you for the Noachide.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Johann Bodmer (1698–1783),
                            <title>Noachide</title> (1752). Southey thought it
                        was a ‘bad poem’; see <title>Common-Place Book</title>,
                        ed. John Wood Warter, 4 series (London, 1849–1850), IV,
                        p. 2, but based his planned poem on Noah and the Flood
                        on it (<title>Common-Place Book</title>, IV, pp.
                        2–3).</note> my grammar &amp; dictionary are now at
                    hand, &amp; give me a very dark-lanthorn sort of glimmer to
                    guide me. however patience &amp; curiosity will help me thro
                    the book. it is nine years since a schoolfellows account
                    made me desirous of reading it, &amp; luckily the
                    translation has never fallen in my way. the subject is
                    certainly a noble one, as you say the noblest the Xtian
                    system affords, or perhaps any system. if I had leisure my
                    scattered ideas upon it would soon mould into a plan. I
                    would take <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnetts</ref> philosophy<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Burnet (c. 1635–1715;
                            <title>DNB</title>), whose <title>Telluris Theoria
                            Sacra</title> (1681) had speculated about the early
                        history of the Earth before and after the Flood.</note>

                        writings relating to Jewish law, customs, ethics and
                        history.</note> interest enough might be excited <del rend="strikethrough">among</del> for some of the
                    sufferers. you are yet hesitating how to employ yourself.
                    does not this subject suit you? as for hexameters, to send
                    scattered parties of 20 or 50 or 100 is useless, they will
                    be cut off. but if we could march an army of five or six
                    thousands into the country, ably drawn up, they would
                    maintain their ground against all opposition.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Sir Iwayne<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Chretien de Troyes (12th century),
                            <title>Yvain, the Knight of the Lion</title>, was

                        prominent Knight at the Court of King Arthur.</note> is
                    a stranger to me. but I should be better pleased to hear you
                    were employed upon his story than in translating.
                    translating <del rend="strikethrough">in</del> should be
                    left to inferiour hands. the painter who can design should
                    not waste his labour in copying. The metrical romance ought
                    to be revived &amp; Arthurs court furnishes variety of
                    subject. I should like to see my prophecy of the Chiefs of
                        Carduel<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Carduel
                        was one of the sites of Arthur’s Court. Southey desired
                        that his contemporaries would make greater use of Arthur
                        and of medieval romance. He had probably discussed this
                        with Taylor when they met in London.</note>
                    accomplished; still more if it were fulfilled by you.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Lewis, the Monk man, is about to publish a

                        (1796). Southey contributed to his <title>Tales of

                    whom your translation had been attributed, so that instead
                    of yours he has hampered himself with a very inferiour

<p rend="indent1"> I am sorry you did not see the Milton

                        Milton (1608–1674; <title>DNB</title>).</note> Fuseli
                    raised no expectations in me, except of distortion &amp;
                    extravagance. there was something of this – but there was
                    also a sublimity of which I could scarcely have supposed
                    painting capable. he has doubled the pleasure I derive from
                    Milton. Fuseli has even corrected his author. in the
                    creation of Eve he has pictured a Demiourgos instead of the
                    Deity, the countenance <del rend="strikethrough">turned</del> fixed upon the divine presence
                    charactering the inferiour agent. the bridging the abyss;
                    the encounter of Satan &amp; Death are surpassingly fine.
                    the Lazar-house a tremendous picture. I judge of pictures
                    merely by the effect produced on me, without any knowledge
                    of painting. these delighted me for two hours &amp; I could
                    have sat there all the day.</p>

                    bear the date 1800. the printers have been waiting till this
