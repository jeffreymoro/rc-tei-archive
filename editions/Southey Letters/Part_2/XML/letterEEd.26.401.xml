                        Maber</ref> had apprized him. this was in 1796 – but in

                    wish to know where the boys are boarded &amp; the expence.

                    rather imagine that the foundation entirely supports the
                    boys. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">he</ref> was
                    eleven in December last. I am very desirous of removing him
                    while the faults of his education are remediable.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> The <del rend="strikethrough">character</del>
                    &lt;conduct&gt; of Judas Iscariot affords an argument
                    against Xtianity because he must have seen the moral
                    excellence &amp; the miraculous powers of Jesus, &amp; in
                    that case must have knowingly acted to his own damnation; a
                    madness seemingly impossible. to this the answer may be that
                    like his countrymen he might impute miracles to magic. Judas
                    was evidently predestined to his guilt; the doctrine of
                    universal restitution enables us to reconcile this to the
                    Goodness &amp; Justice of Deity – yet is it still a
                    difficulty.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Another objection to Xtianity is the prophecy
                    of Jesus which is explained to relate to the destruction of
                    Jerusalem tho its obvious meaning is the end of the
                        world.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
<title>Luke</title> 19: 41–44.</note>
</p>
<p rend="indent1"> The only other objection which has any weight
                    relates to the Jewish dispensation. the extermination of the
                    Canaanites &amp; the human sacrifice of Agag.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
<title>Deuteronomy</title>
                        20: 16–18; 1 <title>Samuel</title> 15: 32–33.</note> on
                    this subject I know too little to do any thing but doubt.
                    but it is possible for a Socinian to believe Xtianity &amp;
                    reject Judaism.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> We will talk of these subjects, &amp; as you
                    have the advantage of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Heys<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Possibly the Cambridge

                    we can have his opinion upon any question that puzzles us.
                    the objections have weight, but they are nothing in the
                    scale. there is no occasion to “throw the weight of hope
