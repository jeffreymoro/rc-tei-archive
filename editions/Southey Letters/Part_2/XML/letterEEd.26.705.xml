<p>To night I have been overhauling old papers – a business
                    which to me is truly detestable – old recollections rise as
                    if it were a rehearsal of Doomsday. old mirth that makes one
                    unhappy – &amp; letters from those who are dead! – a whole
                    heap are already piled for the candle – another I have
                    thrown aside as precious materials for</p>

<p>a publication which I hope may be long delayed – but such a
                    heap I shall lay by. I have received too many odd letters to
                    be all wasted.</p>

                    materially altered me. the flavour of the liquor is the same

<p>I wrote this morning to Wrexham before your letter came
                        &amp; inclosed the Dog story.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The ‘dog Story’ came from Gaspar
                            Pérez de Villagrá (1555-1620), who served as a
                            captain in the 1598 expedition that first colonised
                            New Mexico. His epic <title>Historia de la Nueva
                                México</title> (1610), Canto 19, lines 221-244,
                            described how he was forced to kill his dog for
                            food. However, he then found he was unable to eat
                            the animal. Southey’s letter containing the story
                            has not survived.</note>
