<p rend="center">–––––</p>
<p>
<date when="1800-09-23">Sept. 23.</date> Grosvenor, more than
                    a month has this letter lain unfinished in my desk – not
                    from laziness, but in the hope &amp; expectation that every
                    packet would bring me some tidings from you. soberly &amp;
                    seriously I am angry with you. </p>
<p rend="indent1"> Lately I have not been so well as for the
                    first months after my arrival: partly because the stimulus
                    of novelty has lost its power, – still more owing to
                    intelligence from England that <ref target="people.html#HillMargaret">a near relation</ref>
                    is dying in a consumption. – I feel the want of society here
                    – of the free &amp; unrestrained intercourse to which I have
                    been accustomed. the weather – the rumour of the day – the
                    tittle-tattle of the place – &amp; the politics of last
                    nights rubber, poorly compensate the topics afforded by
                    common principles, pursuits in common, or the recollection
                    of old times. <ref target="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</ref>
                    however amply makes amends for this privation. I often gaze
                    &amp; gaze till I forget myself &amp; lose all thought – all
                    recollection. You cannot imagine nor is it in my power to
                    describe the beauties of this place. there are no miniature
                    resemblances in England to assist me.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> We are in some apprehension &amp; some danger
                    of receiving the Pestilence from Cadiz. it is certainly at
                    Seville, where the average number of deaths are forty a day.
                    whether it be the Black Vomit, an epidemic disease which has
                    before ravaged this country, or the Yellow Fever from the
                    Havannah, or the Plague from Tetuan we are even now
                    uncertain – so different are the accounts. No precautions
                    are taken to secure us, nor can any avail. a Gallego<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">A native of Galicia in
                        north-west Spain.</note> was here at <ref target="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</ref> yesterday who
                    left Cadiz only 17 days ago, where he had lost his father by
                    the disease, from which he himself had recovered. he escaped
                    with ten others from Cadiz &amp; they are now all in Lisbon
                    unmolested. If the disease had been infectious it must have
                    broken out here. At Cadiz it abates – because its food is
                    exhausted &amp; the place nearly desolate – but this is poor
                    consolation since it has taken root at Seville. if it comes
                    nearer I may probably be driven to winter in England. but
                    our hope is that the rains &amp; the winter will destroy the
                    disease.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Of invasion &amp; war &amp; such trite evils
                    we now neither think or talk – this nearer <del rend="strikethrough">xxxt</del> danger which comes home
                    to every one monopolizes our attention. it is the news from
                    the South of Spain that we enquire, &amp; the number of
                    deaths, &amp; <hi rend="ital">where</hi> is the disorder
                    now. yet with all this evident &amp; imminent &amp;
                    acknowledged danger I do not perceive any person permanently
                    alarmed. the thought seems dropt with the conversation:
                    &amp; we propose schemes of retirement &amp; resources as a
                    matter of mirth – which perhaps tomorrow may render serious
                    &amp; necessary. </p>
<p rend="indent1"> In the course of next week we shall probably
                    remove to Lisbon. <ref target="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</ref> grows cold, &amp; I daily wish myself in
                    our sunny town apartments. from thence it is easy to reach
                    England in case of an attack – but we shall be guided by
                        <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my
                        Uncle</ref>, &amp; indeed my own wish is to remain &amp;
                    retire into the country if retirement be necessary – no
                    English fire, no English comfort, can compensate for your
                    rains &amp; your frosts &amp; your fogs. I feel them like a
                    green house plant, &amp; must live in the Sunshine. of
                    sunshine I have had my share – we had the Siroc incessantly
                    for almost three weeks – I <del rend="strikethrough">I</del>
                    sate without coat or waistcoat in a wet room, idle, &amp;
                    motionless – &amp; yet bathed with perspiration. this was
                    unusual weather &amp; uncomfortabell – but it did not affect
                    my health, &amp; in spirits I was never better. At Cadiz
                        the<del rend="strikethrough">se</del> Siroc blew for
                    nine weeks, &amp; to this some accounts impute the disorder
                    there. Of the heat occasioned by a hot wind you can form no
                    idea – I have felt sweltering days in England – but the
                    Siroc is the very breath of Beelzebub – only that I conceive
                    Beezlebubs breath smells of brimstone.</p>

                    But of all <del rend="strikethrough">old</del> obsolete
                    follies still retained here the most remarkable are the
                    Easter Dramas, the very Mysteries so long disused in England
                    &amp; in all civilized countries. this paper allows me not
                    room to sketch you an account of them – but in my next I
                    will give you ample &amp; ridiculous specimens. <ref target="people.html#Bedfordfamily">your father</ref> is
                    fond of dramatic history, &amp; they will amuse him. – From
                    the Moors this people have also caught much. a spell called
                    a figa is common to both. tis a clenched hand with the thumb
                    between two fingers, excellent against witchcraft – our
                    proverb a ‘fig for him’ is probably hence derived. like the
                    Mohammedans they do not fly from an infectious disease. Is
                    the small-pox next door? the mother will not remove her
                    children: no – if they <hi rend="ital">are</hi> to have it
                    it is no use to remove, if they are <hi rend="ital">not</hi>, they are safe where they are. – Fowl broth is the
                    panacea of Portugal, &amp; the idea is scarcely yet obsolete
                    that to render it efficacious it should be made of a cock,
                    whipped to death in the room with the patient. now they
                    think it good for nothing unless it be eaten on the same day
                    that the fowl was killed – the broth having more <hi rend="ital">life</hi> in it! – Nor is it a human remedy
                    only, – nothing is so good for a horse! since we have been
                    at <ref target="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</ref> this was
                    prescribed for a horse in the possession of our of our
                    acquaintance. he would not take it. will you believe me when
                    I assure you that the grooms <hi rend="ital">forced it down
                        his nostrils</hi>? <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref>
                    upon hearing it remonstrated with them upon the cruelty
                    &amp; folly – why Sir <del rend="strikethrough">how do</del>
                    it went into the stomach all the same. how do you think
                    people are drowned if the water does not get thro the nose
                    into the stomach? – the horse happily died, – here are no
                    hounds to eat the carcase – &amp; the Portugueze have a
                    Moorish or Jewish – or foolish antipathy to it. it was taken
                    out secretly &amp; in darkness &amp; buried: I verily
                    believe the Portugueze would rather &lt;have&gt; been seen
                    committing murder than at this <hi rend="ital">impure</hi>
                    employment. </p>
