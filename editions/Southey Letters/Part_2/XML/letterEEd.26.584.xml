                    concluding a peace. without generals – without money, food
                    or ammunition, Portugal has no alternative. all the Saints
                    have been called in. I saw a special procession on Sunday
                    last. The miraculous Image our Lord of the Sufferings is now
                    in the Cathedral where <del rend="strikethrough">the</del>
                    men &amp; women of rank set the example of first putting his
                    heel against each eye &amp; then kissing it. yesterday I
                    went to see this ceremony. no doubt is entertained here that
                    peace must be made by the expulsion of the English, still a
                    heavy calamity to the settlers, tho much of the property has
                    been removed. the prospect for the inhabitants is dismal.
                    Alentejo their corn-country is the seat of war &amp; famine
                    appears inevitable. the English families begin to move &amp;
                    some of the merchants are sending away their <del rend="strikethrough">fam</del> wives &amp; children,
                    that they may be the less embarrassed at last. I should like

                    characteristic. they ordered them all out of the Kingdom
                    within 15 days. this was sending from 30 – to 50,000 working
                    men – who knew the country – to the Spaniards who would
                    immediately form an army of them. they are the
                    water-carriers here – the porters – the servants – almost
                    exclusively. to supply their places Portugal must thin her
                    armies. they found out this &amp; fell upon all underhand
                    shifts to prevent the execution of their own order. first
                    they forbade all carriers to take any Gallegos baggage. then
                    they refused to grant them passports. at last they issued
                    another edict to make them stay.</p>
