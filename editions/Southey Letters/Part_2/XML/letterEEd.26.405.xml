<p rend="indent1"> Your letter my dear Edith reached me not till late last evening –
                    &amp; it could hardly have arrived more opportunely – for it was on my return
                    from a visit to a M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Boltby<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> here that I found it. we had dined

                    people all of whom were compleatly strange to me &amp; most of whom I hope &amp;
                    trust will remain so. there were some blockheads there one of whom chose to be
                    exposed by engaging in some classical &amp; historical disputes with me. another
                    gave as a toast General Suwarrow<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Alexander Vasilyevich Suvorov (1729–1800), Russian general. When his troops
                        conquered the fortesses of Ochakov (1788) and Izmail (1790) in the
                        Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792) the inhabitants were massacred. Similarly,
                        about 20,000 civilians were killed when his troops entered the Warsaw suburb
                        of Praga in December 1794. This action effectively ended Polish resistance
                        to the partition of the country. In 1799 he was leading Russian forces in a
                        successful campaign against French troops in northern Italy.</note> – the
                    man who massacred men women &amp; children for three successive days at Warsaw –
                    who slew at Ockzakow thirty thousand persons in cold blood – &amp; thirty
                    thousand at Ismael. I was so astonished at hearing this dæmons name as only to
                    repeat it in the tone of wonder, but before I had time to think or to reply <ref target="people.html#CarlisleAnthony">Carlisle</ref> turned to the man who
                    gave the toast &amp; said he would not drink General Suwarrow – &amp; off we

                    fellows would talk politics of which they knew nothing; I only said enough to

                    company. after five hours so put to the torture your letter was doubly welcome –

                    surprized to see how fat he is grown, &amp; how well he looks. as we went to
                    dinner yesterday a coachful of women drew up to the door at the moment we
                    arrived there. it rained merrily – &amp; he offered his umbrella, but the prim
                    gentry were somewhat rudely shy of <del rend="strikethrough">Carlisles</del> him
                    &amp; me too – for his hair was a little ragged &amp; I had not silk stockings
                    on. he made them ashamed of this at dinner. never did you see any thing so
                    hideous as their dresses. they were pink muslin with
                    white-pocket-handkerchief-round-little spots. waists down God knows how far –
                    &amp; <del rend="strikethrough">xx</del> buttoned from the neck down to the end
                    of the waist – with a bosom protuberance before as ugly as the old
                    fortifications – or merry thoughts – or what-dye callums that made the women
                    drink over the shoulders. I could have kickd them for their fool fashions.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Well Edith – here have I written you a letter full of nothing –
                    nor have I ought to say save the endless repetition that I am home sick – that I
                    want to be with you – &amp; often as this has been repeated I believe you are as
                    little weary of hearing as I am of repeating it. the news of the day is that
                    Buonaparte is doing wonders, &amp; the Pacha who wrote that letter to denounce
                    his vengeance on “Buonaparte, whom God curse.” as he said, has been by the Turks
                    own account “miserably defeated.”<note n="19" place="foot" resp="editors">Napoleon Bonaparte (1769–1821; First Consul, 1799–1804, Emperor of the

                        including an admission from the local Ottoman commander, Ahmed al-Jazzar
                        Pasha (1708/20–1804), who was in charge of the defence of Acre, that his

                    stated his under sixty pounds a year. They said they were not satisfied – &amp;
                    his reply begins by saying he has much more reason to be dissatisfied with the
                    smallness of his income than they have.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I look for another letter from you. there is pleasure in
