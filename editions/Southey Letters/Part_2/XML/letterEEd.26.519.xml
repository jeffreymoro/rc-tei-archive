<salute>My dear friend</salute>
</opener>
<p rend="indent1"> We had a fine passage of five &amp; a half
                    days, delightful weather &amp; light winds all the way. yet
                    we both suffered much, scarcely eating or sleeping the whole
                    of the way. On Thursday we left Falmouth, at five in the
                    evening, glad to escape. my feeling at quitting England was
                    not unpleasant, serious but not depressing. as we left the
                    harbour all the land objects seemed to rock like a dream.
                    one hour sickened me – I only rose the three following days
                    just to wash myself &amp; crawl on deck while John Moor<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">John Moor (dates
                        unknown), probably a sailor on the <hi rend="ital">King
                            George</hi> packet.</note> (a good old man)
                    freshened up my coffin like bed. A little circumstance which
                    I witnessed there struck me much. a hen had just laid an egg
                    &amp; was eating it. so totally the sea seemed to
                    denaturalize every thing. On Sunday a frigate chased us for
                    seventy miles. Monday I heard the Captain<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Bayntun Yescombe
                        (1765–1803), Captain of the Falmouth Packet, <hi rend="ital">King George.</hi>
</note> awakened by
                    Bell. there was a Cutter<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Fortunately, the ‘cutter’ turned out to
                        be the British frigate HMS <hi rend="ital">Endymion</hi>.</note> bearing down upon us. the Prince
                        Ernest<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The <hi rend="ital">Prince Ernest</hi> was another packet
                        ship, which sailed on the Falmouth to Lisbon
                        route.</note> was in company with us, she carried six
                    guns, the K. George ten. we made signals which the Cutter
                    did not answer. we fired a gun – she did the same, &amp;
                    preparations were made for action. <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> was
                    dreadfully terrified – I surrounded her with mattrasses in
                    the cabin, but she could not feel in safety there. I lodged
                    her in the cock pit, &amp; went on deck &amp; took my
                    station with a musquet. The Cutter bore down between us – I
                    saw the smoke from her matches. her colours were English. we
                    spoke her – she answered in broken English, &amp; passed on.
                    still we believed her French &amp; expected she was coming
                    round. it was a Guernsey man who hailed us &amp; I laid down
                    my arms with high delight. – You may conceive the feelings
                    this whole business excited in me, not satisfied with myself
                    for taking up arms – my wife below – in full expectation of
                    an engagement &amp; myself no ways interested in the
                    business – for God knows I think nothing worth fighting for,
                    &amp; my little luggage was insured. there I was going to
                    fight for company-sake – I – who have fired a gun these
                    seven years, &amp; never intended to fire one again. Oh the
                    joy of feeling two legs, two arms, &amp; a head in my own
                    possession! it made my stomach in good humour for half the
                    day. the morning was a busy one. the Endymion Frigate
                    boarded us. &amp; I had the pleasure of seeing porpusses
                    about the ship &amp; a small grampus.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Tuesday evening we saw the Berlings. the next
                    morning I rose with the Sun, &amp; saw the Sun rise over the
                    rock, where he seemed to rest a moment as he rose. we were
                    very near the land – so near that I could see flocks of sea
                    birds sporting over the silver dust of the breakers. any
                    land is a delightful sight – but that magnificent rock!
                    &amp; the heights of <ref target="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</ref> ascended as we passed on, &amp; I saw the
                    Penha, &amp; the summits which I had trod. the very pilot
                    boat, its great sail floundering about like a womans
                    petticoats in a high wind, unmanageable as an umbrella in a
                    storm, seemed like an old acquaintance – I laid hold of the
                    pilot &amp; whetted my jargon Portugueze upon him – at the
                    expence of a testoon<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">A Portuguese coin; four testoons made a cruzado, the
                        highest unit of currency.</note> for my lesson.</p>
<p rend="indent1">
<ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Ediths</ref> eyes
                    quickened mine. hers had not been blunted, &amp; every thing
                    was new. the windmills drawn up in battle array <del rend="strikethrough">amused</del> upon every hill very
                    much amused one of our fellow travellers.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified; but possibly

                        Thomas Beddoes who travelled to Portugal with Southey.
                        He may have been a member of a prominent Bath family of
                        silversmiths, jewellers and surgeons.</note> he saw an

                    with the great coach door – &amp; the sign. we gave him the
                    glass – it was a convent &amp; a crucifix. before we
                    anchored I saw <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my

                    as their filth &amp; laziness. their great hot cloaks – the
                    childrens hair. the straggling chaise mules – all so
