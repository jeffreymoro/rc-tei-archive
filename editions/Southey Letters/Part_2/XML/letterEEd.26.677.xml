<p rend="indent1"> You will doubtless have attributed my silence
                    to its right cause – the expectation daily disappointed of
                    being able to fix determinately the day of my departure. If
                    possible – we move Friday – but I look with alarm to a world
                    of business in the interim &amp; almost fear that <del rend="strikethrough">our</del> the preliminaries cannot
                    be so <del rend="strikethrough">xxx xx</del> &lt;got
                    thro&gt; as to allow the definitive stroke before Monday or

                    be unpleasant to leave London in uncertainty upon that

                        were attempting to raise money to invest in an annuity
                        for her; see Southey to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn,

                    that I laugh while I write. she is in the country &amp; in a
                    farm yard saw for the first time in her life – a well
                    “Curiosity prompted me to examine it, &amp; the method of
                    their drawing up water; – when – by one of those
                    unaccountable motions which sometimes pursue us, I from
                    happening to stand with my back towards the Well while
                    receiving the shock, fell into it. My Jaw bone struck
                    against the edge which enabled me to place my elbow there
                    also, &amp; by that means extricated myself with the loss of
                    only one Shoe. I’ve received several bruises, but – thank
                    God none dangerous.” She means not to tell her Mother of
                    this – so do not you mention it.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Last week there came a letter from <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref>, dated Port

                    stay God knows. Poor fellow he says he had written by the

                        1801-1802. A French expedition had arrived in Haiti on
                        29 January 1802 to re-conquer the colony. Toussaint was
                        forced to surrender on 7 May 1802, but yellow fever was
                        decimating the French troops, who lost 15,000 men to the
                        disease in the first two months of the campaign. French
                        troops finally withdrew from Haiti in December
