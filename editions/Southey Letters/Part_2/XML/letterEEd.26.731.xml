<p rend="indent1"> Your first emendation stands<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">This letter consists of
                        Southey’s response to Grosvenor Bedford’s criticisms of
                        the draft of Book 1 of the <title>Curse of
                            Kehama</title> which had been sent to him on 7
                        October 1802, Letter 726.</note> – albeit I do hanker to
                    kick the word “note” out of doors because it is a musical
                    word – ergo a damned word – a fiddlers word – curse the
                    fellow – I will lay my life the word must be of the neuter
                    gender – or even epicœne – but the objection to the
                    incipient <hi rend="ital">Rose</hi> – is a final objection,
                    &amp; theres an end of it.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Concerning polygamy give me credit till we
                    meet &amp; I show you my <hi rend="ital">written</hi>
                    chapter upon the system of Mohammed.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Muhammad (570-632), Prophet of Islam.
                        Muslim men may have up to four wives.</note> that is a
                    system utterly subversive of individual happiness &amp;
                    general prosperity.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> For the opening – I had thought about the
                    commutation act myself. – &amp; you have given me the detail
                    – read therefore accord to the <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> Edition.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> My stop is thus – Myriads of torches
                    fling</p>
<p rend="indent3"> Their flaring radiance on the gloom,</p>
<p rend="indent4"> Blotting the stars from heaven; –</p>
<p>You may chuse between – rise upward – &amp; ascending – but
                    the image is wanting – at least, to my eye it is a
                    tremendous picture – a sort of hell fire light – a yellow
                    blaze below – &amp; above smoke &amp; blackness.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> for chāuntiňg tȟy sōng ǒf prāise – chuse you
                    which be the most falling to your ear – ănd chāunt tȟe sōng
                    ǒf prāise – to me the first has a more jelly-bag sort of a
                    sound.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Multitude I prefer to train – because it is a
                    bigger word. your association with upright – will be nobody
                    elses association – I pray you let Arvalan sit still. your
                    after annotation I will think about</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Bright &amp; bridal <hi rend="ital">I
                        likes</hi>.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> For in that mighty multitude</p>
<p rend="indent2"> Was none who loves the dead. – my stupid
                    printer made the error, &amp; the stupid reader did not
                    discover it.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> The voice of the coming storm – is perhaps
                    not loud enough. – reserved for the opinion of the Twelve
                        Judges.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">In the
                            <title>Book of Judges</title>, the ‘Twelve Judges’
                        were some of the most famous leaders of Israel after the
                        death of Joshua.</note>
</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Come on – is not bald Sir – &amp; if it be
                    bald Sir tho you put a wig upon <del rend="strikethrough">the</del> it – it will still be bald <del rend="strikethrough">at bottom</del> below it. mark you
                    Sir – what does a big word with a little meaning look like?
                    – Why like me in a Dutchmans breeches.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> A noun substantive can stand by itself – the
                    Devil must be in it then if two substantives cannot stand
                    together – arm in arm Grosvenor –</p>
<lb/>
<p rend="indent2"> Kehama lights the pile – probatum est.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The Latin translates
                        as ‘it is proved’.</note>
</p>
<lb/>
<p rend="indent1"> The <del rend="strikethrough">xxxxx</del>
                    remarks which I have not noticed – conclude I do not like –
                    &amp; as they are not a matter of mere liking – the voice
                    potential may as well be subintellects. But you will
                    perceive the use of your remarks by the alterations they
                    have made – so go on.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> The more dramatic – the more lyric narrative
                    poetry is, the better. this is a main article of my poetical
                    creed. But Grosvenor I have acquired a relish for the
                    research – &amp; the reasoning, &amp; the authoritative tone
                    of history<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey
                        was working on his unfinished ‘History of
                        Portugal’.</note> that threatens to blast many a laurel
                    bud. nor do I merely like it – I look to my history as a
                    sheet anchor of profit, – as a security of a fair support
                    for age or sickness &amp; a something to remain behind me,
                    more substantial than fame. Look now at the allotment of my
                    time – till twelve my <del rend="strikethrough">time</del>
                    labour is sold to this Amadis<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s translation of <title>Amadis of
                            Gaul</title> (1803).</note> (N.B. this is a secret
                    –) I must take exercise – I must eat – I have acquaintance –
                    alas from 9 – to – 12 – make 5 hours out of the 15 of my
                    waking day – &amp; eating walking &amp; visiting incroach
                        <del rend="strikethrough">sorely</del> greatly upon the
                    rest. Kehama will fare the better for you. I shall write
                    sometimes for the sake of the sooner filling a sheet. –
                    Sometimes I stop for pure vexation that there exist in
                    England sources of information which are yet beyond my reach
                    – the views of Hodges<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">William Hodges (1744-1797; <title>DNB</title>), the
                        first English landscape artist to visit India, in
                        1779-1785; he produced <title>Select Views of
                            India</title> (1785-1788).</note> – &amp;

                        (1769-1837), also an artist, and produced six series of
                            <title>Oriental Scenery</title> (1795-1808).</note>

                        (1796-1799).</note> would be actual food for my brain –
                    the very chyle &amp; blood of my <del rend="strikethrough">xxx</del> imagination would be digested from them.
                    there are botanical works for my foregrounds – &amp; these
                    books I know not where to see – tho they ought to be always

<p rend="indent1"> Dear Grosvenor so much was written
                    immediately on receiving yours – the rest of the first book
