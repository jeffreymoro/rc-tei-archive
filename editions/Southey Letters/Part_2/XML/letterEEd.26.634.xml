<p rend="indent1"> The travellers reached us on Monday evening.
                    they had delayed their journey till the bad weather &amp; so
                    were obliged to come half the way with four horses. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">My Mother</ref>
                    bore the journey exceedingly well – no good symptom this –
                    &amp; indeed she is far worse than I had expected. <ref target="people.html#CarlisleAnthony">Carlisle</ref> has
                    been to visit her – she has faith in him – &amp; faith works
                    wonders. he thinks it an even chance that she may get thro
                    the winter. so long ago as when he saw her at <ref target="places.html#Westbury">Westbury</ref> he thought
                    her consumptive, &amp; wonders she has lived till now. it is
                    at least a satisfaction that she has every possible comfort
                    &amp; alleviation – poor <ref target="people.html#HillMargaret">Margaret</ref> had
                    none! – This cursed disease is I now see a family one – an
                        Uncle<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Possibly
                        Southey’s maternal uncle Joseph Hill (dates
                        unknown).</note> – an infant sister<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably <ref target="people.html#SoutheyElizaSister">Eliza

                    &amp; <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my
                        Mother</ref> are proofs enough. I shall be on my guard –
                    &amp; if ever I begin to cough ship myself in time for
                    Lisbon. at present I am well as heart could wish – &amp; the
                    weather has been trying.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> God bless <ref target="people.html#DanversMrs">your good Mother</ref>!
                    – I am writing on the noble desk &amp; the noble carpet –
                    equally delighted with the polish of the one &amp; the
                    colours of the other. the hearse is admirable. I wish <hi rend="ital">that</hi> was unnecessary – that in a house
                    I might draw out my papers in battle array – &amp; my
                    boards, &amp; have a table made for my carpet – &amp; write
                    more luxuriously than ever did Poet before me. this vagabond
                    life will not last very long. if at the years end <ref target="people.html#CorryIsaac">Corry</ref> &amp; I
                    should part – &amp; I should be again afloat – I <del rend="strikethrough">sho</del> will then go to <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> – to the same
                    house with <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Coleridge</ref> &amp; economize
                    there – almost indifferent whether any advancement in life
                    should remove me or not. We should be magnificently lodged
                    for 25£ a year – &amp; my annual expences if settled there –
                    would not outrun 150£. an odd scheme for a Secretary you
                    will say – &amp; yet it is my favourite one &amp; <hi rend="ital">seems</hi> most probable. </p>
<p rend="indent1"> I am of no use whatever to <ref target="people.html#CorryIsaac">Corry</ref> – my place
                    is actually a sinecure – &amp; he will find me too expensive
                    a part of his establishment – if he ever thought of making
                    me a statesman – I never thought of it, &amp; he must easily
                    discover my unfitness. One conversation is enough for that.
                    not for any thing opposite to his own opinions which he
                    hears – an old Jacobine &amp; a new Ministerialist
                    necessarily now talk the same language. both say peace on
                    any terms – the success of Bonaparte<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821, First
                        Consul 1799-1804, Emperor of the French
                        1804-1814).</note> compels the one to acknowledge his
                    talents – the development of the Corsicans character drives
                    the other to execrate his all-sacrificing &amp; all-pliable
                    ambition. But there is a communicativeness &amp; openness in
                    my manners utterly opposite to what statesmen require. every
                    trifling occurrence in life must be mysterious – a visit to
                    the necessary is a secret expedition. if <ref target="people.html#CorryIsaac">Corry</ref> has hired me
                    that he may acquire a character for patronage he will answer
                    that purpose by giving me some easy appointment in Ireland.
                    this his own family believe to be his object – if he has any
                    other, he will &amp; must be disappointed. in that case if I
                    go abroad on my first &amp; favourite scheme – well. – if
                    not I can live upon a little in Cumberland. &amp; devote
                    myself to the History of Portugal<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s uncompleted ‘History of
                        Portugal’.</note> – which from my connections &amp;
                    character must be of considerable emolument. a settled
                    habitation would cut off a fourth of my annual expences. I
                    wish this <hi rend="ital">could</hi> have been done sooner –
                    but I have never yet been a free agent.</p>
<p rend="indent1">
<ref target="people.html#DavyHumphry">Davy</ref> has paid me
                    two morning visits. one the first day of my entering the
                    lodgings – &amp; before I had got in, so that we did not
                    meet. the silent estrangement which I foresaw is growing
                    between us – his regard for &amp; attachment to me grew up
                    briskly – but the thorns have choaked it. this is in the
                    natural course of things – our habits of life &amp; of
                    thinking &amp; of study grow more &amp; more dissimilar. it
                    is not a thing to wonder at – hardly to regret. <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> &amp; he have a knot of union in their
                    metaphysics. a foul weed that poisons whatever it clings to.
                    I have been so accustomed to some glaring folly or fault in
                    almost every one with whom it has been my lot to be
                    connected, that of necessity I am all-tolerant.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Thursday – I should have finished &amp;
                    dispatched this yesterday, but on my return from a walk – a
                    head ache had so increased as to disable me for the day.

                    include the few books which I reviewed at your house since
                    my return to England – therefore as he has not closed my
                    account I may expect more work. as soon as I get the money I
                    will send it down. – I have heard from <ref target="people.html#ThomasWilliamBowyer">Thomas</ref> at
                    last – &amp; written again to him. you will soon receive –
                    if indeed you have not already sent it – the thirty pounds
                    from him. I will write again to enquire where <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncles</ref>
                    boxes may be sent. it hurts me that you should be troubled.
                    the boxes that I have examined are those that should be
                    shipped off – in the new ones I believe there are books
                    which will soon be necessary for my work.</p>
