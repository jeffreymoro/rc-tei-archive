               “Remains;” the alteration in that act having been intended as a favour to authors,
               and partly also as a set-off against the hardship of exacting the eleven copies.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The Copyright Act (1814) provided that
                  copyright would last for 28 years from the time of publication, or the lifetime of
                  the author, if that was longer. It also confirmed that 11 public and university
                  libraries were entitled to copies of all published works. Southey’s <title>Remains
                     of Henry Kirke White, of Nottingham</title> was first published in 1807.</note>
               The “Remains” are your property as long as you live, or either of your sisters,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Frances Moriah White (1791–1854) and
                  Catherine Bailey White (1795–1889). Southey’s allocation of the literary property
                  in the <title>Remains</title> misses out the other surviving sibling, the
                  clergyman James White.</note> considering the work as your joint property. </p><p rend="indent1"> You have now to consider what materials there are which may be
               published with the Illustrations.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">As early
                  as 1812 Neville White seems to have proposed a volume of prints of places
                  celebrated in his brother’s poems. This was intended to complement and capitalise
                  on the popularity of Henry Kirke White’s <title>Remains</title>; see Southey to
                  Neville White, 12 April 1812, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part
                     Four</title>, Letter 2076. </note> We acted imprudently in adding anything
               after the first edition;<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">For example,
                  corrected, expanded fourth and fifth editions of the <title>Remains of Henry Kirke

               gained by it, and the only effect was to lessen the worth of the first edition, and
               expend materials which might now have been turned to account. Did I not some years
               ago examine the MS. volume in my possession with this view, and send you what could
               be gleaned from it? I seem to recollect so, but am not certain.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">See Southey to Neville White, 20 September 1812,

               this year, he is very likely to take Nottingham in his way, certainly could make it
               so without any inconvenience.</p><p rend="indent1"> Your weather, it seems, has been like ours, cold and ungenial. I see
               by the papers that the season has been equally unfavourable in France; unless there
               be a speedy change, the agriculturalists will not have cause to complain of a
               plentiful harvest this year as an aggravation of their distresses.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Times</title>, 15 June 1821, printed a
                  letter from Paris of 11 June, reporting: ‘The weather here is really dreadful:
                  constant rain, and at the same time as cold as in the month of February’. The
                  weather in England had been as bad, with snow falling in London in late
                  May.</note> Here we are in great want of rain. We had a few warm days last week,
               which I made the most of, and took a delicious bath every day up the River Greta,
               about a mile and a half distant.</p><p rend="indent1"> I am now closely employed upon the “History of the Peninsular War,”
               of which the thirty-second sheet is now before me. It is a singularly interesting
               occupation thus to record a series of events the progress of which I watched so
               earnestly and anxiously; and now, with the whole before me, to observe wherein I
               judged rightly at the time, and wherein the opinions which I then formed were
                  erroneous.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>History of
                     the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832), for which he was able to reuse a good
                  deal of the historical material he had produced for the <title>Edinburgh Annual
                     Register, for 1808–1811</title> (1810–1813).</note> I do not find that I was
               mistaken upon any point of importance, except in expecting good from assembling the
                  Cortes.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">The Cortes elected in 1810 to
                  rule those parts of Spain not occupied by France. Southey regarded it as
                  impractical and divisive in its actions.</note> The subject is a noble one, and
               remarkably complete. With the second part of the tragedy I have nothing to do, and
               God knows what the end will be, or who will live to see it.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">An army revolt in 1820 had led to the restoration of the
                  liberal Constitution of 1812, but Spain was torn by divisions between

               meaning, I believe, to send you a copy. You will be pleased with many of them. They
               breathe a sweet strain of natural feeling. There is a tale in Crabbe’s manner, which
               is very well told, but the story is of a kind which excites nothing but pain in the
                  perusal.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey has in mind ‘The
                  Weaver’s Boy. A Tale’ from Townshend’s <title>Poems</title> (London, 1821), pp.
                  58–76. The comparison is with the poet and clergyman George Crabbe (1754–1832;
                     <title>DNB</title>), whose <title>Tales</title> had appeared in 1812 and
                     <title>Tales of the Hall</title> in 1819. Southey probably found ‘nothing but
                  pain’ in ‘The Weaver’s Boy. A Tale’ as it dealt with the death of a child, and he
                  was still grieving for his son, Herbert Southey, who had died in 1816.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> You will doubtless form by degrees a clerical library. They are

               this very useful and laborious man contain the fullest account of whatever concerns

               different direction. They are, however, both safe guides, and sound pillars of our
               Church; for Taylor errs only in accrediting too easily suspicious legends of the
               early Romish church, and in admitting, what is and must be mere supposition to
               assume, in his own mind something like the consistency of belief. You know what the
               late King said of the divines of that age, – “<hi rend="ital">There were giants in

                  had read Bishops, Andrews, Sanderson, Sherlock, &amp;c. The pigmy divine replied,
                  “No, please your Majesty, my reading is all modern. The writers, of whom your
