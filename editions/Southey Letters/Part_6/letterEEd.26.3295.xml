                  designed to prevent British subjects fighting on the side of the revolutionaries in Spanish America. The Bill was, at this time,

                  December 1819. The American crew were all acquitted on the grounds that Captain Ross’s death was an accident.</note> The usual
               questions were asked from the privateer by the Captain<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">John Daniel Danels (1783–1855), American
                  privateer.</note> himself, all in English. Ross was then ordered to lower his boat &amp; go on board. He answered that his boat was
               very leaky &amp; would not swim. The Commander of the privateer replied that if he did not come on board he would fire into him; &amp;
               without waiting for any thing farther, immediately he gave the word to fire, altho Cap<hi rend="sup">t.</hi> Ross had given orders to
               lay the vessel too. The gun was loaded with grape, &amp; killed Ross on the spot, he was struck by several balls, &amp; indeed the
               vessels were so close that the wadding laid open his breast. The Commander came on board in a few minutes, with a boat well manned. One
               of his men set his foot upon the dead body &amp; said he should like to kill an Englishman every day, another boasted that he had fired
               the gun, &amp; had aimed it at the Captain. The Surgeon<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> was the only man
               who seemed sorry for what had happened, &amp; said he would gladly give a thousand dollars that the affair had not occurred, the
               Captain replied that he would not have given half a dollar to have prevented it. The mate<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> was required to sign a paper stating that the Captain had been killed owing to his own obstinacy, but this he
               refused to do. He was asked whether the property was British or Portugueze, &amp; not giving a satisfactory answer was told to put into
               Recife (the nearest port) &amp; obtain a certificate from the British Consul,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">John Lemprière (c.
                  1758–1839), British Consul in Pernambuco 1809–1826.</note> or from his owner or consignee that the property was British; the
               privateer would wait for him, &amp; if he did not bring such a certificate would capture the vessel as carrying property belonging to
               Portugueze subject. The vessel came in to bury the Captain &amp; obtain the certificate, which was given by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Kenworthy<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">William Kenworthy (b. 1768) was a member of a family of cotton

               allowed to proceed on her destination. – A subscription was entered into at Recife for the widow &amp; family of Ross, who was well
               known there. </p><p rend="indent1"> The privateers which infest that coast, &amp; almost blockade Pernambuco, all sail under commission from Artigas,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">José Gervasio Artigas (1764–1850), who was at this time fighting forces from Brazil and Buenos

               possible pretensions to be a maritime power, &amp; the vessel under his flag are owned, commanded &amp; principally manned by subjects
               of the United States (or Englishmen I suppose) – not by persons who acknowledge him as their chief, or have any connection with him, or
                  <del>the</del> territory to which he pretends. And the evil is becoming very serious, if British vessels carrying Portugueze
               property are to be liable to capture, because many English &amp; Portugueze houses are intimately connected in trade.</p><p rend="indent1"> I send you this as tending to show what sort of system is going on under colour of that cause, for which such men as
