               South. On Monday the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this month it is my intention to leave home, &amp; make the best of my way to
               Llangedwin, near Oswestry, where I shall stay with my friend <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">C Williams Wynn</ref>,
               till the Saturday. On that day I shall leave him, &amp; endeavour to reach Ludlow, if it be convenient for you to receive me at that
               time. But if this should <del>xxxx</del> happen to interefere with any of your engagements, it will make no difference to me: in that
               case I will proceed straight from Llangedwin to London, &amp; take Ludlow in my way back at the end of June.</p><p rend="indent1"> The influenza which has prevailed so generally throughout the kingdom, has been very prevalent here. <ref type="m" target="people.html#EdmondsonDr">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Edmondson</ref> never remembers one either so general, or so severe in the
               course of <del>xx</del> seven &amp; thirty years practise. I am the only person in this house who has escaped. It is still hanging upon
                  <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Coleridge</ref>. But as we have had an honest, old
               fashioned, hard winter, such as winters used to be, so it seems as if we were about to have an old fashioned spring, – for of late
               years spring has been more like a prolongation of winter, than the genial season which poets have celebrated, &amp; which I seem to
               remember in my boyhood. The fields are growing green, flowers are opening, buds swelling, birds singing, &amp; the glass is at 63. So I
               am going to London just at the season when instinct would impel one to hasten out of it.</p><p rend="indent1"> About a month ago we lost our excellent old inmate, <ref type="m" target="people.html#WilsonMrs">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Wilson</ref>, in her seventy eighth year. She lingered eight days after a paralytic stroke had deprived her of all her
               senses, &amp; as we hope of all sense of suffering. It was very gratifying to observe how much interest her illness excited among the
               old inhabitants of <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>, &amp; how general a testimony was borne to her worth.
               There are indeed but few who could remember when she was, as they say, “more thought of” than any other young woman in the place, both
               for her beauty &amp; her conduct; but <del>xxx</del> a later generation had learnt to respect her character, &amp; to know her good
               qualities, &amp; she went to her grave with the deserved reputation of having never said an unkind word, nor done an unkind action. She
               disposed of her little property in small legacies, in a very affecting manner. Among other she has left five pounds to each of my
                  girls,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"><ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith May</ref>, <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref>, <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyKate">Kate</ref> and <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Isabel Southey</ref>.</note> &amp; ten to the <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">little boy</ref>, whose name she had <del>x</del>
