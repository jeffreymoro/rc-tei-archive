                  clergyman, scholar, and usher at Westminster School 1806–1821.</note> concerning <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillEdwardJnr">Edward</ref>, for whose interest he seems to feel as warmly as I could wish him. He is of opinion that it will be better not for
               him to stand out for College,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">At Westminster School there are 40 King’s (or Queen’s) Scholars,
                  based in their own boarding house, called ‘College’. Entrance to this elite is by means of an examination known as ‘The Challenge’.
                  Successful Scholars have the right to special privileges; at this time these included Scholarships reserved for them at Christ
                  Church, Oxford, and Trinity College, Cambridge.</note> next year, – because it will require <hi rend="ital">cramming</hi>, (an
               operation which whether it be always beneficial, he doubts; – I, for my part, not doubting that it is always injurious –) – &amp;
               because of his youth &amp; gentleness of disposition. His utmost efforts next year could not be expected to bring him in except among
               the four last, &amp; then – to use Knoxs words “a gentle delicate boy would be subjected to the severest part of a severe discipline.”
               The year after he would probably come in very high. – Knox must be the best judge of all this. – With regard to the discipline of which
               he speaks, it is one of those evils which cry aloud for extirpation, – &amp; against which I should have cried aloud ere this, if it
               were not for the temper of the times, when so many persons would join in the cry for the purpose of mischief. But the oeconomy of our
               public schools stands grievously in need of reform. <ref type="m" target="people.html#GoodenoughEdmund">Goodenough</ref> had an
               opportunity last year of breaking the tyranny which is exercised in College, when a flagrant instance came before him in the case of
               James Moore’s son.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">James Carrick Moore (1762–1860; <title>DNB</title>), doctor and brother and
                  biographer of the military hero, Sir John Moore (1761–1809; <title>DNB</title>). This incident could refer to either of James
                  Moore’s sons, as both attended Westminster School: John Carrick Moore (1805–1898), later a geologist; or Graham Francis Moore, later
                  Esmeade (1806–1883).</note> But I believe that, like most men who are connected with old establishments, he wishes to maintain
               things as they are, &amp; the worse they are, the more does he feel it a point of honour to maintain them.</p><p rend="indent1"> One of the errors in our old school education is exemplified in <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillEdwardJnr">Edwards</ref> own case, –for he is <del>about</del> &lt;nearly&gt; two years more forward than he would have been in the regular course
               of the school, boys usually entering the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> form from the age of 13 to 14. – If <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">my dear Herbert</ref> had lived to reach that age, he would have been advanced enough for the
                  <hi rend="ital">sixth</hi> form, &amp; have <del>learnt</del> acquired as many modern languages as I could have taught him, or

               me they were as much sport as study. – So easily are these things acquired by a willing &amp; apt mind, when it is led in the right
               way. </p><p rend="indent1"> – I should have been very anxious to hear of the children, if the <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Doctor</ref> had not written. – Love to <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillCatherine">my
