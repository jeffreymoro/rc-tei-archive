A
               most unfortunate perversion of mind has made him always desirous of supporting
               strange and paradoxical opinions by ingenious arguments, and showing what may be said
               on the wrong side of a question. He likes to be in a state of doubt upon all subjects
               where doubt is possible, and has often said, ‘I begin to be too sure of that, and
               must see what reasons I can find against it.’ But when this is applied to great and
               momentous truths, the consequences are of the most fatal kind. I believe no man ever
               carried Pyrrhonism<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">A branch of scepticism,
                  promulgated by Aenesidemus (fl. 1st century BC), which cast doubt on our ability
                  to gain knowledge of the world and thus encouraged a spirit of continuous enquiry
                  and the suspension of judgement. </note> farther. But it has never led him into
               immoralities of any kind, nor prevented him from discharging the duties of private
               life in the most exemplary manner. There never lived a more dutiful son. I have seen
               his blind mother<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Sarah Taylor, née Wright
                  (d. 1811).</note> weep when she spoke of his goodness; and his kindness and
               generosity have only been limited by his means.</p><p rend="indent1"> What is more remarkable is, that this habitual and excessive
               scepticism has weakened none of the sectarian prejudices in which he was bought up.
               He sympathises as cordially with the Unitarians in their animosity to the Church and
               State, as if he agreed with them in belief, and finds as strong a bond of union in
               party-spirit as he could do in principle.</p><p rend="indent1"> With regard to his talents, they are very great. No man can exceed
               him in ingenuity, nor in the readiness with which he adorns a subject by apt and
               lively illustrations. His knowledge is extensive, but not deep. When first I saw him,
               three-and-twenty years ago, I thought him the best informed man with whom I had ever
                  conversed.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey and Taylor had met
                  in May–June 1798, while the former had been on a visit to Norfolk.</note> When I
               visited him last, after a lapse of eight years, I discovered the limits of his
               information, and that upon all subjects it was very incomplete.</p><p rend="indent1"> Of his heart and disposition I cannot speak more highly than I think.
               It is my belief that no man every brought a kindlier nature into this world. His
               great talents have been sadly wasted; and, what is worse, they have sometimes been
               sadly misemployed. He has unsettled the faith of many, and he has prepared for his
               own old age a pillow of thorns. To all reasoning, the pride of reason has made him
               inaccessible; and when I think of him, as I often do, with affection and sorrowful
               foreboding, the only foundation of hope is, that God is merciful, beyond our
               expectations, as well as beyond our deserts.</p><p rend="indent1"> Thank you for the copy of Cromwell’s Letters. The transcriber has
               tasked his own eyes, and mine also, by copying them in the very form of the
                  writing.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">White had sent a copy of
                  Oliver Cromwell (c. 1742–1821; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Memoirs of the
                     Protector, Oliver Cromwell, and of His Sons, Richard and Henry. Illustrated by
                     Original Letters, and Other Family Papers</title> (London, 1820). This book had
                  provided one of the occasions for Southey’s ‘Life of Cromwell’, <title>Quarterly
                     Review</title>, 25 (July 1821), 279–347. It reproduced the, to Southey’s eyes,
                  archaic spelling and scribal conventions, including abbreviations and
                  superscripts, of letters by Cromwell and his associates. For example, ‘Assuredly
                  hee that will have &amp; holde a right tranquilitie, must found it in a sweete
                     fruitio<hi rend="sup">n</hi> of God, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> whosoever wants

               them by candle-light. You will by this time have seen my sketch of Cromwell’s Life.
               It is the only article of mine which was ever printed in the Quarterly Review without
               mutilation. <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> has made
               only one alteration; that, however, is a very improper one. I had said that Hampden
               might have left behind him <hi rend="ital">a name scarcely inferior to
                  Washington’s</hi>; and he has chosen to alter this to a <hi rend="ital">memorable

                     Review</title>, 25 (July 1821), 293. Southey’s comparison was between George

                  (1594–1643; <title>DNB</title>), Parliamentarian and opponent of Charles I
                  (1600–1649; King of Great Britain 1625–1649; <title>DNB</title>).</note> The

                     <title>Life of Nelson</title> (1813), an expansion of material originally in
                  the <title>Quarterly Review</title>. Southey did not produce a separate biography
                  of Oliver Cromwell (1599–1658; Lord Protector 1653–1658; <title>DNB</title>), nor
                  did he produce his planned series of ‘English lives’.</note> I spent a week lately
