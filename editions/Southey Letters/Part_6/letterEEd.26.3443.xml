               Crushed it will be beyond all doubt, – but the question is whether it will be cut
               short in its course, or suffered to spend itself like a fever. In the latter case

               It is a misery to see in what manner the press is employed to poison the minds of the
               people, &amp; eradicate every thing that is virtuous, every thing that is honourable,
               every thing upon which the order &amp; peace &amp; happiness of society are founded.

                  hitherto avoided it by only publishing opinion rather than news, so allowing them
                  to sell for only 2<hi rend="ital">d</hi>. per issue. The government had also made
                  a determined effort to prosecute radical newspapers.</note> But the mischief goes
               on in all the stages above them. And if we have any statesmen possessed of sufficient
               foresight to perceive the necessity of curbing the press, there is not one who has
               courage enough to avow it. The German Governments have taken a lesson from Kotzebues

                  von Kotzebue (1761–1819) by the theology student Karl Ludwig Sand (1795–1820) had
                  led to the issuing of the Carlsbad Decrees (1819) by the Federal Assembly of the
                  German Confederation. The Decrees restricted press freedoms, rights of association
                  and the autonomy of universities.</note> The French will probably do the same from

                  the Prince Regent, Elmsley and Davy had been commissioned to try new means of
                  unrolling and transcribing the carbonised papyri that had been discovered in the
                  ruins of Herculaneum, the town destroyed in the eruption of Vesuvius, AD 79.
                  Although Herculaneum had been rediscovered in 1709, the existence of the papyri
                  had not been realised until 1752. By the 1810s their significance for classical
                  scholarship was beginning to emerge. Although Davy and Elmsley applied their
                  scientific and scholarly knowledge to the task, it was abandoned in early 1820.
                  Davy’s findings appeared in his ‘Some Observations and Experiments on the Papyri

                  using an a-b-a-b-a-b-c-c rhyme scheme). Southey attributes the origins of this
                  style to: Francesco Berni (1497/8–1535), famous for his lampoons and satires;
                  Luigi Pulci (1432–1484), <title>Morgante Maggiore</title> (1483); and Ludovico

               blot in the literature of his country, – an act of high treason in English poetry,
               for which the author deserves damnation. The manner has had a host of imitators. The

               – good night. Had circumstances favoured, I might have done more in this way, &amp;
               better. But I have done enough to be remembered among poets; tho my proper place will
               be among the historians, if I live to compleat the works upon yonder shelves.<note n="21" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular
