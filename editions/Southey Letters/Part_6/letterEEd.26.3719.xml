					man could have been secured against ill fortune in his mercantile concerns, by prudence, punctuality, method &amp;
					the virtues &amp; habits which the mercantile profession<del>s</del> requires, you, above all men, would have been
					uniformly &amp; steadily prosperous. And yet to what a series of anxieties &amp; losses have you been exposed,
					without any fault, – or even any thing which can justly be called incaution on your part! These are indeed severe
					trials, &amp; the more so, considering by whom this recent evil has been brought on. My fear now is lest your
						brothers<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">William Henry May (1785–1849), May’s younger brother and business
						partner in Brazil.</note> transactions should have been with those members of the late Government whose persons
					are obnoxious to the ruling party, &amp; whose engagements they appear to have disowned.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">An army revolt in Porto in August 1820 led to the election of a Cortes in December 1820 and demands
						that the monarchy return from Brazil, where it had fled in 1807–1808, following the French invasion. John VI
						(1767–1826; King of Portugal 1816–1826) arrived back in Lisbon on 3 July 1821 and eventually agreed to a new
						liberal Constitution. John VI appointed his son, Pedro (1798–1834; Emperor of Brazil 1822–1831), as Regent in
						Brazil and Pedro summoned an elected advisory council to represent the different Brazilian provinces. These events
						eventually led to the separation of Portugal and Brazil in September 1822; but Brazil did not become a Republic or
						disintegrate. Nor did Brazil or Portugal renege on existing financial commitments.</note> Money for its first
					necessities a revolutionary Government will have by the seizure &amp; sale of Church lands; but the payment of its
					debts is not one of those things which it is likely to consider as first necessary. Nor in the present state of
					those poor &amp; long mis-governed countries is it possible to tell how long the union (now little more than
					nominal) between Portugal &amp; Brazil may continue, nor what course affairs may take in either. This however is
					both consolatory &amp; certain, that no good man is ever the worse for the trials with which Providence may visit
					him. &amp; <del>xx</del> the way &lt;in&gt; which you regard these afflictions exemplifies this. </p><p rend="indent1"> Since I received your letter I made my proposed visit to the seacoast with the two Ediths<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"><ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> and <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith May Southey</ref>.</note> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</ref>.

						man<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">The name of this faithful retainer is unrecorded in histories of the
						Senhouse family.</note> who held an estate under the family was sent to persuade him to this – his unwillingness
					to leave the service in such disastrous times being anticipated; but the result of this endeavour was that Senhouse
					instead of returning persuaded the messenger to remain, &amp; follow the Kings fortune. They were at Marston Moor
					together, &amp; at Naseby.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Two battles of the civil war: Marston Moor, 2
						July 1644, and Naseby, 14 June 1645. Both were defeats for the royalist cause.</note> In the last of those unhappy
					fields Senhouse was dreadfully wounded, his skull was fractured &amp; he was left for dead. After the battle his
					faithful friend searched for the body, &amp; found him still breathing. By this providential aid he was saved, his
					skull was pieced with a plate of metal, &amp; he lived to continue the race. His preserver was rewarded by having
					his estate enfranchised, &amp; both properties continue at this day in their respective descendants. – This is an
					interesting story, &amp; the more so when related, as it was to me, on the spot. The sword which did good service
					in those wars is still preserved. It was made for a twofold <del>service</del> &lt;use&gt;, the back being cut so

					– they were taken from a Roman station<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors">Alauna Carvetiorum, a Roman fort
						and, later, town.</note> on the hill between it &amp; the sea, where a great number of Roman altars &amp;c have
					been found. Some of these are described by Camden, who praises the <del>xx</del> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Senhouse of

						and saw the collection made by the owner, John Senhouse (d. 1604).</note> He disposed them carefully indeed, but
					imprudently, by building them into the front of the house, in some additions or repairs which he was making, &amp;
					there during the course of two centuries they suffered much from weather. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SenhouseHumphrey">My friend</ref> in his alterations has taken them out &amp; preserved them

					to the sea, &amp; it surprized me to see the fearlessness with which he ran to &amp; fro as the waves retired or
