					under my hands, – so that I deceive myself as much in my estimates, as a builder would deceive me in his, if I were
					contracting to have a house built. Interruptions occur even at this season, – &amp; sometimes idleness besets me in
					the shape of a book, – &amp; some times I yield to a different kind of temptation, which is that of working upon
					something for which I am in the humour, &amp; letting that on which I ought to be engaged lay over till the

						(1756–1828; <title>DNB</title>), MP for Carlisle 1786–1790, 1791–1812, 1816–1820, contested and won Cumberland for
						the Whigs on 17 March 1820, holding the seat until his death. He defeated George Howard, Viscount Morpeth
						(1773–1848; <title>DNB</title>), later 6th Earl of Carlisle, MP for Morpeth 1795–1806, MP for Cumberland
						1806–1820. Southey comforted himself by suggesting that Morpeth’s defeat would bestir his father, Frederick
						Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle (1748–1825; <title>DNB</title>), into becoming an active pro-government
						supporter.</note> in a way which is very likely to throw that interest into the opposition scale; &amp; thus to
					injure his own party for the sake of a personal triumph. I know not how the election at Appleby<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Polling in the Westmorland constituency began on 15 March and continued for seven
						days, before Brougham conceded defeat to the Lowther interest.</note> goes on – both parties are very sanguine,
					&amp; yet both ought to <hi rend="ital">know</hi> what the issue must be, <del>without</del> as they have only to
					the number of their former voters, that of the new freeholders whom they have created for the purpose. <ref type="m" target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Brougham</ref> who denies that he abused me upon the hustings at
					the last election, has been complimenting me there now, for the purpose I suppose of making me credit, or seem to
					credit a denial which I know to be false.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Brougham was reported to have
						criticised Southey from the Westmorland hustings on 30 June 1818 during the general election of that year.</note>
					He is a thorough-paced liar, &amp; neither cares what he says, nor what he unsays.</p><p rend="indent1"> Curwen being returned for the county, young Graham will come in for Carlisle, as the hero of
					those very radicals who endeavoured at this election to murder his father.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">One of the two sitting MPs for Carlisle was Sir James Graham, 1st Baronet, of Kirkstall (1753–1825), MP for
						Carlisle 1812–1825, and a supporter of the Lowther interest. He was re-elected in 1820 with Curwen, who then chose
						to sit for Cumberland, where he was also elected, prompting a by-election in Carlisle. Southey suggests that the
						Whigs intended to put up as a candidate Sir James’s son, Sandford Graham, 2nd Baronet (1788–1852), Whig MP for
						Ludgershall 1812–1815, 1818–1826, 1830–1832. The election at Carlisle in 1820 was marred by considerable violence
						and, after the conclusion of the poll on 11 March, Sir James Graham of Kirkstall and his supporters were attacked
						with brickbats and stones as they made their way from the Town Hall to the Bush tavern. However, Southey may have
						been under the impression that Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet, of Netherby (1792–1861; <title>DNB</title>), Whig MP
						for Hull 1818–1820, who had been suggested as a Whig candidate for Carlisle in the general election of 1820, was
						the son of Sir James Graham of Kirkstall and that he would be the candidate. In fact the anti-government
						standard-bearer in the by-election was William James (1791–1861), MP for Carlisle 1820–1826, 1831–1834, MP for
						East Cumberland 1836–1847. </note> You must not give Curwen too much credit for his speech to those Radicals; it
					was made with a view <del>of</del> &lt;to&gt; the <hi rend="ital">County</hi>, – &amp; there was a supplementary speech
					to make all smooth again, that they might not pelt him when he was chaired.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Times</title>, 21 March 1820, carried an account of Curwen’s speech from the hustings at the opening
						of the poll for Carlisle on 10 March. Curwen had denounced the radicals and their principles, and much of the
						crowd was hostile towards him. However, all was not as it seemed, and Curwen was actually in a secret alliance
						with the radical candidate, William James, to try and defeat the other sitting MP, Sir James Graham, of
						Kirkstall.</note></p><p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> S.</ref> hopes that
