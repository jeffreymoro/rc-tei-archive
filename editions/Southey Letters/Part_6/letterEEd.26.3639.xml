						literature given in Paris in 1820 by the Irishman Thomas Mulock (1789–1869), a failed merchant, political
						reactionary, and associate of George Canning. Something of the tone of Mulock’s lectures is encapsulated by Thomas
						Moore who was in Paris at the time they were given. On discovering that he ‘was to be one of the victims of …
						[Mulock’s] tomahawk’, Moore put off his proposed attendance at them until a later day, <title>The Journal of
							Thomas</title> Moore, eds Wilfred Sellars Dowden, Barbara Bartholomew, and Joy L. Linsley, 2 vols (East
						Brunswick, N.J., 1983), I, p. 367. Moore had earlier described Mulock as ‘a pedantic young Irishman, and a mighty
						genius in his own estimation’ (I, p. 63). Mulock found ungodliness in everywhere and in everyone. On his return to
						England in 1821 he became a dissenting preacher in Staffordshire and, in later life, was confined as a lunatic on
						several occasions.</note></p><closer><salute rend="indent1">believe me my dear Sir</salute><salute rend="indent2"> Yrs very truly</salute><signed rend="indent3"> Robert Southey.</signed></closer></div></body></text></TEI>
