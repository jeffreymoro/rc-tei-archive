               an answer. She is very indignant about the Queen.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Ann Hughes had sent Southey some of the
                  anti-radical satires that her son, John Hughes (1790–1857; <title>DNB</title>), had been publishing; for example, <title>The Radical Harmonist</title>
                  (1820), <title>Solomon Logwood</title> (1820) and <title>The Asses Skin Memorandum Book, Lost in St Paul’s</title> (1820); see
                  Southey to Mary Anne Hughes, 28 November 1820, Letter 3569. Under extreme pressure from George IV, the Cabinet had reluctantly
                  agreed to introduce a Bill of Pains and Penalties into the House of Lords to deprive the King’s wife, Caroline of Brunswick
                  (1768–1821; <title>DNB</title>), of the title of Queen and to dissolve her marriage to the King. On the Third Reading of the Bill on
                  10 November 1820, the government majority was only nine votes and it seemed very unlikely the Bill could pass the House of Commons.
                  Lord Liverpool, the Prime Minister, therefore had announced the Bill would be withdrawn.</note></p><p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> tells me I must not be surprizd if farther
               measures should be taken in this detestable business; &amp; at something of this kind the Courier<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>Courier</title>, 22 November 1820, had called on members of the House of Lords to prove by ‘some decisive
                  measure’ that they were not supporters of adultery, even though the Bill of Pains and Penalties had been withdrawn, and the charges
                  of adultery against Queen Caroline brought forward in the debates on the Bill had, therefore, not been proven.</note> seems to hint.
               On the other hand I hear that Lord Grey<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey (1764–1845;
                     <title>DNB</title>), leading Whig and later Prime Minister 1830–1834.</note> is heartily vexed at having given Ministers an
               excuse for not sending the Bill to the H Commons where it would certainly have been thrown out on the first reading. For reckoning upon
               a like proportion of Whigs &amp; Cowards in both houses, you would have the Radical Members to aid them, &amp; the <del>x</del> greater
               number of Members for large towns, who as they must either <del>have</del> vote<del>d</del> with the Mob, or lose their seats at the
               next election, would have found some specious excuse for obeying the will of the rabble. – Ministers therefore no doubt would gladly
               let the matter rest, but this will not be in their power. The Queen is in the hands of a gang (rather than a party) who will go any
               lengths to bring about a revolution, &amp; she is ready enough to go all lengths with them. So much the better if this accelerates the
               crisis, for the longer that crisis is delayed the more perilous it will be.</p><p rend="indent1"> I give you joy however of a two months respite. Your evenings will be more agreeably spent in Wales than in
                  Pandemonium.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Pandemonium was the capital of Hell in John Milton (1608–1674;
                     <title>DNB</title>), <title>Paradise Lost</title> (1667); it was also Southey’s term for the House of Commons. Following the
                  abandonment of the Bill of Pains and Penalties, the Cabinet had suspended parliament; it did not reassemble until 23 January
                  1821.</note></p><closer><salute rend="indent2">God bless you</salute><signed rend="indent3"> RS.</signed></closer><postscript><p rend="indent0"><date when="1820-11-28">28 Nov. 1820.</date><address><placeName> <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>.</placeName></address></p></postscript></div></body></text></TEI>
