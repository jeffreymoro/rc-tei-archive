His
                  death was widely reported, and the <title>Gentleman’s Magazine</title>, 126 (October 1819), 372–374, published an extended obituary.
                  Dauncey and his two daughters had visited Southey at Keswick in 1818; see Southey to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, 4 November 1818,
                     <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Five</title>, Letter 3204.</note> – except when thro the same channel, some

                  Dolignon (1769–1804), had died in February 1804, at Theobalds, Hertfordshire, ‘after a lingering and painful illness’;
                     <title>Gentleman’s Magazine</title>, 74 (February 1804), 188. Southey had spent much time in the holidays from Westminster School
                  at Theobalds and composed ‘Stanzas written after a long absence’, <title>Morning Post</title>, 20 October 1803 (later retitled ‘To
                  Mary’) to celebrate his intense early friendship with Marie Dolignon (as she then was).</note> I cannot forbear writing to you on
               this occasion, – not for the vain purpose of attempting to offer consolation, – (you have been taught to look for that to the only
               source from whence it can proceed, – ) but to request that when your feelings &amp; your leisure may permit, you will tell me how you
               are, &amp; where you are, that I may know where to seek you, if at any time I should be within reach, &amp; where to address you when
               any opportunity occurs of recalling myself to your remembrance. – To say more would be unseasonable at this time, – &amp; indeed I

               if with an unhappy gift of foresight, which I have too often had reason to regret. – Yet when I thought of being in London (where I
               expected to have been at this time) the hope of seeing him &amp; you was among the compensations for leaving home to which I had looked
