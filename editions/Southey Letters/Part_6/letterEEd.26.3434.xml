                  J. Jones was fictitious the publishers may have been Samuel August Oddy (1779–1847) and Henry Oddy (1782–1847), booksellers and
                  printers, specialising in maps. They had previously had premises at 20 Warwick Lane, but had gone bankrupt in 1815.</note> At the

                  in which Mr. Southey’s name is used for the purpose of deceiving country purchasers, and misspelled in the hope that the fraudulent
                  publisher may be enabled to evade the law. Other newspapers, we trust will insert this notice as an act of justice to the individual
