           <p rend="indent1"> I hope your children<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey Jnr (b. 1817); Charles Gonne Southey (1819–1861), later an army officer in India; and Louisa Mary Southey (1821–1824).</note> are not seriously ill. Indeed as you speak of them all together, I persuade myself that they have some epidemic or infectious complaint.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">  Can you tell <del>x</del> me how to remedy in its commencement <del>a very unpleasant</del> a weakness of the eyelids, which I well know may in its consequences be very distressing. About tea time <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyKate">Kate</ref> finds her lids disposed to close of themselves, they fall <del>xxx</del> half over her eyes, &#38; she rubs them to keep them up, – the affection having nothing to do with drowsiness, – but evidently a weakness or relaxation of the muscles. I rub the lid with camphorated spirits of wine<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Camphor dissolved in wine that had been repeatedly distilled. It was a widely used remedy, including for forms of palsy.</note> &#38; send her to bed early. Can I use any tonics, – local or general?</p>

            <p rend="indent1">Except in the affair of <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyKate">Kates</ref> eyes which I hope may be remedied by being taken in time, we are going on well. <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> I think is in better health &#38; spirits than she has been for many years, – a few months ago she was in worse, so as to give me very serious apprehensions. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith May</ref> has still the same some kind of eruption – (by the by the lancet never arrived) – I hope we shall have an opportunity of sending her to Harrowgate ere long with <ref type="m" target="people.html#HutchinsonSara">Miss Hutchinson</ref>.</p>

The Two Foscari, A Tragedy.

The ‘calumnies’ Byron believed him to have later spread were rumours that Byron and Shelley had engaged in a ‘League of Incest’ during their residence in Switzerland in 1816. Southey had responded by writing to the Editor of the <title>Courier</title>, 5 January 1822, Letter 3776.
