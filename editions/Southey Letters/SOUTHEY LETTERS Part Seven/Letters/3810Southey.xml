            <p rend="indent1">I am grieved at the uncomfortable tone of your letter: &#38; just now am in no condition to answer it, having a sick house, &#38; being myself by no means well. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</ref> has a bilious fever upon him, which is not called alarming, but is quite sufficient to make me very uneasy, &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">my eldest daughter</ref> is far from well.</p>

This is not a healthy feeling, &#38; I wish most earnestly that you would shake it off. A month among the mountains would be of infinite use to you, in putting your spirits &#38; feelings to rights. As for retiring into a hollow tree it was done by an English Saint who for so doing was named Simon Stok.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">St Simon Stock (13th century), English saint and early Prior-General of the Carmelite Order. One tradition about him states that as a boy he retired to live as a hermit in the hollow trunk of an oak tree.</note> But I would neither have you turn Stock or Stone<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">A common phrase, meaning wood or stone.
