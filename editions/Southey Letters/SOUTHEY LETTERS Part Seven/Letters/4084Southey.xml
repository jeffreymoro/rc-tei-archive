            <p rend="indent1">I am just arrived at the Tontine Inn<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The Tontine Inn, Haymarket, Sheffield. Built in c. 1786, the Inn was, in the 1820s, the leading hotel in Sheffield, much of its trade coming from coach passengers passing through the city.</note> &#38; must leave it as soon as it is light tomorrow morning: but I should be sorry to pass thro Sheffield without seeing you. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">My eldest daughter</ref> is with me &#38; some Ladies<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"><ref type="m" target="people.html#CharterLouisa">Louisa Charter</ref>, and Elizabeth Charter (1782–1860), friend of the poet George Crabbe (1754–1832; <title>DNB</title>). They were the sisters of <ref type="m" target="people.html#PeachyEmma">Emma Peachy</ref>, first wife of William Peachy, and nieces of Sir Charles Malet (1752–1815; <title>DNB</title>), 1st Baronet, prominent diplomat with the East India Company. Peachy had lent the Charter sisters his home on Derwent Island. They were accompanied by Lady Susanna Malet, née Wales (1779–1868), widow of Sir Charles Malet, 1st Baronet (1752–1815; <title>DNB</title>), maternal uncle of the Charter sisters. Their other companion was one of Sir Charles Malet’s three children in India with Amber Kaur (b. 1772): Eliza (b. 1791); Henry Charles (1793–1844); and Louisa (b. 1795). They accompanied him to Britain in 1798 and were brought up with his children by Susanna Malet. Eliza Malet married, in 1812, Robert Ekins (1785–1874), Vicar of Godalming 1810–1833, Rector of Folke, Dorset 1833–1843, Perpetual Curate of North Wootton 1843–1854. Southey is probably referring here to Louisa Malet.</note> whom we have accompanied from <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> on our way to London. If you are not engaged, I <del>think</del> hope &#38; think you will come &#38; shake hands with me, – that we may not lose this opportunity of seeing each other in this world.</p>
