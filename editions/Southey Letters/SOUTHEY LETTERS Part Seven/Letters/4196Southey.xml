           <p rend="indent1"> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Southey presents his Compliments to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canning &#38; thanks him for transmitting M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Somervilles book.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">William Clarke Somerville (1790–1826), <title>Letters from Paris on the Cause and Consequences of the French Revolution</title> (1822), no. 2569 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. Somerville was a plantation-owner in Maryland, author, soldier and diplomat. Somerville had presumably sent Canning a copy of this book, expecting him to send it on to Southey.</note> At the same time he feels it necessary to say that that Gentleman is altogether a stranger to him, &#38; that he has been in no degree accessory to the liberty which has been taken with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canning on this occasion</p>
