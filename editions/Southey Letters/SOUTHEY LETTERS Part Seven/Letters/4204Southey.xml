            <p rend="indent1"> You see I judged rightly concerning the encouragement which <ref type="m" target="people.html#WilkinSimon">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wilkin</ref>, was likely to find from the London Book-sellers.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Wilkin had proposed a new edition of the works of Sir Thomas Browne (1605–1682; <title>DNB</title>), the Norwich resident, doctor and writer on a huge range of subjects. ‘The Whole Works and Correspondence of Sir Thomas Browne, Knt. M. D. of Norwich’ was soon advertised as forthcoming with Longmans, for example in the <title>London Courier and Evening Gazette</title>, 2 October 1824. This was an early indication of Simon Wilkin’s edition, which did not appear until 1835–1836. Southey did not edit or review this work, though he obtained a copy, no. 376 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note> This is a subject on which they are necessarily the best judges. A second edition is not to be hoped for in a case like this, nor do I think there is any reasonable expectation, that so large an edition as 1000 will sell. I advise him not to print more than 750, &#38; tell him further, that highly desirable as such a collection is of this authors works, it would be prudent not to venture more than 500 –</p>
            <p rend="indent1">The best service I can render him will be to review the book which of course is incompatible with editing it. Edite it I ought not to do unless I could allow to it the time &#38; care necessary for doing it in a manner creditable to myself. This I cannot give, &#38; the speculative cannot afford to purchase – <ref type="m" target="people.html#WilkinSimon">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wilkins</ref> had better take Johnsons Life, to which Kippis’s Account (if it contain much additional information) may be annexed.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Christian Morals: by Sir Thomas Browne, of Norwich, M.D. and Author of Religio Medici. the Second Edition. with a Life of the Author, by Samuel Johnson; and Explanatory Notes</title> (London, 1756), pp. i–lxi. The first edition was published posthumously in 1716; the second edition was edited by Samuel Johnson (1709–1784; <title>DNB</title>). Andrew Kippis (1725–1795; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Biographia Britannica</title>, 2nd edn, 5 vols (London, 1778–1793), II, pp. 627–637. Wilkins opened his edition of 1835–1836 by reprinting Johnson’s ‘Life’.</note> Let him then arrange the Works chronologically with brief notes affixed to each, when it was first published – thro how many editions it has past, &#38; what Edition has been followed in the reprint. And if he is desirous of reducing the bulk of the work throw away all the annotations of other writers, except Sir Cor&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The transcriber has left a space. Warter supplies ‘Kenelm’. Sir Kenelm Digby (1603–1665; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Observations upon Religio Medici, Occasionally Written by Sir Kenelme Digby, Knight</title> (1643).</note> Digbys remarks. All that remains will be to take especial care that it be correctly printed, &#38; state in a brief &#38; modest preface the motives for forming the Collection the pains which have been taken in obtaining unpublished papers &#38; the success with which that search has been attended.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> The Correspondence should either follow the Life, if it be at all upon domestic &#38; familiar character, but if it relates wholly (as is most likely) to discursive subjects such as were the object of his studies, it had better then be placed at the end of the collection<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Wilkin placed Browne’s correspondence at the end of his edition.</note> –</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> A review in the Q will be of much greater advantage to <ref type="m" target="people.html#WilkinSimon">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wilkin</ref> than my name as Editor could be &#38; what I should have written as a Life, Preface, or Introduction, may just as well be cast into that form –</p>
