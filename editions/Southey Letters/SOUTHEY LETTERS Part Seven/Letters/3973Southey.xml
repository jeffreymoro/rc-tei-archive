<salute>My dear Harry</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> has at last desired me to apply for a grant of lands in Canada, – &#38; not content with my application, has written, unknown to me (<hi rend="ital">more suo</hi>)<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">‘in his usual way’.</note> to Lord Bathurst,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst (1762–1834; <title>DNB</title>), Secretary of State for War and the Colonies 1812–1827.</note> to ask also for an official situation there! His own letter had it been unbacked, I suspect would have brought him nothing but a dry denial. &#60;- official situations there being none to bestow&#62; But to <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynns</ref> application “every facility” was promised, &#38; Wilmot<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Robert Wilmot-Horton (1784–1841; <title>DNB</title>), Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies 1821–1828.</note> personally said he should be glad to render him any service when he came to town. Whether he will think it needful to go to town I know not, – convenient I am sure it will not be. But as the next business is to ascertain what will be granted him, &#38; what steps are to be taken, I have asked <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> whether the better way would not be for you to consult with Wilmot; – if he thinks so, he will let you know. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheySarah">Sarah</ref>, it seems, approves the intention, – &#38; has friends at Quebec and at Montreal,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Especially Matthew Bell (1769–1849), a wealthy merchant, iron manufacturer and land speculator in Quebec, originally from Berwick-upon-Tweed. He was a relative of Sarah Southey.</note> upon whom they count for useful hospitality. – Of the prudence &#38; necessity of this step there can be no doubt.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> has paid me for the volume<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The first volume of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832). Murray had offered Southey one thousand guineas for this work; see Southey to Herbert Hill, 18 July 1813, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Five</title>, Letter 2283. However, when the <title>History</title> grew from the two volumes proposed in 1813 to three, Murray raised this to £1,500.</note> in two bills of long date, – adding, as he ought, a third to the sum for which we agreed, – because the bargain was for two volumes. I remit the bills by this post to <ref type="m" target="people.html#MayJohn">J May</ref>,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to John May, 3 March [1823], Letter 3971.</note> – about 150£ I shall have occasion for in the course of the month.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Richard Westall (1765–1836; <title>DNB</title>) produced a set of six illustrations, <title>Illustrations of Roderick, the Last of the Goths.

Longman published them and purchasers could arrange for the engravings to be bound into their copy of <title>Roderick</title> (1814). Southey secretly invested some of his earnings from the <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832) in this venture. </note> By <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murrays</ref> account, <ref type="m" target="people.html#ReesOwen">Rees</ref> (for the <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmen</ref>) shuffled dirtily out of the concern, thinking the time was gone by, &#38; that it would not be a good adventure. It has proved a very good one, answering <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murrays</ref> best expectations.</p>
