            <p rend="indent1">The ostensible note inclosed herewith will, it is to be hoped, procure for me these provoking books<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had read John Mitford’s ‘On Spanish Literature, with some Account of Francisco de Olivarez’, <title>New Monthly Magazine</title>, 10 (October 1818), 221–223. It mentioned Olivarez’s <title>Account of the War in Catalonia</title>, published in four volumes at Seville in 1815; <title>Anecdotes of Chiefs Employed in the Catalan War</title> (1816); and <title>Memoirs of the Spanish Monarchy to the Abdication of Charles 4 &#38; the Usurpation of Joseph Bonaparte</title> (1816). However, none of these works seem to exist. Southey had already asked Murray to try and acquire them; see Southey to John Murray: 10 July 1820, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3509; 27 February 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3641; 11 June 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3693; and 27 July 1822, Letter 3877; and 1 November [1822], Letter 3911. Murray had then written to Spain to try and obtain these books for Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832), and Herbert Hill had also offered to help. Finally, Southey had sought the assistance of George Canning. It is possible that this letter to Wynn was prompted by the news that the books could not be found at Madrid, and was accompanied by a note asking for a search to be made at Seville; see Southey to Herbert Hill, 9 May 1824, Letter 4185.</note></p>
           <p rend="indent1"> I have Hubbards book.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">William Hubbard (1621/2–1704), <title>Narrative of the Troubles with the Indians in New England</title> (1677) and <title>Narrative of the Indian Wars in New England</title> (1803), nos 1385 and 1266 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. These were both important sources for Southey’s unfinished epic, ‘Oliver Newman’, set in New England. A fragment was published posthumously in <title>Oliver Newman: a New-England Tale (Unfinished): with Other Poetical Remains by the Late Robert Southey</title> (London, 1845), pp. 1–90. </note> If you possess them not, you should get Cotton Mathers Magnalia Christi,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Cotton Mather (1663–1728), <title>Magnalia Christi Americana, or the Ecclesiastical History of New England, from 1620 to 1698</title> (1702), no. 1904 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> – &#38; the Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, from the commencement in 1792 to 1823</title> (1806–1823), no. 1819 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> my two great storehouses. The latter contain a great number of interesting papers; the former is one of the most extraordinary books in the world, – &#38; both well deserve a place in such a library as yours.</p>
