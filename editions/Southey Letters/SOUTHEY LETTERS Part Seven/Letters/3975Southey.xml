<opener><salute>My dear Sir</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">I can at last thank you for your Verses on the death of the miserable <ref type="m" target="people.html#ShelleyPercyBysshe">Shelley</ref>,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Barton’s <title>Verses on the Death of Percy Bysshe Shelley</title> (1822).</note> which did not reach me till yesterday evening, whereby you will perceive that my communication with the booksellers is not very frequent. But this parcel has been a fortnight longer than it should have been, on the way, owing I suppose to the accumulation of packages in the warehouse during the continuance of snow. The panegyrical Elegy<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">John Chalk Claris (c. 1797–1860; <title>DNB</title>) [Arthur Brooke], <title>Elegy on the Death of Percy Bysshe Shelley</title> (1822).</note> which called forth your wiser verses was sent me also by its author, whom I know not, but who probably writes under a <hi rend="ital">nom de guerre</hi>. Whether the sending it was intended as a compliment, or as an insult, is to me a matter of perfect indifference. <ref type="m" target="people.html#ShelleyPercyBysshe">Shelleys</ref> is a flagitious history, and by far the worst tragedy in real life which has ever fallen within my knowledge. As I told him myself in the last communication I had with him, it is truly the Atheist’s Tragedy.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to Shelley, 12 October 1820, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3538, in which Southey invoked Cyril Tourneur (d. 1626; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Atheist’s Tragedy</title> (1611). The eponymous ‘Atheist’ kills himself at the end of the play.</note></p>
	<p rend="indent1">It is indeed a strange piece of ill-fortune that an act of robbery should have drawn upon you so heavy a burthen of unprofitable and ungrateful employment: and but a poor satisfaction that when this unusual imposition is over the regular task work will appear almost like a holyday.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Barton was a clerk in Messrs Alexander’s Bank in Woodbridge. The Ipswich branch of the bank sustained a major loss on 11 September 1822 when a parcel of banknotes, to the value of over £30,000, which it had received from their London bankers, was stolen from the mail coach at Colchester. The bank offered a reward of £5,000 for information leading to the recovery of the notes but ended up having to negotiate their return with the thieves.</note> Meantime however your name is making its way, and I think I might venture to predict, that if you were to try a volume of tales in verse, you would find a lucrative adventure.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">Peradventure I may see you in the course of spring, as I have the intention of passing a day with <ref type="m" target="people.html#ClarksonThomas">Thomas Clarkson</ref> on the way between Norwich and London.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Barton and Southey did indeed meet at Thomas Clarkson’s house in 1824.</note> Farewell, and believe me Yours truly</p>

            <postscript><p rend="indent1">When you see <ref type="m" target="people.html#MoorEdwardMajor">Major Moor</ref> have the goodness to present my remembrances to him, and say that I received his friendly letter yesterday, and with it the Ms. Volume.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Possibly letters and documents collected by Sir Augustus Simon Frazer (1776–1835; <title>DNB</title>), a career soldier, who had seen service in the Peninsular campaign as a highly effective senior commander of horse artillery. He was Moor’s brother-in-law, and Moor had offered these papers to help with Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note></p></postscript>
