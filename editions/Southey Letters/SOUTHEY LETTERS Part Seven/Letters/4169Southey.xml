            <p rend="indent1">The answer from Penrith<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">From a Miss Walmesley of Penrith, who was intending to travel to London and might have accompanied Bertha Southey.</note> did not arrive yesterday: &#38; now that it is come, we are still in the same quandary, or as it is called in the Lingoa Grande<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The language Southey had made up to mimic the speech of Sara Coleridge.</note> twittarumpiter. For nothing can be done in that quarter. The result therefore is, that unless a letter from you should come to say that <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref> can be received somewhere, – if she were &#60;to&#62; arrive on Thursday the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, – she must wait for another chance. If <del>she</del> you should have made any arrangement she will set out with Miss Tolson<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Tolson (dates unknown). She had set up business in High Holborn, London, as a ‘linen-draper, dealer and chapwoman’. Declared bankrupt on 8 July 1826, she started a new business in Regent Street as a ‘milliner and dress maker’ only to go bankrupt again on 16 May 1828.</note> on Monday. I shall write to the Rickmans<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"><ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">John Rickman</ref> and his family.</note> by this post. You will observe that in all this the only evil is a little consumption of pen, ink, paper &#38; time, falling mostly upon my poor Pilgarlicship.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">A ‘pilgarlic’ was a foolish person, looked on with humorous contempt.</note> And moreover that there has been some good in it, for <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref> would really not have been in a proper state to have commenced such a journey this day. She has had the prevailing cold very severely, &#38; is by no means thoroughly recovered. And as some compensation for her disappointment, there will be the visit to Rydale.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> My cold has done me no good; but it is better to day. Wade Browne<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Wade Browne (1796–1851), the only son of Wade Browne and later a country gentleman at Monkton Farleigh in Somerset. He had been travelling in the Near East.</note> arrived yesterday &#38; leaves us tomorrow. <ref type="m" target="people.html#CalvertWilliam">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Calvert</ref> dines here to day to meet him.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> I do not think there is any news to send you, unless it be that the same <ref type="m" target="people.html#BicknellJohnLaurens">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bicknell</ref> who sent me a book superbly bound in blue morocco last year has now sent me one in green, – a tragedy dedicated to my honour &#38; glory.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">John Laurens Bicknell, <title>The Hour of Trial; a Tragedy</title> (London, 1824), [unpaginated], contained a dedication to ‘ROBERT SOUTHEY, LL.D./ POET LAUREATE,/ A SCHOLAR AND A GENTLEMAN,/ WHOSE NAME WILL EVER BE PROUDLY ASSOCIATED/ WITH THE/ LITERARY HISTORY OF HIS COUNTRY’. The book bound in blue was Bicknell’s <title>The Modern Church, a Satirical Poem: Comprising Sketches of Some Popular and Unpopular Preachers</title> (1820). A morocco-bound presentation copy of this, along with <title>The Hour of Trial</title>, was no. 286 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. </note></p>
