Like his father, Phillimore was educated at Westminster School (1817–1824) and Christ Church, Oxford (BA 1828, MA 1831). In later life he was variously a Clerk at the Board of Control 1827–1832, a barrister and a Liberal MP for Leominster 1852–1857. In 1820 Phillimore had passed ‘The Challenge’ examination and became one of 40 King’s Scholars at Westminster. They had their own house known as ‘College’ and considerable privileges, including the right to proceed to closed scholarships at Trinity College, Cambridge, or Christ Church, Oxford. Edward Hill had just become a member of ‘College’.</note> than for <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillEdwardJnr">Edward</ref>.

He was one of the prime movers behind the Marriage Amendment Act (1822), which legalised marriages that had been undertaken in contravention of the terms of the Marriage Act (1753), where both parties were still living together and if neither one of the parties sued to end the union in an ecclesiastical court. He also favoured Catholic Emancipation.</note></p>

The person so appointed is to write an annual essay, &#38; receive 100 guineas a year. Now it is quite as well to receive 100 £ for an article in the Q.R. as far as profit is concerned, &#38; in other points a great deal better.
