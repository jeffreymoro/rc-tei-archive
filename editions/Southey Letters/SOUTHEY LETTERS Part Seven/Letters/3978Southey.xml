	<p rend="indent1">Your two packets arrived safely. The dirty letter from Porto was worth sending, tho it contains much less than one might reasonably have expected to find in it.

Make my acknowledgements for them. I never heard of the work, but no person can do amiss by giving me books, – &#38; I wish that truth were more generally understood, as it deserves to be, when I really want about two hundred pounds worth.</p>

            <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#LittletonEdwardJohn">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Littletons</ref> appearance &#38; speech at the dinner to the Sp. &#38; P. Ambassadors surprized me; <del>xx</del> in all likelihood he would express the feelings of the Wellesleys upon this subject;<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">A public dinner was held at the City of London Tavern on 7 March 1823 to support the Spanish liberal regime that had taken power after the revolution of 1820. France was threatening to invade Spain to restore royal absolutism. The guests of honour were Juan Jabat Aztal (1772–1825), the Spanish Ambassador 1822–1823, João Francisco de Oliveira (dates unknown), the Portuguese chargé d’affaires 1821–1822, and Lorenzo Fernandez de Villavicencio y Canas, 3rd Duke of San Lorenzo and Valhermoso (1778–1859), formerly Spanish Ambassador to France. Littleton was one of a number of eminent speakers and proposed a toast to ‘Civil and Religious Liberty all over the World’. Littleton was a supporter of Canning, but might be expected to know the thoughts of <ref type="m" target="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">Wellington</ref> and his brother, <ref type="m" target="people.html#WellesleyMarquis" >Marquess Wellesley</ref>, on Spain as he was married to Wellesley’s daughter, Hyacinthe Mary (d. 1849).</note> &#38; that they should desire a war, appears altogether unaccountable. I can conceive only three classes of men who wish for war; the holders of Sp. stock; – the agriculturists who want provisions &#38; rents to be raised, – &#38; the Whigs who are for revolution every where, &#38; who if they had lived during the war in Heaven, would have given a dinner in honour of the Devil &#38; his Angels.</p>
<p rend="indent1">	Lord W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Bentinck is offended with the Government, &#38; being not a very wise man has become a factious one.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Lord William Henry Cavendish-Bentinck (1774–1839; <title>DNB</title>), Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean 1811–1816, Governor-General of India 1828–1835. Bentinck acted as chairman at the public dinner on 7 March 1823. He proposed a toast to ‘The Constitutional King of Spain and the Spanish Nation’. In the course of his speech he claimed ‘in the year 1808, when the Spanish Deputies came to this country, they had still abundant resources, and were enabled to send into the field an army well equipped to combat the foe. But now the case was very different, in consequence to their having been subjected to a long and desolating war.’</note> He spoke either falsely or ignorantly in representing the condition of the Sp. as to means of defence, as being worse than in 1807. Their army no doubt is bad enough, – but must of necessity be much better than it was then, &#38; <hi rend="ital">all the fortresses</hi> are in their own hands. This he kept out of sight; – &#38; he kept out of sight also, the real point in which their present weakness lies, – that they are a divided people, governed by a minority. – The expediency of the French interference is a very doubtful question. They may rout the Sp. armies &#38; occupy Madrid, without restoring order in Spain. Our policy is clearly to remain neutral. If they can establish an efficient government which may &#60;put&#62; an end to clubs, mob-law, &#38; such executions as that of Gen. Elio,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Francisco Javier de Elío y Olóndriz (1767–1822) was an army commander and one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the royal absolutism that was restored in Spain in 1814. He was convicted by a military court of involvement in an army revolt in Valencia on 30 May 1822 and was publicly garotted on 4 September 1822.</note> such an issue would undoubtedly be good. If on the other hand they involve themselves in a harrassing contest, it will be to our advantage in this respect, that they will fail in obtaining a preponderating influence over the Spanish counsels. For my own part I know not what to look for; but this I am sure, that there is nothing at issue which is worth a wish. Between two evils so great, as the old despotism of Spain, &#38; the Cortes with its present Constitution,<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Following the revolution of 1820, the liberal Constitution of 1812 was restored and a Cortes was elected.</note> if a feather could turn the beam, I should not know in which scale to <del>place</del> lay it.</p>
