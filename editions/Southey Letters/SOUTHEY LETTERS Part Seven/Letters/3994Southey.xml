<salute>My dear Sir</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">It was with no little pleasure that I recognized your hand writing yesterday upon a casket (fit word for what contains a treasure) of that sea plant<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Kenyon had sent a present of laver, an edible seaweed and a favourite of Southey’s.</note> which I conceive to have originally sprung from ambrosia seeds dropt by Jupiter when he took the water with Europa<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Ambrosia was the food of the gods in Greek myth and Jupiter the Roman equivalent of Zeus, the king of the gods. Zeus took the form of a white bull to abduct Europa and swum with her on his back to the island of Crete.</note>, &#38; “evolved thro all the intestinal God”.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">For Southey’s plan for a poem – ‘Laver; how it was ambrosia, which when Jupiter came for Europa was evolved through all the intestinal government’ – see <title>Common-Place Book</title>, ed. John Wood Warter, 4 series (London, 1849–1850), IV, p. 21. </note> Some five &#38; twenty years &#60;ago&#62; I thought of relating its history in verse, in honour of a preparation which in flavour bears witness to its Olympian derivation, &#38; in appearance to the theotaurine vehicle wherein it was committed to the sea-shore.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">In Greek myth, Mount Olympus was the home of the gods; and Zeus was a god who had taken the form a bull (‘theotaurine’).</note> – I was very glad also to see where a letter would find you, – not having for a long time known in what part of this wide world you were to be found. The question was asked of me six or eight months ago by <ref type="m" target="people.html#TicknorGeorge">Ticknor</ref>, who was desirous of writing to you. Tell me where I may tell him to direct, – for at Bath I suppose you are only a bird of passage.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I am at this time employed more continuously upon one thing than is usual with me, that I may the sooner take wing for a longer flight &#38; longer absence than I like to think of, – to London first, – then Devonshire, &#38; to Norwich on my way back. Probably I shall [MS torn]t <del>town</del> &#60;London&#62; about the second week in May,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey did not leave home until 3 November 1823.</note> – <del>which</del> of all times in the year <del>xis</del> that which a lover of the country would with the most reluctance pass in town. <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> is there at present with <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthMary">his wife</ref>, &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#HutchinsonSara">Miss Hutchinson</ref>.

            <p rend="indent1">Since last I saw you my course of life has been <del>xxxx</del> very little varied, – thank Heaven it has been disturbed by no afflictions, which after a certain stage are almost the only variations we have to expect. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</ref> is now a young woman; – <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref> has almost shot up to <del>the</del> an equal stature; – the two other girls<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"><ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyKate">Kate</ref> and <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Isabel Southey</ref>.</note> keeping their due proportion, &#38; so grown out of playthings; &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</ref>, thank God, a fine &#38; thriving boy. For myself I am in better condition than I have been for several years, owing mainly to a course of exercise commenced last summer, &#38; steadily continued till this time. If you ask whether I am “a sadder &#38; a wiser man”,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ‘The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere’, Part 7, line 111, in William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, <title>Lyrical Ballads, with a Few Other Poems</title> (Bristol, 1798), p. 51.</note> the children will answer no, without hesitation; – but I perhaps should hesitate before I replied to the first part of the question. With regard to the second – I hope I shall always be able to say, <hi rend="ital">Anch’ io imparo</hi>.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">‘I too learn’.</note> Your brother<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Kenyon (d. 1856), who lived in Vienna.

I have learnt a little of the Danish during the winter, &#38; in due time shall get at the Teutonic sources of our language, – &#38; of our literature as far as these exist.</p>
               <p rend="indent1">The book which I am now finishing is my long-meditated sketch of English Ecclesiastical History.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> It will provoke obloquy enough I dare say from bigots of every denomination: but I think it will have the effect not indeed of altering any persons opinions, – but of confirming those of many, – &#38; giving many a right bias when they begin their course. In the course of my reading it has been mortifying to observe, with what want of care, &#38; still more with what want of good faith &#38; good feeling this subject has been usually treated.</p>
