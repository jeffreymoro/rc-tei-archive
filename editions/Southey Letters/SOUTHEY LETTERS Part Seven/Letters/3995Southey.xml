<opener><salute>My dear R.</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">Thank you for your letter, – &#38; for your wish to serve <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother</ref> in his views of emigration.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Tom Southey was considering emigrating to Canada.</note> If his credentials from the colonial office arrive in time, he will sail in the course of this week, to take possession of his allotment, &#38; see what will be necessary before he removes his family thither, <del>this time</del> twelvemonths hence. <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> has spoken for him to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Wilmot,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Robert Wilmot-Horton, 3rd Baronet (1784–1841; <title>DNB</title>), Under-Secretary for War and the Colonies 1821–1828 and indefatigable promoter of emigration schemes, especially to Canada. He was later Governor of Ceylon, 1831–1837.</note> – &#38; “every facility’ is promised accordingly. I am well aware that official phrases of this kind mean less than they are sometimes supposed to convey; &#38; perhaps <del>that</del> all that can be done in the regular course of things will be to give him useful letters of introduction – in addition to his grant – which seems to be a thing of course. – I do not see how you can serve him, but if you can, I shall be glad &#38; thankful. But I shall not mention the subject to him, having like you, an unwillingness ever to excite expectations which it may not be possible to fulfil.</p>
               <p rend="indent1">It is a business which presses heavily upon me, – but I am quite satisfied that is the only reasonable course he can pursue. And to such a course I could very well make up my own mind, if I were not in the very situation wherein I can be employed most advantageously.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I have been so closely employed in getting on with what is necessary for my ways &#38; means before I leave home, – that I have not had time to pursue the transcript of my Journal.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>Journal of a Tour in the Netherlands in the Autumn of 1815</title> (1902).</note> I must however soon do so, if it were merely to divert my mind from too long attention to one subject, – which experience has made me fear.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> I am told means to die in harness, – which is a great evil for the QR. I have not heard from him since his illness, – indeed <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> tells me he is confined to his room, if not to his bed. And this accounts for his not answering a question which I asked him a fortnight ago, whether he wished to have a paper from me upon the affairs of Sp. &#38; P.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey did not write on this subject for the <title>Quarterly Review</title>.</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1">I shall not be able to start before next month.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey did not leave for London until 3 November 1823.</note> The increased speed of the mail will save one night upon the road, – which however as far as my personal comfort is concerned is not worth the expense in horse-flesh.</p>
