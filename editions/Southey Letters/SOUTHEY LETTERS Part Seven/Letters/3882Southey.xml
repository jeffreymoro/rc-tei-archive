His accident occurred on 2 August 1822 and was widely reported in the newspapers (without naming him): ‘A young gentleman, by way of saluting some friends who were taking their departure, fired off a cannon, which unfortunately burst in consequence of being overloaded, and the fragments severely fractured his skull’ (<title>Glasgow Herald</title>, 12 August 1822). The cannon was kept outside Peachy’s house on Derwent Island and was fired as part of the annual Keswick Regatta.</note> He is far from being out of danger, – but thus far all appearances are favourable; &#38; should he recover, there is now reason to hope that the eye may be saved. <ref type="m" target="people.html#PeachyMrs">His mother</ref> is full of hope, &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#PeachyWilliam">the General</ref> has begun to think &#38; talk of other things.</p>
