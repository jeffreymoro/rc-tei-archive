            <p rend="indent1">We are in what is sometimes called a mess, sometimes a quandary, concerning <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref>. This morning came intelligence that Miss Tolson<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Tolson (dates unknown). She had set up business in High Holborn, London, as a ‘linen-draper, dealer and chapwoman’. Declared bankrupt on 8 July 1826, she started a new business in Regent Street as a ‘milliner and dress maker’ only to go bankrupt again on 16 May 1828.</note> has put off her journey from Wednesday the 7 till Monday the 12, – &#38; a very great mess or quandary this alteration occasions. For if <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref> goes with her then, when she arrives in London what is to become of her? The Rickmans<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"><ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">John Rickman</ref> and his family.</note> will be out of town, – so will <ref type="m" target="people.html#GonneMrs">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Gonne</ref>, – <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyLouisa">your Aunt Louisa</ref> it is very likely will go with her, &#38; if it were possible to get her to <ref type="m" target="places.html#Streatham">Streatham</ref>, that house also will be without its inhabitants So that the mess seems to be as compleat as it can be. And it is even curiously unlucky, – for had it been a little earlier or a little later, the difference of a few days would have been of no manner of consequence.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">There remains a forlorn hope that a Miss Walmesley of Penrith<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified, but possibly a connection of Roger Walmesley (d. 1812), a wine merchant of Penrith.</note> – bound in like manner to Vanity Fair<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">A term for London, from John Bunyan (1628–1688; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Pilgrim’s Progress</title> (1678), where ‘Vanity Fair’ represented all the sins of earthly life that distracted the Pilgrim on his journey to salvation.</note> upon a mission in the cause of Fashion, may take charge of her, &#38; may be going at the right time. A letter goes by this post to see if this can be arranged, &#38; by tomorrows you shall be informed of the result Meantime the only use of my writing at present (except that of letting you know <del>xx</del> our state of quandaring) is, that you may tell us whether <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyLouisa">your Aunt Louisa</ref> is going out of town, &#38; consequently whether the forlorn Bertha[Southey] can be housed in <ref type="m" target="places.html#QueenAnneSt">Q Anne Street</ref> till you &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanSusannah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Rickman</ref> return: – in case the Penrith scheme should fail, – as I fear it most likely will.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> As for deranging your engagements with Lady Malet<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Lady Susanna Malet, née Wales (1779–1868), the widow of Sir Charles Malet, 1st Baronet (1752–1815; <title>DNB</title>), with whom Edith May Southey was staying in London.</note> that is not to be thought of. Engagements are never to be broken off except in cases of absolute necessity. – If we can send her so that she may arrive as late as the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> we will. But at the worst, the visit can only be put off</p>
            <p rend="indent1">The cold which visits every body has taken up its abode with me, &#38; I am scarcely able to do any thing except blowing my nose</p>

          <p rend="indent1">  We are expecting every day a visit from Wade Browne.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Wade Browne (1796–1851), only son of Wade Browne and later a country gentleman at Monkton Farleigh in Somerset. He had been travelling in the Near East.</note></p></postscript>
