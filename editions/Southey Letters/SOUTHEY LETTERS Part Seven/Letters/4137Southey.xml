        <p rend="indent1">    Among the letters which I have to acknowledge on my return home after a long absence, is yours of Dec 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> </p>
            <p rend="indent1"> I was well acquainted with <ref type="m" target="people.html#GilbertWilliam">the Author</ref> of the Hurricane.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Hurricane: a Theosophical and Western Eclogue</title> (1796).</note> But I should not think myself justified in making public at this time the more prominent incidents of his life, because I believe he has near relations living<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Two of Gilbert’s sisters, Elizabeth Gilbert (1758–1832), and Euphemia Lynch (1755–1835), widow of Thomas Lynch (d. 1788), a doctor in Antigua, were still living in England at this time.</note> to whom such a disclosure would be painful. Suffice it to say that he was educated for the West India Bar,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">William Gilbert became a Counsellor at Law in Antigua in 1783 and was Clerk to the island’s House of Assembly 1783–1786.</note> &#38; came over to this country upon a Court Martial case between the years 1780 &#38; 90, – on the part of the defendant, whose name, (if my recollection does not deceive me) was Browne,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Major John Browne (dates unknown) of the 67th Regiment of Foot had prosecuted a fellow-officer by Court Martial in Antigua, with Gilbert acting as his counsel. The officer was acquitted and went on to prosecute Browne in his turn. The case was heard at a General Court Martial in London in 1787 and Gilbert was able to secure his client’s acquittal.</note> – &#38; his rank, I think, L<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Colonel, – but of this I am not so sure. He published a pamphlett upon the case,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>An Opinion upon the Power of Courts Martial to Punish for Contempts, Occasioned by the Case of Major John Browne, of the Sixty-Seventh Regiment</title> (1788).</note> – &#38; also a poem in praise of M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Siddons, – wherein the Tragic &#38; Comic Muses were represented as contending for her.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Sarah Siddons (1755–1831; <title>DNB</title>), one of the most celebrated actresses of her day. This poem by Gilbert is untraced.</note> <del>Xxx</del> Sir Joshua’s picture of Garrick may have suggested the plan.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723–1792; <title>DNB</title>), ‘David Garrick Between Tragedy and Comedy’ (1761) depicted David Garrick (1712–1779; <title>DNB</title>), the actor, manager and playwright, torn between the Muses of Comedy and Tragedy.</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1">He died about twenty years ago, in good circumstances, having recovered some litigated property.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Gilbert was in fact still alive. He died in Augusta, Georgia, on 30 June 1824.</note> While it was withheld he was a needy man. I need not tell you, what the Hurricane evinces, that he was insane. Of this indeed I could give you curious instances if it were proper to make them public. Should I ever have the pleasure of seeing you here, I will endeavour to find a paper containing his remarks upon the scheme of my nativity,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Gilbert’s horoscope for Southey does not survive, but for an account of it see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 30 September 1797, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part One</title>, Letter 259. </note> – for he was an Astrologer, – as also upon a fragment of his last publication entitled the Standard of God displayed.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">This work was not finished or published.</note></p>
           <p rend="indent1"> He was certainly the most insane person whom I have ever known at large, &#38; his insanity had <del>quenched</del> &#60;smothered&#62; his genius. But that genius when it appeared was of a high order, &#38; he was not more an object of pity than of respect to all who knew him</p>
