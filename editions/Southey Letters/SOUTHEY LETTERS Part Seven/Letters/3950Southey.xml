<salute>My dear friend</salute></opener>
	<p rend="indent1">I send you a long biographical letter<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to John May, 8 January 1823, Letter 3949.</note> – inconveniently interlined &#38; interpolated. However tho unsightly it is not I believe more illegible than usual. The next letter<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to John May, 10–19 January 1823, Letter 3951, though Southey did not discuss his earliest compositions until he wrote to John May on 29 June 1824, Letter 4208.</note> will touch upon my earliest studies &#38; compositions. We have got on very slowly hitherto, &#38; yet some progress has been made, – I am surprized to see how much, in looking at my transcribed copy.</p>
	<p rend="indent1">No news as yet of the strong beer, – but I live in daily hope. </p>
            <p rend="indent1">Our last news of the travellers was that they were to be at Highgate<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"><ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">Sara</ref> and <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Sara Coleridge</ref> were on an extended journey during which they visited <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</ref> at Highgate in January 1823.</note> on New Years Day. – Many happy new years to you &#38; yours.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">We are all going on well, God be thanked. I am working hard at the B of the Church,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> – at my second volume, – &#38; now – <hi rend="ital">pei mihi</hi>!<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">‘oh my!’</note> at reviewing, – as the time comes round. But in the present case I have no right to complain, for taking Gregoires history of the Theophilanthropists<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s review of Henri Grégoire (1750–1831), ‘Histoire de la Théophilantropie, depuis sa Naissance jusqu’à son Extinction’, part of Grégoire’s <title>Histoire des Sectes Religieuse, qui, Depuis de Commencement du Siecle Dernier Jusqu’a l’Epoque Actuelle, sont Nées, se sont Modifiées, se sont Éteintes dans le Quatre Parties du Monde</title>, 2 vols (Paris, 1814), II, pp. 55–171, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 28 (January 1823), 493–536, published 8 July 1823. The book was no. 2838 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. Theophilanthropy was a deistic religion that was particularly prominent in France in 1797–1799.</note> to begin with, I mean to offer some remarks upon infidelity, which I hope may do less discredit to the QR, &#38; prove more useful to those who need it, than the late discourse upon <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">Lord Byron</ref>, which needed nothing but a text to make it read like a dull sermon.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The review of Byron’s <title>Marino Faliero, Doge of Venice. An Historical Tragedy, in Five Acts. With Notes. The Prophecy of Dante, a Poem</title> (1821) and <title>Sardanapulus, A Tragedy. The Two Foscari, A Tragedy, Cain, A Mystery</title> (1821) by Reginald Heber, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 27 (July 1822), 476–524, published 23 October 1822.</note> Your <del>godmoth</del> <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">goddaughter</ref> is busy as a bee, either with head or hands, from morning till night.
