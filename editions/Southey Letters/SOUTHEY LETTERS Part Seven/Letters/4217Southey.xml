          <p rend="indent1">  I do not know when I have received so much pleasure as your last letter gave me. It was the greater indeed, because your silence, – &#38; a hopeless account which reached me in the meantime from another quarter had made me apprehend the worst, &#38; I never opened the newspaper without looking at the deaths in fear of finding what I expected there. Thank God.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">  You shall do as you will here: – &#38; I will broach a barrel of strong beer for you, sent me by <ref type="m" target="people.html#MayJohn">John May</ref> from Hampshire, – but of the Wiltshire breed. It has been more than a year in my cellar, – &#38; it will not disgrace a Stilton cheese, if you should send one as a proper accompaniment.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> I am certainly better, tho the cough has not entirely left me. But I think it is taking its departure.</p>

              <p rend="indent1"> <ref type="m" target="people.html#KiddJohn">Kidd</ref> is a very good fellow: &#38; it was a great disappointment to me that I did not see him at Oxford: – the only pleasure which I looked-on to in that place.</p></postscript>
