            <p rend="indent1">We shall be very glad to see your son with you, &#38; should be more so if we had a bed to offer him.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was visited by John May and his son, John May (1802–1879), for four weeks in August–September 1822.</note> But in all likelihood it will be easy to get him one at the bottom of the garden, – &#38; if not, one of the Inns is within five minutes walk.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The Southeys sometimes put up visitors in a building at the end of the garden at Greta Hall. The two main inns in Keswick were the Royal Oak and the Queen’s Head.</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1">There are two Carlisle mails, &#38; he who takes the wrong one has to spend three hours at midnight in a Manchester Inn, the worst place on this side Purgatory. The right one is that from the <ref type="m" target="places.html#BullandMouth">Bull &#38; Mouth</ref>, which goes thro Doncaster. You must take your place to Penrith, which is 18 miles from hence: &#38; You will be here in 41 hours from London. – When I am once settled in the coach I think nothing of the journey. I should look forward to this meeting with unmingled pleasure if you could come without a load of cares, &#38; if you could make a longer tarriance. As it is I look to it with great delight, &#38; not without hope that things will have brightened by that time (as they are not darkening now) &#38; that you will find your spirits freshened by the visit.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Your God-daughter</ref> goes, I believe, this week to Harrogate. We shall miss her much, – but I am very glad that there is an opportunity of sending her there.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I hope I shall be near the end of my first volume by the time you come.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The first volume of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832). It ran to 806 pages.</note> indeed it is time I should, because of its length, – &#38; there is little but plain sailing before me. – Something it will enable me to place at your disposal – I heartily wish it were more.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> I have a great deal to show you, &#38; a great deal to say –</p>
