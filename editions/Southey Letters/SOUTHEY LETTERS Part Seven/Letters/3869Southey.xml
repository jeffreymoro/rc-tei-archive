I am looking every day to hear from him. Meantime my old college friend <ref type="m" target="people.html#LightfootNicholas">Lightfoot</ref> is with me, whom I had not seen for eight &#38; twenty years. He is now a married man with five children;<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">John Prideaux Lightfoot; Frances Jane Lightfoot (1806–1882), Southey’s god-daughter; Catherine Anne Lightfoot (1808–1898); Bridget Mary Lightfoot (1810–1889); Nicholas Francis Lightfoot (1811–1881), Vicar of Cadbury 1846–1855, Rector of Islip 1855–1881.</note> – his life has been uniform &#38; laborious, but singularly fortunate; he has realized a respectable fortune as a schoolmaster,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Lightfoot had been Master of Queen Elizabeth’s Grammar School, Crediton, since March 1800. Although Lightfoot’s stipend had at first been only £20 p.a., his admission of boarding pupils, and improvements in the schools endowments, gave him a respectable, if not secure, income. In 1818 he received a stipend of £50 as headmaster, plus a house and an allowance for taxes. He was also paid £5 p.a. for each day pupil and charged 30 guineas p.a. for boarding pupils (of whom he had 37 in 1811). In addition, the Governors of the school had presented him to the nearby Rectory of Kennerleigh in 1807, with a stipend of £100 p.a.; Nicholas Carlisle, <title>A Concise Description of the Endowed Grammar Schools in England and Wales</title>, 2 vols (London, 1818), I, pp. 254–265.</note> &#38; during one &#38; twenty years, that he has been married,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Nicholas Lightfoot married Bridget Prideaux (1768–1856) on 13 July 1801.

A happier man I never saw, &#38; no man is more deserving of happiness. He stays here till Tuesday the 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. If <ref type="m" target="people.html#MayJohn">John May</ref> arrives before that time the young John must sleep in the town, otherwise we have so managed matters as to find rooms for father &#38; son.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> One of <ref type="m" target="people.html#TicknorGeorge">my New England friends</ref> has sent me a cargo of Yankee books which I wish you would enquire for because they ought to have reached me before this time.

This is the American direction, &#38; whether Miller live in Fleet Street, or in the Strand I cannot tell but think it is in the former. When you go that way call, &#38; make enquiry concerning them.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> A spell among the mountains will do you good. I was on Skiddaw yesterday, – &#38; am trying whether by persevering in exercise I can, as on former occasion, put my system in such tone as for awhile to suspend my complaint.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably Southey’s rectal prolapse.</note> It annoys me greatly on waking &#38; I have little doubt but that it will effectually lay me up at last, if I live long enough for it to take its course.
