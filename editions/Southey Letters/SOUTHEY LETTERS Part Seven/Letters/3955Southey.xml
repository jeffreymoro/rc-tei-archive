<salute>My dear friend</salute></opener>
	<p rend="indent1">Here is another biographical letter<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to John May, 10–19 January 1823, Letter 3951.</note> for you, following more closely on the last than you have had any reason from experience to expect. The truth is, that looking at the respectable bulk which my transcript of these recollections begins to assume, I feel a little of what the money-lover feels when he regards the accumulation of his wealth, &#38; am <del>xxx</del> encouraged therefore to go on. Moreover as the recollections of my intellectual life are opening upon me, there is an additional interest in proceeding.</p>
	<p rend="indent1">The strong beer is arrived, for which I have sung O be Joyful.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Psalm</title> 100: 1, a great favourite with evangelicals.</note> I have some thoughts of composing an heroic ode thereon, in opposition to the &#7940;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#8021;&#948;&#969;&#961; of Pindar<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Pindar (c. 522–c. 443 BC), <title>Olympian</title> 1, line 1, ‘Water is best’.</note> – which proposition, I think, contains an abominable heresy. Remember that you are to come &#38; drink part of it; – &#38; that sundry things in this neighbourhood have been left unseen.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I have not heard a word from <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> since the publication of my book,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The first volume of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> – &#38; <del>xx</del> very little from other quarters. <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref> sent me yesterday a letter of <ref type="m" target="people.html#AbbotCharles">Lord Colchesters</ref> concerning it, – in the highest terms of praise, – objecting only to what I do not consider objectionable; the full detail of events at Bayonne.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), I, pp. 206–236, detailing how Charles IV (1748–1819; King of Spain 1788–1808) and his son, Ferdinand VII (1784–1833; King of Spain 1808, 1813–1833), were coerced into renouncing their claims on the Spanish throne.</note> I think you will read the Portugueze chapters with interest, these chapters particularly contain such damning proofs of the villainy of the French as must shame <del>xx</del> some of their admirers, if it does not silence them. – I am getting on with the second volume, tho it cannot go to press till <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> gets me some books concerning the war in Catalonia.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had read John Mitford’s ‘On Spanish Literature, with some Account of Francisco de Olivarez’, <title>New Monthly Magazine</title>, 10 (October 1818), 221–223. It mentioned Olivarez’s <title>Account of the War in Catalonia</title> (1815) in four volumes, published at Seville, 1815; <title>Anecdotes of Chiefs Employed in the Catalan War</title> (1816); and <title>Memoirs of the Spanish Monarchy to the Abdication of Charles 4 &#38; the Usurpation of Joseph Bonaparte</title> (1816). However, none of these works seem to exist. Southey had already asked Murray to try and acquire them; see Southey to John Murray: 10 July 1820, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3509; 27 February 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3641; 11 June 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3693; and 27 July 1822, Letter 3877; and 1 November [1822], Letter 3911.</note></p>
	<p rend="indent1">Your good mother<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary May, née Coppendale (1745–1824).</note> I trust is well recovered, tho this weather (if it be as inclement with you as it is here) is trying for the aged &#38; infirm. We have been covered with snow now for nine days – which is very unusual in this valley – </p>
	<p rend="indent1">The Cortes have acted absurdly in requiring an oath from the Q of Portugal.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Charlotte (1775–1830), wife of John VI (1767–1826; King of Portugal 1816–1826). Charlotte was an extreme reactionary and opposed the liberal Constitution to which John VI had agreed in October 1822. After she refused to swear an oath to the new Constitution she was confined to the convent of Ramalhão, near Sintra. As Charlotte was actively involved in politics and took a major part in an attempted coup in 1824, liberals were hardly acting ‘absurdly’ in their suspicions of the Queen.</note> I am afraid their egregious folly with regard to Brazil may in its consequences be injurious to you,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">The new Portuguese Constitution drafted in 1822 was unacceptable to most Brazilians and led directly to Brazil’s declaration of independence on 7 September 1822. Portuguese troops in Brazil fought an ineffective campaign against the pro-independence forces until they were finally defeated in 1824. Some of the most intense fighting was in the north-eastern province of Bahia.</note> – otherwise its evils are likely to be confined to Bahia, &#38; want of money must bring the contest on their part to an end. Neither in Spain or Portugal do I see any thing hopeful in prospect, – nor can I indeed tell what to wish for in either country.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">There had been a liberal revolution in Spain as well as in Portugal in 1820; both countries had adopted constitutions and both were riven by internal conflict.</note> Poor countries, they needed change God knows! but long, very long will it be before they experience any good from the issue, – &#38; the evils of the process are likely to continue much longer than you &#38; I shall live to witness them.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">We are all well at present thank God. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Your God-daughter</ref> busy as a bee &#38; joyous as a lark: the little girls<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"><ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref>, <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Isabel</ref> and <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyKate">Kate Southey</ref>.</note> praying for a continuance of frost that they may not be deprived of their sliding, &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cupn</ref> still determined upon being an Archbishop. They all send their kindest remembrances – present mine to your fireside – &#38; believe me</p>
