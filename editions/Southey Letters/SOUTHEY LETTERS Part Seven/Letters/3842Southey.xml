            <p rend="indent1"> By the time this reaches you I shall be far on the road to Harrogate.

I assure you it is no small exertion to go even for ten days from home in this beautiful season which is worth all the rest of the year.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">If you do not come to me this summer you deserve to be made a cabinet minister: that is – to be belied blackguarded &#38; badgered <del>xx</del> like <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">his Right Honour</ref>. What a quantity of cooling drinks he must require to keep his Welsh blood down when my Saxon pulse rises for him – at the distance of three hundred miles.</p>
