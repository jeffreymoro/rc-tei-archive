   <salute>My dear Edith</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">To-day I thought would have brought me a letter from home, with an acknowledgement of the half bill: probably I shall find it tomorrow on my return to town. And as I have now after six days close work packed up my papers (having finished &#38; sent off the review,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Timothy Dwight (1752–1817), <title>Travels in New-England and New-York</title> (1821–1822), no. 881 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. It was reviewed by Southey in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 30 (October 1823), 1–40, published 17 April 1824.</note> &#38; advanced so near the end of the B. Church<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> that three mornings in <ref type="m" target="places.html#QueenAnneSt">Q Anne Street</ref> will finish that also) – I may with a quiet conscience indulge in writing home.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I am afraid I expressed myself more peevishly than <del>xxx</del> I ought concerning <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> C.s</ref> account with Tolson.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Samuel Tolson, Jnr (1756–1842), a commission agent and tea dealer in Liverpool and the owner of Greta Hall since 1815.</note> You would excuse <del>me</del> it if you knew how many needless &#38; senseless demands are made upon my time in town, where every minute is precious.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I came here on Thursday last. <ref type="m" target="people.html#TaylorHenrySir">Henry Taylor</ref> walked half the way with me, – the letter of introduction which I gave him at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> has proved so efficacious, (which of course it would not have been if his own talents had not accredited it) that he is now Editor of the London Magazine.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Taylor contributed to the <title>London Magazine</title> at this time, but he did not become its editor.</note> – The boys are all at home, <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillErrol ">Errol</ref> <del>xxx</del> brought with him a cold &#38; affection of the chest, in consequence of which <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> came over yesterday to prescribe for him. He appears better to day; but it has altered him a good deal, &#38; kept him in so quiet or rather languid a state that I have scarcely heard his voice, nor seen what kind of boy he is. I believe however that I should like him rather less than <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillEdwardJnr">Edward</ref> &#38; rather more than <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillHerbertJnr">his second brother</ref>, tho they are all fine, promising, well disposed lads. Poor <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillAlfred">Alfred</ref> is the <hi rend="ital">wrecklin</hi><note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">A Cumbrian dialect word for the smallest of the litter; Alfred Hill was Herbert Hill’s second youngest son.</note> of the family, &#38; sorry I am to say that he is as much like a mucken<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Cuthbert Southey’s word for a monkey.</note> as poor Wilber<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> himself. <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillGeorgiana">Georgiana</ref> excels at football, &#38; is the stoutest of the whole, but withal a very fine handsome girl.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">My Uncle</ref> appears to be much the same as when I was last in town. Nothing has failed him but his limbs, &#38; those rather from &#60;the effect&#62; of rheumatism than of age. He goes to London in the stage &#38; returns the same morning, without difficulty or apparent fatigue. His hearing is as good as ever it was; his sight very little impaired, &#38; were it not that the loss of his teeth affects his articulation, his conversation <del>xxx</del> would betray no symptoms of age, for he has the same quiet, chearful, &#38; even playful manner than he had at Lisbon, three &#38; twenty years ago. <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillCatherine">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> H.</ref> is much the graver of the two. She is fatter than when you saw her &#38; looks older than you <del>xxx</del>, as indeed I suppose she is.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Catherine Hill was one year younger than Edith Southey.</note> They keep no company, whatever, which I think must rather be owing to her inclination than his. During the six days that I have been here, the only persons who have called have been <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">the Doctor</ref>: not one of the parishioners. My mornings &#38; evenings have been past up stairs in solitude, steadily at work, <del>xx</del> I have had my afternoon &#60;nap&#62; also, &#38; enjoy dining at four o clock, &#38; a glass of arrack punch<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">A distilled alcoholic drink, made from the fermented sap of the coconut tree, mixed with fruit or fruit juice.</note> after supper</p>
            <p rend="indent1">Tomorrow I mean to receive the sacrament here, &#38; then put myself on the way to London &#38; take my chance for a stage. We dine at <ref type="m" target="people.html#GonneMrs">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Gonnes</ref>, where I shall see <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</ref>. <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">My Uncle</ref> has given me a beautiful little broche for her, – it is an <hi rend="ital">agoe marina</hi><note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">The Portuguese term for aquamarine, a precious stone of a bluish-green colour.</note> very prettily set. Friday we dine at <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedfords</ref>. Saturday with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Monkhouse.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Monkhouse (1783–1825), a London merchant and cousin of Mary Wordsworth. He lived at 67 Gloucester Place, Portman Square, London.</note> My engagements in Devonshire stand thus – Saturday being the day of my arrival there, with the Kennaways,<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir John Kennaway, 1st Baronet (1758–1836), made a fortune in the East India Company and became a landowner in Devonshire. Southey knew him through his son, Charles Edward Kennaway, who had visited Southey in the Lake District in 1819–1820. The Kennaway home, Escot House, is close to Ottery St Mary.</note> – Sunday at Ottery, – Monday &#38; Tuesday with <ref type="m" target="people.html#AclandThomasSir">Sir T Acland</ref> &#38; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Marryat,<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">John Marriott (1780–1825; <title>DNB</title>), a clergyman, poet and friend of Walter Scott. He was Curate of St James, Exeter, St Lawrence, Exeter, and St John, Broadclyst. The patron of the latter church was Sir Thomas Acland, who was also a friend of Marriott.</note> – Wednesday to Exeter &#38; Crediton, where I must take care not to be killed with kindness.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">The inn at Cambridge at which I was quartered is so perfectly clean &#38; commodious that <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</ref> will find no inconvenience in being lodged there for two or three <del>days</del> nights, beyond which our stay would not under any circumstances have been prolonged.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">Poor Dumbee<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">Samuel Lane (1780–1859; <title>DNB</title>). The portrait is now in Balliol College, Oxford.</note> has proved by far the best of all my painters. He took almost an affectionate leave of me, &#38; expressed his regret at not having succeeded better, tho he has in reality satisfied all who have yet seen the picture</p>
            <p rend="indent1">On my return from the West I shall remain no longer in these parts than to make our visit at Richmond. For you may well suppose that I long to be at home. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha’s</ref> letter amused &#38; pleased me much, – &#38; knowing what female curiosity is, I must not blame <del>xx</del> her for prying in a part of the desk where pens are not to be found. Another volume of the German stories<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">Jacob Ludwig Karl Grimm (1785–1863) and Wilhelm Karl Grimm (1786–1859), <title>Kinder-und Hausmärchen</title> (1812), translated as <title>German Popular Stories</title> (1823) by Edgar Taylor (1793–1839; <title>DNB</title>). The book was an immense success (including with Cuthbert Southey) and was reprinted in 1824 and 1825, but a second volume did not appear until 1826.</note> is promised. I wish it may be published while I am in town, that I may send it down in a second frank to <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</ref>. Tell him I am glad to hear he is become so studious. Tell him too that of his three <del>xxx</del> Welsh Uncles here, the eldest is to be Master of Westminster, the second Lord Chancellor, &#38; the third Archbishop of York. I could not consent to his having Canterbury, because Canterbury is engaged. – Oh bless that sweet boy, how I long to see him, &#38; to tell him once more that I am very fond of him.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">You may laugh at <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">your daughter</ref> about Hunter the Savage,<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> of whom she made half a conquest at Montreal.<note n="17" place="foot" resp="editors">The country home of J. C. Herries, near Sevenoaks in Kent.</note> I am almost sorry &#60;to see&#62; the depth &#38; strength of her attachment to home. Now that she is in London, she says, she will stay out the time she had appointed &#38; do all she intended to do, – but she will never go to London again. She dislikes it as heartily as I do. And yet she receives as much kindness as you could desire, &#38; is fully sensible of it. – As for <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> he pronounces her to be the most elegant creature he ever saw. – With regard to drawing I shall follow <ref type="m" target="people.html#WestallWilliam">Westalls</ref> advice whatever that may be, when I can see him again, &#38; as to singing she shall do whatever is thought advisable &#38; <del>acxxds</del> &#60;accords&#62; with her own wishes.</p>
