            <p rend="indent1">I heartily wish the newspaper account of me were true where it is false, &#38; false where it is true, – for I am going to London &#38; have no poem to take in my pocket.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">‘Southey is expected very shortly in London, with a new poem, the hero of which is a Quaker’ (<title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 24 April 1823). This was a reference to Southey’s unfinished epic, ‘Oliver Newman’, set in New England. A fragment was published posthumously in <title>Oliver Newman: a New-England Tale (Unfinished): with Other Poetical Remains by the Late Robert Southey</title> (London, 1845), pp. 1–90. </note> My departure will not be as soon as I wish, because a book must first be compleated which I had hoped &#38; expected ere this to have sent you, but which has grown under my hands into to a second volume.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> – I have to visit at wide intervals of place, – Devonshire &#38; <ref type="m" target="places.html#Norwich">Norwich</ref>, but they must be flying visits. My whole absence must not exceed two months, – &#38; if you come in August instead of July, I will be home by the middle of that month.</p>
               <p rend="indent1">You have not been well informed concerning this climate. The best season for our Lakes &#38; Mountains is that which is now beginning, or rather which has just begun. May &#38; June are to be preferred to all the other months. July &#38; August are more likely to be wet, in September the weather generally becomes fine again, &#38; would be as delightful as the spring, if the days were not shortening, &#38; did not sometimes bring with them premature indications of winter, – which I have known here to begin before Michaelmas<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">29 September.</note> &#38; at other times nor to begin till after Christmas. But for the most part autumn lingers with us &#38; is drier than the summer.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">The best thing <del>that</del> I can say of the lodgings is that they are when farthest from this house within ten minutes walk of it, &#38; some not half the distance. Let me know when you can fix the time, &#38; I will take care they shall be provided. A letter to <ref type="m" target="places.html#QueenAnneSt">15 Q Anne Street, Cavendish Square</ref> will find me wherever I may be on my circuit. Indeed you must tell me your direction when you reach Leamington, that I may send my Book of the Church thither. It ought to be an impressive book, for nothing can exceed the interest of the subject, in many parts. </p>
            <p rend="indent1">You will enjoy this country, &#38; I trust it may materially contribute to reestablish your health. <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">One of my most intimate friends</ref> had an affection of the liver some ten years ago, which baffled the best medical aid in London, &#38; his physician afterwards confessed that he ordered him here, in the belief that he would never return.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">See Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 8 July 1810, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Four</title>, Letter 1791.</note> His looks when he arrived gave me the greatest shock of that kind I ever experienced. In six weeks however he returned home perfectly well, &#38; has ever since continued a sound man. And this can be attributed to no other cause than the mountain air which he delighted in, &#38; enjoyed heartily during his stay.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">My wife</ref> &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">eldest daughter</ref> are delighted with the thought of seeing you. There is nothing tremendous in the journey – when it is once begun. I shall have some things to shew you, &#38; a great deal to say. You will go home with a <del>xxxxxxxxx</del> book full of sketches, – a mind full of imagery drawn from these waters &#38; mountains, &#38; a heart full of poetry.</p>

   You shall see my correspondence with <ref type="m" target="people.html#ShelleyPercyBysshe">Shelley</ref> when you are here.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">In a letter of 26 June 1820, Shelley had accused Southey of writing a hostile review of <title>Laon and Cythna, or the Revolution of the Golden City</title> (1817; published late 1818) and <title>The Revolt of Islam. A Poem, in Twelve Cantos</title> (1818); see Edward Dowden (ed.), <title>The Correspondence of Robert Southey with Caroline Bowles</title> (Dublin and London, 1881), pp. 358–359. Southey responded with his letter to Percy Bysshe Shelley, [c. 29 July 1820], <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3517. Shelley replied in a letter to Southey, 17 August 1820, Edward Dowden (ed.), <title>The Correspondence of Robert Southey with Caroline Bowles</title> (Dublin and London, 1881), pp. 361–363. A letter from Southey to Percy Bysshe Shelley, 12 October 1820, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3538, closed the correspondence.</note> – When I spoke of him in a former letter it was as having been here ten years ago, not two.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to Caroline Bowles, 7 July 1822, Letter 3866. Shelley had stayed in Keswick from November 1811 to February 1812, shortly after his marriage to Harriet Westbrook.</note> It was in 1812 that he came to <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>, just after his first marriage.</p></postscript>
