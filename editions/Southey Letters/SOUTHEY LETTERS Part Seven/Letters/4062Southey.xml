            <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#TaylorHenrySir">A young friend of mine, &#38; namesake of yours</ref>, is trying his fortune in the literary world, &#38; I take the liberty of introducing him to you. He has obtained access to the Quarterly Review,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Quarterly Review</title>, 28 (October 1822), 139–144, published 15 February 1823, where Henry Taylor reviewed Thomas Moore (1779–1852; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Irish Melodies</title> (1822).</note> &#38; this alone would prove his qualifications. I believe that he is very capable of doing himself credit in this way of life, &#38; if you should find his productions deserving a place in your Magazine,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Taylor published the <title>London Magazine</title> (1821–1829).</note> you will by <del>xxxxxxxx</del> &#60;admitting them&#62; confer a service upon one who to be esteemed needs only to be known, &#38; a favour upon myself – </p>
