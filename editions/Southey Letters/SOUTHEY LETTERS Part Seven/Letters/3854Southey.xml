               I have troubled you with a small packet, by <ref type="m" target="people.html#CalvertWilliam">Calvert</ref>. Some good foolish woman<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> troubled with me it; it contains bad verses by a poor woman<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> whom she wishes to save from parish pay; – but all my charity in this case can do is to return them to her without putting the Lady to the expence of six shillings in carriage. If they are not too bulky make them into a packet for the 2<hi rend="sup">dy</hi> post: but if they are, let your servant carry them when next he goes into the city, &#38; set down the trouble to your charitable account. I have many plagues of this kind.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> It is very fortunate that <ref type="m" target="people.html#MayJohn">John May</ref> postponed his visit from June till July.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">John May and his son, John May (1802–1879), visited Southey at Keswick 5 August–2 September 1822.</note> I have been very unwell. My cold has been more severe than I ever remember it to have been &#38; at length produced cough &#38; fever. I am now better <del>xxx</del> &#38; recovering strength tho I do not yet venture upon meat &#38; wine. Today the glass promises rain, – a change which be hardly less agreable to me than to the garden –</p>
