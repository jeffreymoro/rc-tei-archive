           <p rend="indent1"> I have no intention of doing any thing more to the B of the Church,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The second edition of Southey’s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824); Murray had already sent this to the press.</note> than what the inclosed paper will enable the printer to perform: – that is, to correct a slip of the pen &#38; a slip of the press; &#38; to omit a circumstance – which I learn from some newspaper critic has been disproved in <del>that</del> a volume of Lingards which I have not seen.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">These corrections were for a second edition of <title>The Book of the Church</title>. The ‘slip of the pen’ occurred in vol. II, p. 8 of the first edition (2 vols, London, 1824), where Charles V (1500–1558; Holy Roman Emperor 1519–1556, King of Spain 1516–1556) was misidentified as the brother, rather than the nephew, of Catherine of Aragon (1485–1536; <title>DNB</title>), first wife of Henry VIII (1491–1547; King of England 1509–1547; <title>DNB</title>). The ‘slip of the press’ occurred in vol. II, p. 341, where Henry IV (1553–1610; King of France 1589–1610) was misprinted for Henry III (1551–1589; King of France 1574–1589). The error was pointed out in the <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 6 February 1824, which contained a letter from ‘TRUTH’, showing that Southey’s account of the death of Stephen Gardiner (1483–1555; <title>DNB</title>), Bishop of Winchester 1531–1551, 1553–1555 in vol. II, pp. 209–210, could not be accurate and was contradicted by John Lingard (1771–1851; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The History of England, from the First Invasion of the Romans</title>, 5 vols (London, 1819–1823), V, p. 628. Southey only possessed the first three volumes of the latter, published in 1819, no. 1634 in the sale catalogue of his library. </note></p>
            <p rend="indent1">Having now fairly lost all hope of obtaining the Spanish book which has been sought thro so many channels,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had read John Mitford’s ‘On Spanish Literature, with some Account of Francisco de Olivarez’, <title>New Monthly Magazine</title>, 10 (October 1818), 221–223. It mentioned Olivarez’s <title>Account of the War in Catalonia</title>, published in four volumes at Seville in 1815; <title>Anecdotes of Chiefs Employed in the Catalan War</title> (1816); and <title>Memoirs of the Spanish Monarchy to the Abdication of Charles 4 &#38; the Usurpation of Joseph Bonaparte</title> (1816). However, none of these works seem to exist. Southey had already asked Murray to try and acquire them; see Southey to John Murray: 10 July 1820, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3509; 27 February 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3641; 11 June 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3693; and 27 July 1822, Letter 3877 and 1 November [1822], Letter 3911. Murray had then written to Spain to try and obtain these books for Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832), and Herbert Hill had also offered to help. Southey had then sought the assistance of George Canning. Finally, Southey had written to John Mitford, 12 April 1824, Letter 4171.</note> I shall pursue my way without it, &#38; put the second volume to press without delay.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The second volume of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> I shall send you a portion of copy in the course of the ensuing week. Please to send me a book which Kolly has published concerning his attempt to deliver Ferdinand,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Leopold, Baron de Kolli (1757–1825), <title>Memoirs of Baron de Kolli, Relative to his Secret Mission in 1810, for Liberating Ferdinand VII, King of Spain, from Captivity at Valencay</title> (1823). This recounted de Kolli’s inept attempt to free Ferdinand VII (1784–1833; King of Spain 1808, 1813–1833) from captivity in France.</note> &#38; Col Stuarts book about the Highland Regiments,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">David Stewart (1772–1829; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Sketches of the Character, Manners and Present State of the Highlanders of Scotland: with Details of the Military Service of the Highland Regiments</title> (1822).</note> – in which there will no doubt be many anecdotes relating to this war. You should let me see too the modern books about Spain by Quin, Bramsen, Count Pecchio,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Michael Joseph Quin (1796–1843; <title>DNB</title>), <title>A Visit to Spain; Detailing the Transactions which Occurred during a Residence in that Country in the Latter Part of 1822, and the First Four Months of 1823. With an Account of the Removal of the Court from Madrid to Seville; and General Notices of the Manners, Customs, Costume and Music of the Country</title> (1823); John Bramsen (1761–1832), <title>Remarks on the North of Spain</title> (1823), no. 130 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library; and Giuseppe, Count Pecchio (1785–1835), <title>Anecdotes of the Spanish and Portuguese Revolutions</title> (1823). Written by travellers to Spain, all three accounts reflected on the revolution in that country in 1820, which had restored the liberal Constitution of 1812.</note> &#38; any others which may have appeared, because tho their object is to treat of the recent revolutions they relate to <hi rend="ital">persons</hi> who figured in my subject, &#38; may in all likelihood afford information which I shall find useful.</p>
          <p rend="indent1">  You shall have a paper upon Hayleys Life for your next number,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s review of John Johnson (1769–1833; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Memoirs of the Life and Writings of William Hayley, Esq. the Friend and Biographer of Cowper, Written by Himself; with Extracts from his Private Correspondence, and Unpublished Poetry; and Memoirs of his Son Thomas Alphonso Hayley, the Young Sculptor</title> (1823), no. 1179 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 31 (March 1825), 263–311.</note> – the subject will include a view of <del>the</del> &#60;our&#62; literary history from commencement of his career – to the end of the last century.
