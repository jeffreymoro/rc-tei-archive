            <salute>Dear Sir</salute></opener>
           <p rend="indent1"> I lose no time in inclosing you a note, which I trust will facilitate your views at Cambridge. But I will venture to say, you will find more liberality there in these matters than you seem to expect.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> The best way of approaching the Lakes is certainly by crossing the sands from <del>Ulverstone</del> Lancaster, – take the stage for this, as the only safe mode. Your directions are as good as can be given. When you reach Ambleside, call on <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Mr Wordsworth</ref> who lives a mile off, – this letter will serve you as an introduction, I should then advise you to see Grasmere under his directions, &#38; proceed to <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> across the Stake, instead of taking the high road, by which means you will see Langdale &#38; Borrodale. Leathes water which you will miss by taking this route, may be seen together with the vale of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Johns by an easy morning’s walk <del>xx</del> from hence; – from hence you will visit Buttermere, Crummock, Ennerdale &#38; Waswater, on the one side, – &#38; Ullswater on your way to Scotland: but here I shall see you &#38; give you more particular directions.</p>
          <p rend="indent1">  I write in haste rather than lose a post –</p>

               <salute rend="indent2">Yours faithfully</salute>
