           <p rend="indent1"> I the Pa received your letter yesterday morning, &#38; as you may like to know the course of my proceedings I take the hour between our return from Oldridge Chapel,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Oldridge Chapel was a chapel of ease of St Thomas, Exeter. Nicholas Lightfoot was the Curate.</note> &#38; our going to Crediton Church, to send you a bulletin.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> After a journey with no discomfort &#38; only one misadventure, I was landed at the Kennaways<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir John Kennaway, 1st Baronet (1758–1836), who made a fortune in the East India Company and became a landowner in Devonshire. Southey knew him through his son, Charles Edward Kennaway, who had visited Southey in the Lake District in 1819–1820.</note> door at one o clock. The misadventure consisted in overturning a market cart, with a woman &#38; two men in it. The tilt saved them from any harm, but I suppose the butter &#38; eggs suffered, &#38; they were in such a rage that they would not suffer us to give them any assistance, so we left them in the road, vowing vengeance. It afterwards appeared that their anger was increased by an unlucky mistake of the Guards, who in the half morning twilight thinking to help the woman out from under the tilt by her arm, took hold of her knee. It is supposed there will be a law suit about it; but I believe they were to blame for keeping directly in the middle of the road, &#38; not drawing on one side when they saw us coming.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> Sir John Kennaway doses his guests &#38; his servants with family worship, of which too much is worse than none. He edified <ref type="m" target="people.html#CoplestonEdward">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Copplestone</ref> as well as myself on the Sunday evening by reading a sermon &#38; a long prayer after it; &#38; with equal want of judgement he made his two little girls<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably Sir John Kennaway’s two youngest (of five) daughters: Augusta Kennaway (1810–1895) and Susan Kennaway (1812–1890), who married, in 1841, Gerard Thomas Noel (1782–1851; <title>DNB</title>), a clergyman and hymn writer.</note> (nice creatures they are,) – show off by repeating verses &#38; extracts from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Irving.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Washington Irving (1783–1859), <title>The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.</title> (1820).</note> They are about the size of <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyKate">Kate</ref> &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Bel</ref>, &#38; waltzed together very prettily.
