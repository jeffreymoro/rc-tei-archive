					<l>"To death devote!" Thus in the vernal bloom</l>
					<l>Of redolent Youth and Beauty, on the Cross</l>
					<l>Hung high her Motto; <note n="38" place="foot" resp="Dodd">Miss Mary Bosanquet, whose motto, encircling a cross, is "Devoted to
							Death." From fourteen years of age she dedicated herself to sincere religion, and to the present hour has persevered in
							the most exemplary line of duty. Her letters to the author, in his last distress, afforded him peculiar comfort.</note>
						--She, in Name, and choice</l>
					<l>Of that far better part, like Her so fam'd</l>
					<l>In story evangelical!--Sweet Saint,</l>
					<l>Friend of my Soul, and soother of my Grief!</l>
					<l>Shall I then dread in age, and worn with woe,</l>
					<l>To meet the King of Terrors?--Coward Fear</l>
					<l>Of what we all must meet: The primal curse</l>
					<l>Of our first Father rests on all his Race,</l>
					<l>And "Dust to Dust," the Charter of Mankind!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1">But, were it possible, oh! who would wish</l>
					<l>To stretch the narrow span, grown tedious, stale,</l>
					<l>With dull recurrence of the same dull acts,</l>
					<l>Ev'n in its happiest state! A toilsome care,</l>
					<l>A wearying round of Clothing, Food, and Sleep:</l>
					<l>While chequer'd over with a thousand ills</l>
					<l>Inevitably painful!--In our Frame</l>
					<l>Dwell, Death's Artillery, diseases dire,</l>
					<l>And potent to dislodge the brittle Life</l>
					<l>With agonies Heart-rending! In the Soul</l>
					<l>Lurks Sin, the serpent, with her fiery sting</l>
					<l>Of sorrow, rankling in the Conscience deep,</l>
					<l>Source of all mental misery!--From without,</l>
					<l>In close battalion, a black troop of ills</l>
					<l>Level their deep-drawn Arrows at our peace;</l>
					<l>And fail not, as we pass thro' Life's bad Road,</l>
					<l>To wound th' unguarded Traveller! Witness You</l>
					<l>Who groan distress'd beneath Oppression's scourge;</l>
					<l>Ingratitude's sharp Tooth; the canker'd Tongue</l>
					<l>Of Slander; Fortune's loss; or, bitterer far,</l>
					<l>The loss of Fame, and soul-connected Friends!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1">Thus tax'd, thus wretched, can the Man be wise,</l>
					<l>Who wishes to retain so poor a Boon?</l>
					<l>Who fears to render the deposit up</l>
					<l>To his blest Hands who gave it? And who thus</l>
					<l>Beneficent hath rang'd his moral plan,</l>
					<l>Thus good with evil mix'd; from Earth's poor Love,</l>
					<l>(School of probation!) suffering Man to wean,</l>
					<l>And raise his hopes to Heaven! Silence then</l>
					<l>The whisper of Complaint; low in the dust</l>
					<l>Dissatisfaction's Daemons growl unheard!</l>
					<l>All, all is good, all excellent below:</l>
					<l>Pain is a blessing; sorrow leads to joy,</l>
					<l>Joy permanent and solid! Every ill</l>
					<l>Bears with its love paternal: Nay, ev'n Death,</l>
					<l>Grim Death itself, in all its horrors clad,</l>
					<l>Is Man's supremest privilege! It frees </l>
					<l>The Soul from Prison, from foul sin, from Woe,</l>
					<l>And gives it back to Glory, Rest, and God!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1">When will its welcome message lay at peace</l>
					<l>My burden'd, beating Heart?--Oh strange! to point</l>
					<l>Thy Darts, inexorable Tyrant, there,</l>
					<l>Where Life laughs crown'd with roses; when these arms,</l>
					<l>Familiar to thy Sister Sorrow's fold,</l>
					<l>Would so delighted hug thee! But thou lov'st</l>
					<l>Full oft the noblest quarry, highest aim:</l>
					<l>Lov'st, unsuspected, and with silent step,</l>
					<l>To steal on the secure: Lov'st to deal round</l>
					<l>Tremendous and impartial thy stern strokes,</l>
					<l>Asserting terrible o'er human-kind</l>
					<l>Thy empire irresistible: And now</l>
					<l>At Monarchs, now at Mimicks, grinning scorn,</l>
					<l>Thy Hand indifferent hurls the twanging Shaft.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1">Ah what a groupe of primest Deer lie pierc'd,</l>
					<l>Thou Hunter all-victorious, at thy feet;</l>
					<l>Since to thy Empire dedicate I fell</l>
					<l>From Life's bright Hope, and languish'd in this Grave,</l>
					<l>This living, doleful Sepulchre immur'd!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1">Not all thy Gold or orient Pearl could save</l>
					<l>Thee, Lusitania's Monarch, from the stroke</l>
					<l>Impending long and dread! Nor, Terrick, <note n="39" place="foot" resp="Dodd">Bishop of London.</note> thee,</l>
					<l>Thy Mitre and thy Rochet! Ensigns blest,</l>
					<l>When worn with sanctity; then surely chang'd</l>
					<l>For Crown of Gold, and Robe of spotless white!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1">See, neither can the Coronet, nor Garb</l>
					<l>Of ermin'd pomp, from Temple <note n="40" place="foot" resp="Dodd">Countess of Temple</note> turn aside</l>
					<l>The level'd Blow; nor, higher far in price,</l>
					<l>Th' uplifted shield of Janssen's honest Heart!</l>
					<l>Lo! too, as if in scorn of purpled pride,</l>
					<l>And all Life's glories, in this high parade</l>
					<l>Funereal marches, tragic-Actor now,</l>
					<l>He who so late light on the comic sock</l>
					<l>Trod the gay stage; and bade with Laughter's burst</l>
					<l>Involuntary the throng'd Theatres resound!</l>
					<l>Ah, food for worms, poor Woodward thou, no less</l>
					<l>Than Patriots, Princes, Countesses and Priests!</l>
					<l>Death scorns distinctions: But, despotic power,</l>
					<l>Cloth'd in his direst terrors, Here he reigns,</l>
					<l>Here revels! Here, with bitterest vengeance, shakes</l>
					<l>O'er trembling Convicts his determin'd shaft,</l>
					<l>And gluts himself with horror! See him lead</l>
					<l>From yonder darksome Cell, all pale with woe,</l>
					<l>That Stranger <note n="41" place="foot" resp="Dodd">Alluding to Tolosa, a poor unhappy Spaniard, lately executed for the murder
							of his Female Friend. He took scarce any sustenance from the time of the fact, and was more than half dead when conveyed
							to the place of execution.</note> sinking! who, in luckless hour,</l>
					<l>With rash Hand pierc'd the bosom he adored,</l>
					<l>Nor drank of comfort more! Half in his Heart</l>
					<l>The black lance festering sticks; and Death himself,</l>
					<l>Howe'er relentless, ere he drives it home,</l>
					<l>Of strange commiseration feels a pang,</l>
					<l>Reluctant to his office!--</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent3"> But, that shriek--</l>
					<l>Thrilling with dread--whence is it? 'Tis the voice</l>
					<l>Of female misery: Bursting thro' the crowd</l>
					<l>To the lone Dungeon, view that lovely form, <note n="42" place="foot" resp="Dodd">This also alludes to a miserable catastrophe,
							which happened here on the morning of a late execution. The poor young Woman who came to visit her Husband, had lain-in
							but seven Days. As soon as the husband's fetters were knocked off, he stepped aside, and cut his throat in a dismal
							manner; but not quite sufficiently to finish his existence:--And in that shocking state--paid his debt--at the destined
							place!</note>
</l>
					<l>Deck'd in the neatest white,--yet not so white</l>
					<l>And wan as her wild visage: "Keep me not,"</l>
					<l>Raving she cries, "Keep me not, cruel! from him.</l>
					<l>"He dies this morn; I know it: He's condemn'd;</l>
					<l>"The dreadful Judge has done it! He must die,</l>
					<l>"My Husband! and I'm come, clad in my best,</l>
					<l>"To go and suffer with him! I have brought</l>
					<l>"Sweet flowers to cheer him, and to strew his corse,</l>
					<l>"Pale, pale, and speechless lies it!--Husband, come!</l>
					<l>"The little infant, fruit of our glad loves,</l>
					<l>"Smil'd on me, as with parting breath I blest,</l>
					<l>"And kiss'd the dear babe for thee! 'Tis but young;</l>
					<l>"'Tis tender yet;--seven days is young in life:</l>
					<l>"Angels will guard my little innocent:</l>
					<l>"They'll feed it, tho' thou could'st not find it food,</l>
					<l>"And its poor Mother too!--And so thou dy'st!</l>
					<l>"For me and it thou dy'st! But not alone,</l>
					<l>"Thou shalt not go alone; I will die with thee:</l>
					<l>"Sweet Mercy be upon us: Hence, hence, hence!"</l>
					<l>Impetuous then, her white arms round his neck</l>
					<l>She threw; and, with deep groans would pierce a rock,</l>
					<l>Sunk fainting: Oh the Husband's, Father's pangs,</l>
					<l>Stopping all utterance! Up to Heaven he roll'd</l>
					<l>His frantic eyes; and staring wildly round</l>
					<l>In desperation's madness, to his heart</l>
					<l>Drove the destructive steel!--Fell Death,</l>
					<l>Would'st thou a fuller triumph?--Oh my Wife,</l>
					<l>How dismal to our ears the shrieks, the groans!--</l>
					<l>And what a crowd of wild ideas press</l>
					<l>Distracting on the soul! "Merciful Heaven,</l>
					<l>"In pity spare us! Say, It is enough,</l>
					<l>"And bid the avenging Angel stay his hand!"</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1">Death bars the plea; and with his thundering stalk</l>
					<l>Brushing beside us, calls, in solemn sound,</l>
					<l>Heed to his dart grief-pointed. Its keen stroke,</l>
					<l>Ah, gentle Eleonora! <note n="43" place="foot" resp="Dodd">Mrs. Dodd's sister; who, in the midst of our sorrows, did--what she
							never did before--augment them, by dying of a heart broken with grief for our calamity. Oh misery!</note> gives at
						once</l>
					<l>Relief to thy o'er-burden'd breast! to ours</l>
					<l>Anguish unutterable! 'Tis ours he wounds,</l>
					<l>Thou amiable friend!--whose languid eye</l>
					<l>Ne'er rais'd a look from earth, since that sad hour,</l>
					<l>When sunk my sun! Thou, who from earliest youth</l>
					<l>Hast humbly sought thy God, thou art at peace:</l>
					<l>Happy, thrice happy, on that golden shore,</l>
					<l>Where from the tossing of these troublous waves</l>
					<l>We soon shall land. Oh stay, Affectionate,</l>
					<l>Oh wait, and welcome us! Or, if in Heaven</l>
					<l>Blest saints retain concern for those on earth</l>
					<l>Held in the dearest amity, become</l>
					<l>Thy darling sister's Guardian! As from youth,</l>
					<l>From childhood's dawn, her dear maternal guide,</l>
					<l>Be now, lov'd Spirit, in this hour of woe,</l>
					<l>Her Angel-comfort, her support! Alas,</l>
					<l>What talk I of support! thou Mercy's God!</l>
					<l>When all her conduct, by thy grace inspir'd--</l>
					<l>When all her patient gentleness and love,</l>
					<l>Her fortitude unparallel'd, and peace,</l>
					<l>Have Thee their Author: Be the glory Thine!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1">But say, my soul, 'midst these alarming calls,</l>
					<l>This dread familiarity with Death;</l>
					<l>Our common debt, from infancy's first cry</l>
					<l>Denounc'd, expected, tho' its sure approach</l>
					<l>Lurks in Uncertainty's obscurest night;--</l>
					<l>Our common debt, which Babes and palsied Seers,</l>
					<l>Princes and pilgrims, equally must pay;--</l>
					<l>Say, canst thou feel reluctance to discharge</l>
					<l>The claim inevitable? Senseless he,</l>
					<l>Who in Life's gaudiest moments fondly strives</l>
					<l>To turn his eyes unheeding from the view</l>
					<l>Instructive. 'Midst those moments, deep it dwelt,</l>
					<l>On my reflecting mind! <note n="44" place="foot" resp="Dodd">Reflections on Death--Thoughts on Epiphany--Sermon on Mutual
							Knowledge, &amp;c.</note> a mind which liv'd</l>
					<l>More in the future than the present world;</l>
					<l>Which, frequent call'd by Duty's solemn voice</l>
					<l>From Earth's low scenes, on those sublimer far</l>
					<l>Hath ever thought delighted; and those thoughts</l>
					<l>Conveying to mankind, in them desires</l>
					<l>Its real transcript, its resemblance true</l>
					<l>May be survey'd--the Picture of itself.</l>
					<l>For, whatsoe'er may be our earthly State,</l>
					<l>The Mind's the Man. My humble labours, then,</l>
					<l>When rests my part corporeal in the dust,</l>
					<l>Hang up my living portrait!--And to give</l>
					<l>Those labours all their force, summon'd I stand</l>
					<l>By awful Providence, to realize</l>
					<l>The theoretic Lessons I have taught.</l>
					<l>And lo! compos'd, I fix my dying seal</l>
					<l>In attestation to their Truth, their Power,</l>
					<l>Felt at my heart, my inmost conscience felt;</l>
					<l>Imparting triumph o'er Life's Love; o'er Death</l>
					<l>Consummate exultation! while my soul</l>
					<l>Longs to go forth, and pants for endless day!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1">But who can wonder, that amidst the woes,</l>
					<l>Like a swoln torrent, which with frightful roar</l>
					<l>Have burst destructive o'er me; midst the loss</l>
					<l>Of all things dear, Fame, Honour, Peace, and Rest;</l>

					<l>To listen to his Lore! to seek for Bliss</l>
					<l>In God, in Piety; in hearts devote</l>
					<l>To Duty and to Heav'n! And seeking thus,</l>
					<l>The Treasure is your own. Angels on earth,</l>
					<l>Thus pure and good, soon will ye mount, and live</l>
					<l>Eternal Angels with your Father--God!</l>

				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1">Of admonition due, just self-contempt,</l>
					<l>And frank Expostulation's honest charge,</l>
					<l>The needful Debt thus paid; haste thou, my Song,</l>
					<l>As hastes my life,--brief shadow,--to its close!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1">Then farewell, oh my Friends, most valued! bound</l>
					<l>By Consanguinity's endearing tye,</l>
					<l>Or Friendship's noble service, manly love,</l>
					<l>And generous obligations! See, in All</l>
					<l>--And spare the Tear of Pity--Heaven's high Will</l>
					<l>Ordaining wise and good. I see, I own</l>
					<l>His dispensation, howsoever harsh,</l>
					<l>To my hard Heart, to my rebellious Soul</l>
					<l>Needful and salutary! His dread Rod</l>
					<l>Paternal, lo I kiss! and to the stroke</l>
					<l>Severe, submissive, thankfully resign! </l>
					<l>It weans me from the World; it proves how vain,</l>
					<l>How poor the Life of erring Man!--hath taught,</l>
					<l>Experimentally hath taught, to look</l>
					<l>With Scorn, with Triumph upon Death;--to wish</l>
					<l>The moment come!--Oh were that moment come,</l>
					<l>When, launch'd from all that's sinful here below,</l>
					<l>Securely I shall sail along the Tide</l>
					<l>Of glorious Eternity! My friends,</l>
					<l>Belov'd and honour'd, Oh that we were launch'd,</l>
					<l>And sailing happy there, where shortly all</l>
					<l>Must one day sail! Oh that in peaceful Port</l>
					<l>We all were landed! all together safe</l>
					<l>In everlasting Amity and Love,</l>
					<l>With God, our God; our Pilot thro' the Storms</l>
					<l>Of this Life's Sea!--But, why the frivolous wish?</l>
					<l>Set a few Suns,--a few more days decline;</l>
					<l>And I shall meet you,--oh the gladsome hour!</l>
					<l>Meet you in Glory,--nor with flowing tears</l>
					<l>Afflicted drop my Pen, and sigh, Adieu!</l>
