				<lg type="stanza">
					<l>Vain are thy generous efforts, worthy Bull, <note n="11" place="foot" resp="Dodd">Frederick Bull, Esq. Alderman of London; to
							whose kindness and humanity the Author has expressed the highest obligations.</note>
</l>
					<l>Thy kind compassion's vain! The hour is come:</l>
					<l>Stern Fate demands compliance: I must pass</l>
					<l>Thro' various deaths, keen torturing, to arrive</l>
					<l>At That my heart so fervently implores;</l>
					<l>Yet fruitless. Ah! why hides He his fell Front</l>
					<l>From woe, from wretchedness, that with glad smiles</l>
					<l>Would welcome his approach; and Tyrant-like,</l>
					<l>Delights to dash the jocund roseate cup</l>
					<l>From the full hand of gaudy Luxury,</l>
					<l>And unsuspecting Ease!--Far worse than Death</l>
					<l>That Prison's Entrance, whose Idea chills</l>
					<l>With freezing horror all my curdling blood;</l>
					<l>Whose very Name, stamping with infamy,</l>
					<l>Makes my Soul frighted start, in frenzy whirl'd,</l>
					<l>And verging near to Madness! See, they ope</l>
					<l>Their iron Jaws! See, the vast Gates expand,</l>
					<l>Gate after Gate--and in an instant twang,</l>
					<l>Clos'd by their growling Keepers:--When again,</l>
					<l>Mysterious Powers!--oh when to open on me?</l>
					<l>Mercy, sweet Heaven! Support my faltering steps,</l>
					<l>Support my sickening heart! My full eyes swim;</l>
					<l>O'er all my frame distils a cold damp sweat.</l>
					<l>Hark--what a rattling din! On every side</l>
					<l>The congregated chains clank frightful:--Throngs</l>
					<l>Tumultuous press around, to view, to gaze</l>
					<l>Upon the wretched stranger; scarce believ'd</l>
					<l>Other than a Visitor within such walls,</l>
					<l>With Mercy, and with Freedom in his hands.</l>
					<l>Alas, how chang'd!--Sons of Confinement, see</l>
					<l>No pitying Deliverer; but a Wretch</l>
					<l>O'erwelm'd with Misery; more hapless far</l>
					<l>Than the most hapless 'mongst ye; loaded hard</l>
					<l>With Guilt's oppressive Irons! His are chains</l>
					<l>No time can loosen, and no hand unbind:</l>
					<l>Fetters, which gore the Soul. Oh Horror, Horror!</l>
					<l>Ye massive bolts, give way! Ye sullen doors,</l>
					<l>Ah, open quick! and from this clamorous rout,</l>
					<l>Close in my dismal, lone, allotted room</l>
					<l>Shrowd me;--for ever shrowd from human sight,</l>
					<l>And make it, if 'tis possible, my Grave!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1"> How truly welcome, then! Then would I greet</l>
					<l>With hallow'd joy the drear, but blest abode;</l>
					<l>And deem it far the happiest I have known,</l>
					<l>The best I e'er inhabited. But, alas!</l>
					<l>There's no such mercy for me. I must run</l>
					<l>Misery's extremest round; and this must be</l>
					<l>Awhile my living grave! the doleful tomb,</l>
					<l>Sad sounding with my unremitted groans,</l>
					<l>And moisten'd with the bitterness of tears!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l rendition="#indent1">Ah, mournful dwelling! destin'd ne'er to see</l>
					<l>The human face divine in placid smiles,</l>
					<l>And innocent gladness cloth'd: destin'd to hear</l>
					<l>No sounds of genial, heart-reviving Joy!</l>
					<l>The Sons of Sorrows only are thy guests,</l>
					<l>And thine the only music of their sighs,</l>
					<l>Thick sobbing from the tempest of their breasts!</l>
					<l>Ah, mournful dwelling! never hast thou seen,</l>
					<l>Amidst the numerous wretched-ones immur'd</l>
					<l>Within thy stone-girt compass, wretch so sunk,</l>
					<l>So lost, so ruin'd, as the man who falls</l>
					<l>Thus, in deep anguish, on thy ruthless floor,</l>
					<l>And bathes it with the torrent of his tears!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1">And can it be? or is it all a dream?</l>
					<l>A vapour of the mind?--I scarce believe</l>
					<l>Myself awake or acting. Sudden thus</l>
					<l>Am I--so compass'd round with comforts late,</l>
					<l>Health, Freedom, Peace! torn, torn from all, and lost!</l>
					<l>A Prisoner in------Impossible! I sleep:</l>
					<l>'Tis Fancy's coinage; 'tis a dream's delusion.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1">Vain dream! vain Fancy! Quickly am I rous'd</l>
					<l>To all the dire reality's distress:</l>
					<l>I tremble, start, and feel myself awake,</l>
					<l>Dreadfully awake to all my woes; and roll</l>
					<l>From wave to wave on Sorrow's ocean tost!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1">Oh for a moment's pause,--a moment's rest,</l>
					<l>To calm my hurried spirits! to recall</l>
					<l>Reflection's staggering pilot to the helm,</l>
					<l>And still the maddening whirlwind in my soul!</l>
					<l>--It cannot be! The din increases round:</l>
					<l>Rough voices rage discordant; dreadful shrieks!</l>
					<l>Hoarse imprecations dare the Thunderer's ire,</l>
					<l>And call down swift damnation! Thousand chains</l>
					<l>In dismal notes clink, mirthful! Roaring bursts</l>
					<l>Of loud obstreperous laughter, and strange choirs</l>
					<l>Of gutturals, dissonant and rueful, vex</l>
					<l>E'en the dull ear of Midnight! Neither rest,</l>
					<l>Nor peaceful calm, nor silence of the mind,</l>
					<l>Refreshment sweet! nor interval or pause</l>
					<l>From morn to eve, from eve to morn is found</l>
					<l>Amidst the surges of this troubled sea! <note n="12" place="foot" resp="Dodd">It is but a just tribute to Mr. Akerman, the
							Keeper of this dismal place, to observe, that all the evils here enumerated are the immediate consequences of promiscuous
							confinement, and no way chargeable to Mr. A's account. It is from the strictest observation, I am persuaded, that no man
							could do more in the present circumstances. His attention is great, and his kindness and humanity to those in sickness or
							affliction peculiarly pleasing. I can bear testimony to many signal instances, which I have remarked since my sad
							confinement.</note>

					<l rendition="#indent1">So, from the Leman Lake th' impetuous Rhone</l>
					<l>His blue waves pushes rapid; and bears down</l>
					<l>(Furiate to meet Saone's pellucid stream,</l>
					<l>With roar tremendous, thro' the craggy streights</l>
					<l>Of Alpine rocks) his freight of waters wild!</l>
					<l>Still rushing in perturbed eddies on;</l>
					<l>And still, from hour to hour, from age to age,</l>
					<l>In conflux vast and unremitting, pours</l>
					<l>His boisterous flood to old Lugdunum's walls!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1">Oh my rack'd brain--oh my distracted heart!</l>
					<l>The tumult thickens: wild disorder grows</l>
					<l>More painfully confus'd!----And can it be? </l>
					<l>Is this the mansion--this the House ordain'd</l>
					<l>For Recollection's solemn purpose?--This</l>
					<l>The place from whence full many a flitting soul</l>
					<l>(The work of deep Repentence--mighty work,</l>
					<l>Still, still to be perform'd) must mount to God,</l>
					<l>And give its dread account! Is this the place</l>
					<l>Ordain'd by Justice, to confine awhile</l>
					<l>The foe to civil order, and return</l>
					<l>Reform'd and moraliz'd to social life!</l>
					<l>This Den of drear confusion, wild uproar,</l>
					<l>Of mingled Riot, and unblushing Vice!</l>
					<l>This School of Infamy! from whence, improv'd</l>
					<l>In every hardy villainy, returns</l>
					<l>More harden'd, more a foe to God and Man,</l>
					<l>The miscreant, nurs'd in its infectious lap;</l>
					<l>All cover'd with its pestilential spots,</l>
					<l>And breathing death and poison wheresoe'er</l>
					<l>He stalks contagious! from the lion's den</l>

					<l>And truly! for through Ages we may trust</l>
					<l>'Twill interpose between our crimes and God,</l>
					<l>And turn away his just avenging scourge--</l>
					<l>"The National Humanity!" Hither then,</l>
					<l>Ye Sons of Pity, and ye Sons of Thought!--</l>
					<l>Whether by public zeal, and patriot love,</l>
					<l>Or by Compassion's gentle stirrings wrought,</l>
					<l>Oh hither come, and find sufficient scope</l>
					<l>For all the Patriot's, all the Christian's search!</l>
					<l>Some great, some salutary plan to frame,</l>
					<l>Turning confinement's curses into good;</l>
					<l>And, like the God who but rebukes to save,</l>

					<l>Offending Mortals?--Justice on her throne</l>
					<l>Rigid on this hand to Example points;</l>
					<l>More mild to Reformation upon that:</l>

					<l>Of madding, drunken, thoughtless, ruthless gaze,</l>
					<l>Or giddy curiosity and vain!</l>
					<l>Their Deeds still more emphatic, note; and see,</l>
					<l>By the sad spectacle unimpress'd, they dare</l>
					<l>Even in the eye of death, what to their doom</l>
					<l>Brought their expiring Fellows! Learn we hence,</l>
					<l>How to Example's salutary end</l>
					<l>Our Justice sagely ministers! But one,--</l>
					<l>Should there be one--thrice hapless,--of a mind</l>
					<l>By guilt unharden'd, and above the throng</l>
					<l>Of desperate miscreants, thro' repeated crimes</l>
					<l>In stupor lull'd, and lost to every sense;--</l>
					<l>Ah me, the sad reverse!--should there be one</l>
					<l>Of generous feelings; whom remorseless Fate,</l>
					<l>Pallid Necessity, or chill Distress,</l>
					<l>The Family's urgent call, or just demand</l>
					<l>Of honest Creditor,--(solicitudes</l>

					<l>At Torture's bare idea, would you tear</l>
					<l>Worse than on racking wheels a Soul like This;</l>
					<l>And make him to the stupid Crowd a gaze</l>
					<l>For lingering hours?--drag him along to death</l>
					<l>An useless spectacle; and more than flay</l>
					<l>Your living victim?--Death is your demand:</l>

					<l>Confus'd, is lost in sorrows: Down mine Eyes</l>
					<l>Stream the full Tears,! Distress is all alive,</l>
					<l>And quick Imagination's pulse beats high!</l>

					<l rendition="#indent1">"Dear Father! is it thou?" Methought his ghost</l>
					<l>Glided in silence by me! Not a word,--</l>
					<l>While mournfully he shakes his dear pale face!</l>
					<l>O stay, thou much lov'd parent! stay, and give</l>
					<l>One word of consolation; if allow'd</l>
					<l>To Son, like whom so Son hath ever lov'd,</l>
					<l>None ever suffer'd! See, it comes again:</l>
					<l>August it flits across th' astonish'd room!</l>
					<l>I know thee well, thy beauteous image know:</l>
					<l>Dear Spirit! stay; and take me to the world</l>
					<l>Where thou art! And where thou art, oh my Father!</l>
					<l>I must, I must be happy.--Every day</l>
					<l>Thou know'st, remembrance hath embalm'd thy love,</l>
					<l>And wish'd thy presence. Melancholy thought!</l>
					<l>At last to meet thee in a place like this:</l>
					<l>Oh stay, and waft me instant--But, 'tis gone,</l>
					<l>The dear delusion! He nor hears my words,</l>
					<l>My filial anxiety, nor regards</l>
					<l>My pleading tears. 'Twas but a coinage vain</l>
					<l>Of the distemper'd fancy! Gone, 'tis gone!</l>
					<l>And here I'm left a trembling wretch, to weep</l>
					<l>Unheard, unpitied left, to weep alone!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1">Nor thou, Maria, with me! Oh, my Wife!</l>
					<l>And is this bitter with the bitterest mix'd;</l>
					<l>That I must lose thy heavenly company,</l>
					<l>And consolation soothing! Yet, 'tis best:</l>
					<l>Thy tenderness, thy presence, doth but wound</l>
					<l>And stab to the keenest quick my bursting heart!</l>
					<l>"I have undone thee!" Can I then sustain</l>
					<l>Thy killing aspect, and that tender tear,</l>
					<l>Which secret steals a-down thy lovely face,</l>
					<l>Dissembling smiles, to cheer me!--Cheer me, Heavens!</l>
					<l>Look on the mighty ruin I have pluck'd,</l>
					<l>Pluck'd instant, unsuspected, in the hour</l>
					<l>Of Peace and dear Security on her head!</l>
					<l>And where--O where can Cheefulness be found?</l>
					<l>Mine must be Mourning ever. Oh my Wife,</l>
					<l>"I have undone thee!"--What th' infuriate hand</l>
					<l>Of foes vindictive could not have achiev'd,</l>
					<l>In mercy would not, I have wrought! Thy Husband!</l>
					<l>Thy Husband, lov'd with such unshaken truth,</l>
					<l>Thy Husband, lov'd with such a steady flame,</l>
					<l>From Youth's first hour!--Ev'n He hath on thee pluck'd,</l>
					<l>On thee, his Soul's Companion, Life's best Friend,</l>
					<l>Such desolation, as to view would draw</l>
					<l>From the wild Savage Pity's deepest groan!</l>

					<l rendition="#indent1">Yes, yes, thou coward Mimic! pamper'd Vice!</l>
					<l>High praise be sure is thine! Thou hast obtain'd</l>
					<l>A worthy triumph! <note n="18" place="foot" resp="Dodd">Alluding to the character of Mrs. Simony, introduced by Mr. Foote in

					<l>A weak, an amiable female heart,</l>
					<l>A conjugal heart most faithful, most attach'd:</l>
					<l>--Yet can I pardon thee: for, poor Buffoon!</l>
					<l>Thy vices must be fed; and thou must live,</l>
					<l>Luxurious live, a foe to God and Man;</l>
					<l>Commission'd live, thy poison to diffuse,</l>
					<l>And taint the Public Virtue with thy Crimes.</l>
					<l>Yes, I can pardon thee--low as thou art,</l>
					<l>And far too mean an object ev'n of scorn:</l>
					<l>For thou her merits knew'st not. Hadst thou known,</l>
					<l>Thou,--callous as thou art to every sense</l>
					<l>Of human feeling, every nobler touch</l>
					<l>Of generous sensibility:--even thou</l>
					<l>Could'st not have wanton pierc'd her gentle breast;</l>
					<l>But at a distance awful wouldst have stood,</l>
					<l>And, like thy Prototype of oldest time,</l>
					<l>View'd her just virtues pass in triumph by,</l>
					<l>And own'd, howe'er reluctant-----</l>
