					<l>Dread'st thou an earthly bar? Thou, who so oft</l>
					<l>In contemplation serious hast employ'd</l>
					<l>Thy dearest meditations on a Bar</l>
					<l>Tremendously decisive! who so oft</l>
					<l>That Bar's important terrors hast display'd</l>
					<l>To crowds attentive; with the solemn theme</l>
					<l>Rapt into thought profound?--And beats thy heart</l>
					<l>With throbs tumultuous;--fail thy trembling knees,</l>
					<l>Now that in Judgment thou must stand before</l>
					<l>Weak mortals, like thyself! and soon, like thee,</l>
					<l>Shivering with guilt and apprehensions dire,</l>
					<l>To answer in dread Judgment 'fore their God?</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1">What gives that Judgment terror? Guilt, pale Guilt;</l>
					<l>Conscience accusing stern; the fiery Law,</l>
					<l>The terrible hand-writing on the wall!</l>
					<l>But vanish these,--that mighty Day's-Man found,</l>
					<l>Who, smiling on Confession's genuine tear,</l>
					<l>The meek repentant aspect, and the hand</l>
					<l>With ready, perfect retribution fraught,</l>
					<l>Urges complete his ransom, and sets free</l>
					<l>Th' immortal prisoner.--But, ah me! on earth</l>
					<l>Such golden mercy reigns not: here is found</l>
					<l>No potent Day's-Man; here no ransom full,</l>
					<l>No clement Mediator. Here stern Law,</l>
					<l>With visage all-unbending, eyes alone</l>
					<l>The rigorous Act. Confession here is Guilt,</l>
					<l>And Restitution perfect, perfect loss!</l>
					<l>Ah me the while, here men the Judges are;</l>
					<l>And there, th' Omnificent, Mercy's source and stream!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1">Triumphant consolation! Firm in Faith,</l>
					<l>And justify'd by Him whose precious blood</l>
					<l>For Man flow'd liberal, the Soul, secure</l>
					<l>Of future acceptation at that Bar</l>
					<l>Of trial most momentous, soars above</l>
					<l>The World's severest trials, <note n="19" place="foot" resp="Dodd">The verses subjoined were written by the King of Prussia,
							after a defeat, when one of his General Officers had proposed to set him the example of self-destruction: <lg type="stanza">
<l>Dan ces jours, pleins d'alarmes,</l>
<l>La constance et la fermete</l>
<l>Sont les boucliers et les
									armes</l>
<l>Que j'oppose a l'adversite:</l>
<l>Que le Destin me persecute,</l>
<l>Qu'il prepare ou hate ma
									chute,</l>
<l>Le danger ne peut m ebranler:</l>
<l>Quand le vulgaire est plein de crainte,</l>
<l>Que l'esperance
									semble, eteinte, </l>
<l>L'homme fort doit se signaler.</l>
</lg> A friend having given Dr. Dodd in prison a copy of
							these Lines, he was much pleased with them, and immediately paraphrased them as follows: <lg type="stanza">
<l>In these sad
									moments of severe distress,</l>
<l>When dangers threaten, and when sorrows press,</l>
<l>For my defence behold what
									arms are given</l>
<l>--Firmness of soul, and Confidence in Heaven!</l>
<l>With these, tho' Fortune hunt me thro'
									the land,</l>
<l>Tho' instant, utter ruin seem at hand!</l>
<l>Compos'd and self-collected I remain,</l>
<l>Nor start
									at perils, nor of ills complain:</l>
<l>To mean Despair the low, the servile fly,</l>
<l>When Hope's bright star
									seems darken'd in their sky:</l>
<l>Then shines the Christian, and delights to prove </l>
<l>His faith unshaken, and
									unchang'd his Love!</l>
</lg>
						</note>and can view</l>
					<l>Serene the horrors of an earthly Bar,</l>
					<l>Tho' far than death more horrid. Yes, kind Death,</l>
					<l>How preferable far thy sight to me!</l>
					<l>Oh that, without this tedious, dread detail</l>
					<l>Of awful circumstance,--this long, sad pomp</l>
					<l>Of ministering wretchedness, thy friendly shaft</l>
					<l>Had instant reach'd, and pierc'd my tortur'd Heart:</l>
					<l>How had I blest the stroke, and been at peace!</l>
					<l>But, thro' a dreary avenue of woe,</l>
					<l>A lengthen'd vault of black distress and shame,</l>
					<l>With mournful melancholy sable hung,</l>
					<l>Must I be led, <note n="20" place="foot" resp="Dodd">

					<l>Obedient bows,--Oh for impartial search!</l>
					<l>Oh for a Trial strict, to trace the Cause,</l>

					<l>How ill exchang'd for those, which busier scenes </l>
					<l>To the World's Follies dedicate, engross'd,</l>
					<l>In specious trifling; all important deem'd, </l>
					<l>While gilt, O Chesterfield! with seeming gold</l>

					<l rendition="#indent4"> Sought by Thee,</l>

					<l>And with me to the task, delighted, brought</l>
					<l>The upright purpose, the intention firm</l>
					<l>To fill the charge, to justify the choice,</l>
					<l>Perchance too flattering to my Heart; a Heart</l>
					<l>Frank, inexpert, unhackney'd in the World,</l>

					<l>In that World's artful style, Judges severe;</l>

					<l>(Though set that Sun, alas! in misty clouds);</l>

					<l>Have flatter'd?--And still more, when urg'd, approv'd,</l>
					<l>And bless'd by Thee, St. David's! Honour'd Friend;</l>
					<l>Alike in Wisdom's and in Learning's School</l>
					<l>Advanc'd and sage!---Short pause, my Muse, and sad</l>
					<l>Allow, while leaning on Affection's arm</l>
					<l>Deep-sighing Gratitude, with Tears of Truth,</l>
					<l>Bedews the Urn, the happy Urn, where rest</l>

					<l>Whose Life bound up with thine in amity</l>
					<l>Indissolubly firm, felt thy last pang</l>
					<l>Disrupting as her own; gently sigh'd forth</l>

					<l>By gradual declension yield my trust,</l>
					<l>My humble happy trust on Thee, my God!</l>
					<l>How ill exchang'd for confidence in Man,</l>
					<l>In Chesterfields, in Princes!--Wider scenes,</l>
					<l>Alps still on Alps were open'd to my view;</l>
					<l>And, as the circle in the Flood enlarg'd,</l>

					<l>Of promises delusive----"Onward still!</l>
					<l>"Press onward!" cried the World's alluring voice;</l>
					<l>"The time of retribution is at hand:</l>
					<l>"See the ripe Vintage waits thee!" Fool, and blind,</l>
					<l>Still credulous I heard, and still pursued</l>
					<l>The airy meteor glittering, thro' the mire,</l>
					<l>Thro' brake and bog, till more and more ingulph'd</l>
					<l>In the deceitful quag, floundering I lay.</l>
					<l>Nor heard was then the World's alluring voice,</l>
					<l>Or promises delusive: Then not seen</l>
					<l>The Tree umbrageous, with its ample shade:</l>
					<l>For me, alas, that Tree had shade no more!</l>
					<l>But, struggling in the gulph, my languid Eye</l>
					<l>Saw only round the barren rushy Moor,</l>
					<l>The flat, wide, dreary Desert:--Till a Hope,</l>
					<l>Dress'd by the Tempter in an Angel's form,</l>
					<l>Presenting its fair hand,--imagin'd fair,</l>
					<l>Though foul as murkiest Hell,--to drag me forth,</l>
					<l>Down to the centre plung'd me, dark and dire</l>
					<l>Of howling Ruin;--bottomless Abyss</l>
					<l>Of desolating Shame, and nameless Woe!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg type="stanza">
					<l rendition="#indent1">But, witness Heaven and Earth, 'midst this brief stage,</l>
					<l>This blasting period of my chequer'd Life,</l>
					<l>Tho' by the World's gay vanities allur'd,</l>
					<l>I danc'd, too oft, alas! with the wild rout</l>
					<l>Of thoughtless Fellow-Mortals, to the sound</l>
					<l>Of Folly's tinkling Bells; tho' oft, too oft,</l>
					<l>Those pastimes shar'd enervating, which ill</l>
					<l>--Howe'er by some judg'd innocent,--become</l>
					<l>Religion's sober character and garb:</l>
					<l>Tho' oft, too oft, by weak compliance led,</l>
					<l>External seemings, and the ruinous bait</l>
					<l>Of smooth politeness, what my heart condemn'd</l>
					<l>Unwise it practis'd;--never without pang!</l>
					<l>Tho' too much influenc'd by the pleasing force</l>
					<l>Of native generosity, uncurb'd</l>
					<l>And unchastis'd (as Reason, Duty taught),</l>
					<l>Prudent Economy, in thy sober School</l>
					<l>Of parsimonious Lecture; useful lore,</l>
					<l>And of prime moment to our worldly weal;</l>
					<l>--Yet, witness Heaven and Earth, amidst this Dream,</l>
					<l>This transient Vision, ne'er so slept my Soul,</l>
					<l>Or sacrific'd my Hands at Folly's Shrine,</l>
					<l>As to forget Religion's publick Toil,</l>
					<l>Study's improvement, or the pleading cause</l>

							following Address, which he wrote and inserted in the Publick Ledger of the 1st January 1776, will, in some measure,
							explain his purpose: <quote rendition="#center">To the Wealthy in the Commercial World</quote>
							<quote>I have often wished most sincerely to see a charitable Fund established in this great and trading City, for the
								beneficent purpose of "lending to honest and industrious Tradesmen small sums without interest, and on a reasonable
								Security." The benefits which would arise from such an establishment are too obvious to need enumeration. Almost every
								News-paper tends more and more to convince me of the necessity of such a plan; for in almost every News-paper we read
								Advertisements from Tradesmen, soliciting little sums in their distress; and offering--poor unhappy men! even premiums
								for those little sums. It is not possible but that persons occupied in trade and commerce must feel for the
								difficulties of their brethren, and be ready to promote the undertaking I would wish to recommend, although on no
								interested motives;--for I am no Tradesman, nor can any way be benefitted by the plan. Pure good will, and a
								compassionate respect to the hardships and distresses of my fellow-creatures actuate my heart: And from these motives,
								I shall be happy to proceed upon, and prosecute this plan, with all the efforts and assiduity I am able, if it shall
								be approved by the benevolent, and they will testfy that approbation, and desire of concurrence, by a line directed to
								D. at Anderton's Coffee-house, Fleet-street. In consequence of which, should a probability of success appear, a
								meeting shall speedily be advertised in the Papers, and all measures pursued, to put the good design into immediate
								execution, which on such a meeting may be judged advisable. It may be proper just to observe, that in many cities
								abroad,--at Rome in particular,--there are institutions of this sort: and there has been one established for many
								years at Dublin, which is found productive of the happiest consequences. It is made in Scripture one characteristic of
								the good man, "that he is merciful and lendeth"; and a very small sum, thus given to a permanent establishment, may
								enable a man to lend for perpetuity! How can we better begin the New Year, my worthy and humane countrymen! than by
								entering on a work, which may draw down upon us God's blessing, by our charitable relief to many sons and daughters of

					<l>When sleeps its clayey Prison in the Grave,</l>
					<l>And forth it bursts to Liberty! Methought</l>
					<l>--Such was the vision--in a lowly vale</l>
					<l>Myself I found, whose living green was deck'd</l>
					<l>With all the beauteous family of Spring;</l>
					<l>Pale Primrose, modest Violet, Hare-bell blue,</l>

					<l>Still straiter; and more sharp the pointed briars</l>
					<l>Entangling! With insulting sneers the croud,</l>

					<l>When, in a moment, thro' the dungeon's gloom</l>
					<l>Burst Light resplendent as the mid-day Sun,</l>
					<l>From adamantine shield of Heavenly proof,</l>

					<l>Benignant, pointed to a crimson Cross</l>
					<l>On his bright Shield poutray'd. A milder form,</l>
					<l>Yet of celestial sweetness,--such as oft </l>

					<l>Transported rush'd! High on sapphire Throne,</l>
					<l>Amidst a flame like carbuncle, sat Love,</l>
					<l>Beaming forth living rays of Light and Joy</l>
					<l>On choral crowds of Spirits infinite,</l>
					<l>In Immortality and Glory cloth'd;</l>
					<l>And hymning lofty Strains to Minstrelsy</l>
					<l>Of golden Harps accorded, in His praise,</l>
					<l>Love, uncreate, essential; Love, which bled;</l>
