               <p>In this section, we present the entirety of Dorothy Wordsworth’s first Grasmere journal
                  notebook, DCMS 20. This notebook includes entries for 172 days, from 14 May to 22
                  December 1800, as well as other miscellaneous material Dorothy copied into the pages.
                  The contents of this single notebook are reproduced through diplomatic transcription,
                  meaning that we record as closely as possible the appearance of the text in the original
                  manuscript. Thus, we preserve all of Dorothy’s original spellings and abbreviations
                  and her marks of revision (corrections, cancellations, substitutions) as well as,
                  where possible, other nonlinguistic marks (such as lines she draws between some journal
                  entries), in addition to her line and page breaks. There are multiple reasons for
                  keeping editorial intervention to a minimum. By copying Dorothy’s words and punctuation
                  as they appear on the page, we make her compositional processes more available to
                  interpretation—processes that are often obscured in regularized edited versions of
                  the journal. For example, her use of contractions, abbreviations, and ampersands suggests
                  that she wrote in haste. For similar reasons, we include all of her journal entries
                  rather than editorial selections. By reviewing each entry, it is possible to follow
                  her daily routines as she recorded them, over a six-month period, without focusing
                  on exceptional entries or events. The preservation of line breaks reminds readers
                  of the diplomatic transcription of the small size of the notebook Dorothy used and
                  the short nature of the entries themselves. In sum, this straightforward presentation
                  supports understanding of the material practices and structures within which Dorothy
                  wrote all four notebooks of her now-famous Grasmere journals. </p>

            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.3"><a id="Return"><!--anchor--></a><h3>A. Return to the Lakes </h3>
               <p>Dorothy and William Wordsworth were born (in 1771 and 1770, respectively) in Cockermouth,
                  Cumberland (now Cumbria), about 25 miles northwest of Grasmere. They and their three
                  brothers were separated after the death of their mother in 1778: Dorothy was sent
                  to live with her mother’s cousin in Halifax, West Yorkshire (and later with other
                  relatives), while William was sent with his brother Richard to Hawkshead Grammar School,
                  six miles due south of Grasmere (see fig. 2.3). William and Dorothy did not see each
                  other again for nine years. They were together briefly in 1787, before William went
                  to Cambridge, and ultimately, they lived together in various residences from 1795
                  onward, first in Racedown, Dorsetshire, and then in Alfoxden, Somerset, southwest
                  of Bristol. On 17 December 1799 (after a cold winter spent in Goslar, Germany), brother
                  and sister moved to Town End, Grasmere, adopting the home now known as Dove Cottage.
                  They would live in Grasmere and the nearby village of Rydal (see fig. 2.3) for the
                  rest of their lives. The first surviving journal of their time after returning to
                  live in the Lakes, Dorothy’s first Grasmere journal was begun on 14 May 1800, in a
                  very small notebook (at 15 x 9.5 cm, it is only slightly larger than an iPhone 8),
                  now known as DCMS 20. </p>
               <p>The entries in this journal notebook therefore offer the first glimpses into the siblings’
                  lives after returning to the Lake District, covering the second half of their first
                  year in Grasmere and tracing Dorothy’s activities as they set up their own household
                  and began, for the first time, to live on their own terms. It was an important period
                  for the Wordsworths, a moment that combined a sense of homecoming with experiences
                  of dislocation and itinerancy. At least in this first year, they were not quite locals,
                  though they were not quite tourists either. Upon moving to Grasmere, Dorothy and William
                  began the practical labor of creating a home for themselves, as they improved their
                  cottage and garden; made new friendships, particularly with two families resident
                  nearby, the Simpsons and the Lloyds; nourished old intimacies, especially with the
                  Coleridges and the Hutchinsons; reacquainted themselves with Lakeland ways; and walked
                  everywhere, having no other means of transportation and being devoted to pedestrianism
                  as a form of recreation and exploration. The journal also reports on an essential
                  period of their shared literary life, as William composed poetry for the second volume
                  of the second edition of <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> (1800) and as brother and sister prepared the volume for the press.</p>
               <p>The opening entry in the journal (see fig. 2.1 for its first page and fig. 2.2 for
                  pages 4 and 5) is dramatic. In it, Dorothy takes up her pen after the departure of
                  her two brothers, John and William, to visit Mary, Sara, and Tom Hutchinson in their
                  new home in Yorkshire. John, a sailor, had come to live with Dorothy and William in
                  January 1800, after an eight-year separation. William and Dorothy knew the Hutchinsons
                  from Penrith, where Dorothy had gone to live with her maternal grandparents as a 16-year-old.
                  William met the Hutchinsons during school holidays; and he would later marry Mary
                  Hutchinson, in October 1802. All of this context informs our reading of this first
                  entry, which begins with an emotional intensity that is not often repeated. Dorothy
                  finds herself overwhelmed upon saying goodbye to William (“My heart was so full that
                  I could hardly speak to W when I gave him a farewell kiss”); she describes the “flood
                  of tears” that follows and ends the entry with a wish for a letter from her brother
                  (“Oh! that I had a letter from William!”), even though he has only just left. The
                  entry is also remarkable for its length (at 450 words, it is the longest entry that
                  does not involve Dorothy trying to catch up on multiple days) and because, in it,
                  Dorothy describes herself in the present moment of journal writing (“It is nine o’clock,
                  I shall soon go to bed.”). Normally, her journal is retrospective, but in key instances
                  Dorothy writes to the moment. </p>

               <p>In this entry, Dorothy reflects, directly for the first and only time in the surviving
                  journals, on her purpose for keeping one: </p>

               </div>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.5">
               <p>To be sure, she would discover additional uses for the journal over time (just as
                  she had prior uses, as is evidenced in the sums found at the top of fig. 2.1), but
                  here she frames her resolution to keep it primarily as a means of consoling herself
                  for the grief she feels at the departure of her brothers (“because I will not quarrel
                  with myself”) and as a gift for William upon his return, presumably because it will
                  allow him to share in her daily activities, thoughts, and encounters. The speed with
                  which Dorothy wrote this and most of her other entries is apparent in pages 4 and
                  5 of her first journal entry (fig. 2.2). Notice, for instance, her use of abbreviations
                  (W and W<sup>m</sup> for William, J for John); in the cancellation of “my,” possibly because it was written
                  too close to the previous word, followed by her rewriting “myself”; and in the deleted
                  and undecipherable word in the middle of page 4. The minuteness of the notebook is
                  also apparent in the very short lines (most have only five to seven words) and in
                  the formation of letters, which though legible are often far from neat.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Within this first entry, we see how Dorothy’s stated aims coalesce. The act of recording
                     her daily activities offers her solace for her loneliness and allows her to reflect
                     on the productive nature of her days, spent working in the house and garden, reading
                     and writing, visiting with friends, and walking. These activities follow the daily
                     rhythms of life: the chores necessary to run a household, such as washing and mending,
                     as well as those tasks she seems to have taken special pleasure in, such as gathering
                     plants and flowers for her garden. At the end of the first entry, for example, Dorothy
                     reports, “Arrived at home with a bad head-ach – set some slips of privett. The evening
                     cold – had a fire – my face now flame-coloured.” This entry offers a foretaste of
                     the descriptions to come, as she enumerates her daily household chores, all undertaken
                     with a bad headache on a cold May day, after a long and emotionally draining walk.
                     Throughout this notebook, we learn that Dorothy had help with some chores, as she
                     mentions her neighbors from the cottage across the road, John Fisher; his wife, Aggy
                     (Agnes); and his sister Molly (Mary) Fisher. Pamela Woof notes that Molly was paid
                     two shillings a week “to clean, light fires, wash dishes, prepare vegetables, do the
                     weekly small clothes wash, and the 5-weekly ‘great wash.’” 
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                              (1)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>GJ, 165.</span></div>

                  </p>
               </div>
               <p>Still, Dorothy had “a good deal” to do (in her own oft-repeated phrase)—ironing, baking,
                  weeding—work that was physically demanding and time-consuming but that also represented
                  more acceptable forms of labor for a middle-class woman. The kitchen garden was an
                  important source of food, such as peas and turnips, and it is evident that much effort
                  was needed to grow and harvest these crops, as it was more generally to manage a home
                  at the beginning of the nineteenth century, in one of the wettest parts of England,
                  with minimal help from servants. She also engaged in shoemaking, wallpapering, and
                  mattress making, with one mattress being sent to the Coleridges in Keswick. Dorothy
                  took delight and pride in her pleasure garden, and she transplanted the mosses, plants,
                  and flowers that she gathered on her walks or bought from others. When William returned
                  on 7 June, they stayed up until 4:00 a.m. “so he had an opportunity of seeing [their]
                  improvements” when the sun came up, and she expressed satisfaction two days later
                  when a party in “a coronetted Landau [a luxury carriage bearing an insignia of the
                  nobility] . . . (evidently tourists) turned an eye of interest upon [their] little
                  garden &amp; cottage.” </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.6"><a id="Walking"><!--anchor--></a><h3>B. Walking in the Lakes </h3>
               <p>Dorothy’s encounter with tourists traveling by landau contrasts strongly with her
                  own pedestrianism. The Wordsworths had no horse or carriage in their early Grasmere
                  days and got around on foot. Indeed, perhaps most striking to the modern reader of
                  DCMS 20 is the centrality of walking to Dorothy’s daily life, an activity that brought
                  her into close contact with a landscape she loved, with friends and family (with and
                  to whom she often walked), and with the local farmers and shepherds, beggars, and
                  itinerant laborers who also traversed the neighborhood. Indeed, walking emerges as
                  an organizing feature of her (and her brother’s) daily life. She repeatedly speaks
                  about going out for “[her] walk,” suggesting that it is the walk itself—the physical
                  activity and the opportunity it allows for experiencing her natural surroundings—that
                  serves as the prime motivator for the activity. She rambles through almost all weather,
                  in all seasons, in rain and snow, by moon and starlight, often not returning home
                  until late in the evening. Dorothy was proud of her skill and endurance as a walker.
                  On 18 May, she notes, “I was overtaken by 2 Cumberland people on the other side of
                  Rydale who complimented me upon my walking.” In most entries, Dorothy takes care to
                  describe all of these activities: whether and where she has walked, her household
                  chores, her engagement in sociable activities, and her participation in intellectual
                  and literary work such as reading, copying, writing letters, and, of course, keeping
                  her journal. As the record of an indefatigable pedestrian and a young, single woman
                  interested in the lives and livelihood of others of all ages and social classes, the
                  journal provides its readers with a tour, informal and unplotted as it is, as well
                  as with commentary on the Lake District’s topography and ecology, and on the life—social,
                  economic, intellectual, creative—of those who live there. </p>
               <p>Within the lengthy first entry for 14 May 1800, Dorothy records the walk she takes
                  (after parting with her brothers at the shores of Lake Windermere), including the
                  route she took and her observations along the way. She describes three encounters
                  with individuals as she walks along the public roads: with a blind man driving bulls,
                  with a poor woman from Rydal who begs a half penny, and with a young woman from Manchester
                  who has buried three children and a husband in a pauper’s grave. Walking thus affords
                  Dorothy opportunities for encountering both nature and human nature, and these experiences
                  weave throughout the journal. (Some of them, famously, reappear in William’s poems.)
                  The Rydal woman tells Dorothy that she has never begged before but has been forced
                  to do so because of these “hard times.” The representation of poor men, women, and
                  children, many of whom are homeless and itinerant and forced to beg, whom she meets
                  on her walks and at her door (Dove Cottage was then on the main road, so it was a
                  usual place for those passing through to stop and beg for money or food), attest to
                  the economic dislocations of industrialization and war affecting England at the start
                  of the new century. </p>
               <p>Dorothy’s record of and response to the speech, appearance, and actions of these distressed
                  people form an important aspect of her journal. She often reflects on the residents
                  of the vale and how they too are adversely affected by the “hard times.” On 18 May,
                  she quotes her neighbor, John Fisher, who expresses concern “about the alteration
                  in the times,” observing “that in a short time there would be only two ranks of people,
                  the very rich &amp; the very poor, for those who have small estates says he are forced
                  to sell, &amp; all the land goes into one hand.” Several years later, she would address
                  the dire circumstances of small landowners in <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.Greens-intro"><em>A Narrative concerning George &amp; Sarah Green of the Parish of Grasmere addressed to
                        a Friend</em> (1808)</a>. In her journal entries and elsewhere, we find Dorothy expressing her awareness of
                  and sympathy for the suffering of those around her, as well as her desire to voice
                  their concerns. Indeed, her walking could itself be seen as an act of solidarity with
                  the poor.</p>
               <p>Rarely is there an entry in this notebook that does not mention walking. Even when
                  she does not walk, an explanation is usually given for why it has not been possible
                  to do so (the reasons are illness, visitors, or severe weather). Of the 172 days recorded
                  in the journal, Dorothy reports walking on 125, or 73 percent of the total. On 37
                  of these days, she reports walking two or three times. Some of these walks are left
                  unspecified, such as on 23 November, when we are simply told, “Sarah &amp; I walked after
                  dinner.” However, on many if not most days, it is possible to have a much more precise
                  sense of where she goes. Many of Dorothy’s walks are solitary rambles, but, as noted
                  previously, few days go by without Dorothy visiting or being visited by her friends.

               <p>The 1818 map detailed in figure 2.3, with Grasmere in the near center (and Dove Cottage
                  marked by the rectangle on the road to east of the lake), enables us to better visualize
                  her daily walks, which moved in every direction from her home. One frequent destination
                  was the town of Ambleside, to the south, where mail was delivered and picked up, a
                  distance of about four miles each way. Often, she describes taking the route to Ambleside
                  via Clappersgate. In November 1800, Charles Lloyd; his wife, Mary; his sister Priscilla;
                  and their children moved to Old Brathay, southwest of Ambleside (denoted as “Brathay”
                  on the map), and Dorothy visited them frequently. Clappersgate and Brathay are at
                  the head of Lake Windermere, and it was just south of there, at Low Wood on the eastern
                  shore, that Dorothy parted from William and John as reported in her first journal
                  entry. </p>

               <p>More westerly is Langdale, the neighboring vale, under the mountains known as the
                  Langdale Pikes. Dorothy reports walking to Langdale on three occasions (16 and 23
                  June and 7 September): on 16 June she mentions visiting Collath (Colwith) and Skelleth
                  (Skelwith), also visible on the map, and on 23 June she describes seeing Elterwater.
                  She “peeps” into Langdale valley, by climbing around Loughrigg, one of the fells to
                  the south of Grasmere, another two times (30 August and 4 December). To the south
                  and east and closer to home are the neighboring village of Rydal and lake of the same
                  name; and there are also the hills behind Dove Cottage, where Dorothy acquires mosses
                  and plants. </p>

                     In July 1800, Samuel Taylor Coleridge had moved to Keswick, to be nearer to the Wordsworths,
                     his new home at Greta Hall being about 13 miles northeast of Grasmere (along what
                     was known as the Keswick Road, which passed over Dunmail Raise, denoted as “Raise”
                     on the map but spelled as “Rays” by Dorothy). Dorothy walked to Keswick at least three
                     times in the six-month period described in this notebook, in August, November, and
                     finally in December, when her journal entry mentions “snow upon the ground.” On 17
                     November 1800, she records the time it took for her to walk from Dove Cottage to Keswick
                     for this second trip of the year: “Set off at 5 minutes past 10, &amp; arrived at ½ past
                     2.” Thus, she covers about three miles per hour, walking uphill much of the way. Much
                     closer to Grasmere but along the same road is the village of Wythburn, a common turning-around
                     point for Dorothy when she accompanies William on the first part of his journeys to
                     Keswick. Dorothy also frequently walks to Wythburn, the home of Miss Elizabeth Jane
                     Simpson and her father, the Reverend Joseph Simpson, vicar of the village’s small
                     church.

                     to home, is the Easedale valley, often referred to by the Wordsworths as the “Black
                     Quarter”—a favorite place for their walks; one can also see “Helm [Crag]” on the map,
                     the iconic local fell that looks over Grasmere and Easedale, mentioned frequently
                     in the journal along with other surrounding hills.</p>

                  <p>To some extent, Dorothy’s walking habits depend on who is at Dove Cottage with her.
                     After William’s return from his visit to Penrith, her routine changes slightly; she
                     describes less wandering and more fishing on the lake. When she has company, such
                     as during the extended, 3½-week visit with the Coleridges in July or Coleridge’s visit
                     alone in December, she stops writing in her journal, so we learn less about her walking
                     during those periods (see figure 2.6). When Coleridge comes, Dorothy appears to be
                     excluded from some longer and more arduous walks undertaken by the men—for instance,
                     Coleridge, brother John, and William climb Helvellyn (England’s third-highest mountain),
                     Seat Sandal, and the path to Stickle Tarn (Langdale) without her. All three destinations
                     may be seen in figure 2.4. It is not clear why Dorothy did not accompany the men on
                     these 1800 walks. She would not be left out for long. By late 1801, she had attempted
                     Fairfield and reached the summit of Helvellyn. We know from <em>A Narrative concerning George &amp; Sarah Green</em> that by 1808 she had been to Stickle Tarn. In short, Dorothy would make these ascents
                     (and many others) in the years to come.

               <p>Examining and closely reading a single notebook allows us to understand the centrality
                  of walking to Dorothy Wordsworth. Walking was important for her physical and mental
                  health. Certainly, it invested her with a strong sense of independence and personal
                  worth. Many of Dorothy’s later travel narratives also describe her mode of travel
                  as chiefly pedestrian, reflecting the profound importance that walking had for her
                  writing. Furthermore, Dorothy’s inability to walk later in life, when beset by illness,
                  became the subject of one her most celebrated poems, “Thoughts on my sickbed” <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-overview">(see Section 7 of this edition)</a>. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.7"><a id="Writing"><!--anchor--></a><h3>C. Writing the Journals </h3>
               <p>Like most diarists, Dorothy sometimes gets behind, and she writes at highly variable
                  levels of detail. Sometimes she composes retrospectively, and at other times she writes
                  to the moment. In the first entry, as we have seen, she writes in the present, and
                  also on 3 September: “– writing my journal now at 8 o clock.” On 19 October, we seem
                  to catch her writing in installments within a single entry: “We are not to dine till
                  4 o clock ––– Dined at ½ past 5.” Additionally, there are many indications, both direct
                  and indirect, that Dorothy did not consistently write her entries on the day she describes.
                  In an undated entry after 13 September, she notes, “Here I have long neglected my
                  Journal” and inserts a compensatory entry covering the period from 19 to 30 September.
                  An earlier example appears between 25 June and 26 July. Beneath the entry for 25 June,
                  Dorothy reports that the Coleridges arrived on Sunday, 29 June and stayed for over
                  three weeks, departing on Thursday, 24 July (Dorothy mistakes this date as 23 July).
                  In other words, we have a gap of five days. Moreover, in this catch-up entry, Dorothy
                  provides an extremely truncated account of the Coleridges’ visit. All we learn about
                  this 26-day period (Sunday, June 29 to Thursday, July 24) is that on the Friday before
                  her friends’ departure, the group took tea on the island (in Grasmere); that on the
                  Sunday before they had tea in Bainriggs with the Simpsons, Dorothy accompanied Sara
                  Coleridge to Wythburn; and that the weather was hot. We see a similar brevity at play
                  when Coleridge visits in December (there is a gap between 4 and 15 December; see fig.
                  2.6) and when Dorothy travels to Keswick, between 9–16 August and 10–14 December.
                  Sometimes, we conclude, she was just too busy to write. </p>
               <p>The <em>Grasmere Journals</em> have long been read for the way they illuminate the literary labors pursued by, and
                  often shared between, brother and sister. Within the pages of DCMS 20, Dorothy regularly
                  mentions the time she spends reading (sometimes out of doors), writing letters, writing
                  new verse from dictation or copying poetry (such as on 17 December, when she is “Writing
                  all the morning for William”), and of course composing the journal entries themselves.
                  At times, we see such activities overlapping, as when Dorothy copies unpublished stanzas
                  drafted for 
                  “Complaint of the Forsaken Indian Woman,”
                  a poem first published in <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> (1798), at the end of the notebook. The journal documents a shared life and shared
                  work.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>A careful reading of DCMS 20 also enables us to piece together how Dorothy’s journal
                     entries might have been shared with her brother and how William often took inspiration
                     and even phrases from Dorothy’s journals for use in his poems. On 10 June 1800, just
                     a few days after William’s return home on the 7th, Dorothy includes a long narrative
                     recollecting her encounter with a tall beggar woman and her family from more than
                     two weeks prior. In this case, Dorothy reaches back to record a past event, possibly
                     because after William returned home and Dorothy had told him about it, he asked her
                     to describe it in her journal, their common memory device. In a journal entry from
                     13 March 1802, we find a precise description of how William returned to this 1800
                     entry nearly two years later: <span class="quote">‘William finished <em>Alice Fell</em>, &amp; then he wrote the poem of the Beggar woman, taken from a Woman whom I had seen
                        in May–(now nearly 2 years ago) when John &amp; he were at Gallow Hill – – I sate with
                        him at Intervals all the morning, took down his stanzas, &amp;c – . . . . After tea I
                        read to William that account of the little Boys belonging to the tall woman &amp; an unlucky
                        thing it was for he could not escape from those very words, &amp; so he could not write
                        the poem, he left it unfinished &amp; went tired to Bed.

                     an entry for 3 October 1800), which was later used to shape 
                     “Resolution and Independence,”
                      drafted between 4 May and 4 July 1802. Perhaps one of the reasons for the careful
                     preservation of this (and other notebooks) is that the use of the journal entries
                     could be delayed by many years. In some cases, however, the uptake was more immediate:
                     on 11 October 1800, Dorothy describes walking to an abandoned sheepfold in Greenhead
                     Ghyll (the mountain stream that runs to the northeast of the Swan in fig. 2.3), capturing
                     thoughts and images central to William’s poem 
                     “Michael,”
                      which is already being drafted at the time.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Dorothy’s entry of 13 March 1802, discussing William’s vexed attempt to write a poem
                  about the tall beggar woman, suggests that William could feel stimulated but also
                  trapped by Dorothy’s words. It is not known whether the “very words” she uses confine
                  him because he feels obligated not to use them or because—as seems more likely—they
                  dominate his mind, seem impossible to surpass, or do not fit the meter or mode of
                  poetic composition he is attempting. Dorothy seems sympathetic to the writer’s block
                  she has induced (“unlucky thing it was”), though perhaps she takes some pleasure in
                  knowing her words have impact. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The journal’s descriptions of collaboration, whether smooth or frustrated, raise ethical
                     questions about William’s use of Dorothy’s writing. Such questions have long been
                     a source of interest and concern to feminist scholars who, since the 1980s, have raised
                     claims that William appropriated Dorothy’s work and stifled her creativity, preventing
                     her from becoming “more than half a poet.”

                  <p>It is unknown the extent to which Dorothy’s journal notebooks may have been read by
                     others besides William during the period in which they were being written and subsequently
                     during the remaining 55 years that she lived. We do know that William’s nephew, Christopher
                     Wordsworth, learned of their existence and, in his 1851 <em>Memoirs of William Wordsworth</em>, included over 50 pages from the four Grasmere journal notebooks and Dorothy’s unpublished <em>Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland</em>. According to Mary Ellen Bellanca, the “avowed purpose for excerpting her texts [was]
                     to furnish contexts for the poems,”

                     </div> and Christopher directly stated that the “materials” like Dorothy’s journals and letters
                     were to be considered “subordinate and ministerial to the Poems, and illustrative
                     of them.”

                     intrinsic merit, and in particular as a means of presenting Dorothy “in effect, as
                     a nature writer.”

                  <p>Dorothy’s Grasmere-period journals were first presented to the public in a more complete
                     form than the 1851 <em>Memoirs</em> allowed in William Knight’s <em>Journals of Dorothy Wordsworth</em> of 1897. In his introduction, he notes, albeit with some concern, that “many sentences
                     in the Journal present a curious resemblance to words and phrases which occur in the
                     poems.”

                     and describes their importance in terms nearly identical to those articulated by Christopher
                     Wordsworth: <span class="quote">‘[The journal] not only contains exquisite descriptions of Grasmere and its district—a

                        details as flower and tree, bird and beast, mountain and lake—but it casts a flood
                        of light on the circumstances under which her brother’s poems were composed.

                     in the journal that are echoed in William’s poems, a practice that was continued by
                     her next editor, Ernest de Sélincourt, in 1941.

                     of the community (such as drunken priests and battered wives), which he presumably

                  <p>The <em>Grasmere Journals</em> were first initiated into the canon of Romantic literature for the reasons identified
                     by Christopher Wordsworth and William Knight. Brief selections from the journals were
                     the first writing by a woman of the Romantic period to be included in the <em>Norton Anthology of English Literature</em> (in the third edition of 1974), chiefly because they could be used to illuminate William’s
                     poetry.

                     50 years after her first appearance in the <em>Norton</em>, student anthologies continue to emphasize entries that speak to her brother’s poetry,
                     illuminate their shared domestic and emotional life, or (in keeping with the vision
                     of Romanticism as inspired nature writing) foreground Dorothy’s perspicacious observations
                     on her surroundings. For example, the 2000 (7th) edition of the <em>Norton Anthology of English Literature</em> includes only four entries from this first notebook, all of which directly relate
                     to William and his poetry:</p>

               <p>The second edition of the <em>Broadview Anthology of Literature</em> (2006) includes the same first three entries (14 May, 3 and 11 October 1800), and
                  many similar examples might be cited. These anthologizing practices arguably distort
                  the content of the journals, selected because they illuminate William’s creative processes
                  and surroundings. One of our chief aims in representing this first notebook in its
                  entirety (as opposed to making selections from all four Grasmere journal notebooks)
                  has been to focus attention on the richness and diversity of Dorothy’s writing about
                  her life in Grasmere and also to provoke us to understand that while her brother and
                  his poetry were important elements of her life, they were not centrally or exclusively
                  what the journal was about.</p>
               <p>Additionally, many print sources ignore the materiality of the originals and the obvious
                  facts that the entries were handwritten, seemingly quickly, in very small notebooks,
                  often many days after the scenes and events described. Selections such as we find
                  in modern anthologies often provide a false impression of the journal entries as carefully
                  wrought vignettes, products of a reflective, sedate life. This edition counters these
                  impressions by reproducing, as precisely as possibly, Dorothy’s words in a diplomatic
                  transcription. In addition, facsimiles of several notebook pages have been provided
                  to help the reader to understand the appearance and dimensions of the notebook, the
                  entry system Dorothy used, and the handwriting within it. By these means, we can trace
                  how Dorothy missed or misdated days, made strikethroughs and emendations, and generally
                  wrote in haste, in moments snatched at the end of what appear to have been very full
                  and tiring days. We can observe Dorothy including references to individuals and places
                  without providing explanation or context, as it was unnecessary for her to do so given
                  her imagined (and actual) audience of her brother. The next section provides more
                  detail about the material nature of the notebook and our edition of it. </p>

                              and WW lived in Somerset). This manuscript was edited, perhaps heavily, by William
                              Knight, who published it along with the Grasmere-period journals in 1897. Unfortunately,
                              the manuscript has not survived; it may have been lost or destroyed by Knight himself.
                              DW also kept a journal during the early part of her visit, with WW, to Hamburg and

                     what are now called the <em>Grasmere Journals</em>, though there is a gap between the first notebook and the second. The last entry
                     in DCMS 20 is dated 22 December 1800, and it ends midsentence. In another notebook,
                     now missing, Dorothy likely continued this sentence; and she continued that journal
                     in the next surviving Grasmere notebook (DCMS 25), which begins at 10 October 1801,
                     more than nine months after DCMS 20 abruptly ends. Dorothy would continue to write
                     journals, across multiple notebooks, for most of her life. We include selections from

                     stubs of cut-out pages have discernible writing on them, as do the endpapers. As Pamela
                     Woof explains, the stray figures, accounts (see fig. 2.1), lists, and German words
                     indicate that the notebook had been used during the Wordsworths’ visit to Germany

                     however, before that, it had apparently been used the other way round. From the other
                     end, following the five cut-out pages, Dorothy copied down four epitaphs from her
                     visit to Durham in the early summer of 1799.

                     </div> The epigraphs are followed by five unpublished stanzas of William’s “Complaint of
                     the Forsaken Indian Woman,” a poem first published in <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> (1798). These verses end halfway down a page, with the final journal entries for December
                     1800 meeting them but being written with the book rotated 180 degrees (see fig. 2.5).
                     Transcriptions of the epitaphs and William’s poem are included in our edition to demonstrate
                     the heterogeneous nature of the notebook’s contents. They also remind us of the thrift
                     involved in writing within the Wordsworths’ household; as a partially used notebook,
                     with many pages remaining, it was available for reuse. Paper was an expensive commodity
                     during the period, and making the most of a small notebook was another way to practice
                     economy. As a notebook, moreover, DCMS 20 could be easily transported: we know Dorothy
                     had it in Germany, and it is also possible she brought the notebook with her when
                     she went to visit the Coleridges in Keswick, though if she did, she used it sparingly.</p>

                  cancel a word or two, and in those cases where a deleted word (or two or three) cannot
                  be made out, it is noted (as “[illegible deleted word]”) in the transcription. Many
                  of the changes were made in the first instance of writing, as a word was crossed out
                  and immediately replaced in the same line. Dorothy does appear to have returned to
                  the manuscript after the entries had been made, however, and made some changes, particularly
                  to correct dates, which she had frequently mistaken. </p>

                  is erratic. Indeed, often there is no punctuation at all, and when there is, her dashes,
                  periods, and commas are often indistinguishable. We have not edited her writing to
                  include additional punctuation, and we have tried to reproduce her marks as they appear,
                  though doing so often presents a challenge (as in marks appearing in unexpected or
                  indeterminate places or the many canceled words that are impossible to decipher).
                  In addition to her handwriting and mistakes in dating, the lack of punctuation reinforces
                  the conclusion that Dorothy usually wrote quickly. In keeping with the journal form,
                  she dates her entries (though again, often erroneously and irregularly) and uses ruled
                  lines to signify breaks between them. Discernible changes in the ink and handwriting
                  between the entries are rare.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note15"><span class="noteLabel">15. </span><span class="noteBody">Journaling itself was not new to DW. Her first known diary, kept between 20 January
               and 22 May 1798, is known as the Alfoxden Journal (named after the home where she
               and WW lived in Somerset). This manuscript was edited, perhaps heavily, by William
               Knight, who published it along with the Grasmere-period journals in 1897. Unfortunately,
               the manuscript has not survived; it may have been lost or destroyed by Knight himself.
               DW also kept a journal during the early part of her visit, with WW, to Hamburg and
               Goslar, Germany, from 14 September to 1 October 1798. This journal was also included
               by Knight. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
