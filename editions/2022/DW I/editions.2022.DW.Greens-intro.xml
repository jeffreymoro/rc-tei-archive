            <p>I. Contexts</p>
            <p>On 19 March 1808, a local married couple, George and Sarah Green, died attempting to
                cross Langdale Fell on their way home during a storm. They lived at the far end of
                Easedale, about two miles northwest of the Wordsworths, who were living in Dove
                Cottage, Town End, Grasmere, at the time and had employed one of the Greens’
                daughters, Sally, as a maid. The Greens’ deaths orphaned eight children under the
                age of 16 and six under age 11, as well as six grown children by previous
                    marriages.<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note place="end"><p rend="endnote text"

            <p>A. “Laying Schemes” to Help the Orphans</p>
            <p>Nine days after the tragedy, Dorothy reported to her friend Catherine Clarkson that
                the Wordsworths had immediately been “employed in laying schemes to prevent the
                children from falling into the hands of persons who may use them unkindly.”<hi

                            >Letters</hi><hi style="font-size:11pt" xml:space="preserve">, 2:206, DW to Catherine Clarkson, 28 March 1808. DW also criticizes the practice of orphans being boarded in the ”Narrative concerning George &amp; Sarah Green” (hereafter “Narrative”) itself, describing how they were often given “to the lowest Bidder, that is, to board them out with Persons who will take them at the cheapest rate; and such as are the least able to provide for them properly are often the readiest Bidders, for the sake of having a little money coming in.” At 10 years of age, children were made parish apprentices, “at best a slavish condition.” DW also explains how Sarah Green herself had “been a Parish Apprentice and therefore, probably, a neglected Child.” </hi>
                        </p></note></hi> The specific fear was that the young Greens would suffer
                the usual fate of orphans, being boarded out by the parish to foster families paid a
                mere two shillings per week per child. Accordingly, the Wordsworths began to solicit
                donations, and a brief account of the events was written by William and circulated
                to those who might be willing to contribute (see appendix A).<hi

                tireless in their efforts, as William, in a letter to Francis Wrangham dated 17
                April 1808, apologizes for the “dim transcript made by a multiplying writer, we
                having had occasion to make so many copies.”<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note

            <p>A letter from William to Coleridge written precisely one month after the tragedy, on
                19 April 1808, included a copy of a short poem he had written entitled “Elegiac
                Stanzas composed in the Churchyard of Grasmere, Westmorland, a few days after the
                Internment there of a Man and his Wife, Inhabitants of the Vale, who were lost upon
                the neighbouring Mountains, on the night of the nineteenth of March last” (see
                appendix B).<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note place="end"><p rend="endnote text">

                        1808.</hi></p></note></hi> William urged Coleridge, who was then in London
                delivering a series of lectures, to “turn these verses to any profit for the poor
                Orphans in any way, either by reciting, circulating in manuscript or publishing
                them.” William also explained, “As soon as she has leisure Dorothy means to draw up
                a minute detail of all that she knows concerning the lives and characters of the
                Husband and Wife, and everything relating to their melancholy end, and its effect
                upon the Inhabitants of this Vale; a story that will be rich both in pleasure and
                profit.” Dorothy, in fact, had begun drafting her own record at roughly this same
                time, as evidenced by her noting near the beginning of her account, “It was a month
                yesterday since the sad event happened.”<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note
                        place="end"><p rend="endnote text">
                            <hi style="font-size:11pt" xml:space="preserve">DCMS 64, 18. Unless otherwise noted, all quotations from the “Narrative” included in this introduction refer to DCMS 64. </hi></p></note></hi>
                The end of the “Narrative” is signed and dated 4 May 1808, suggesting that Dorothy
                completed it over a period of two weeks. </p>
            <p>The success of the Wordsworths’ efforts in circulating requests for funds is
                immediately apparent upon perusal of the subscription book they kept to record
                donations pledged and received. By the middle of May 1808—just two months after the
                tragedy—more than £300 had been raised, and by September 1808 almost 300 donors had
                pledged nearly £500. Individual pledges varied, as we would expect, largely
                according to the means of the donor, ranging from the 10 guineas given by both the
                Bishop of Llandaff and Lord Muncaster to offerings of mere sixpences by local
                laboring people and servants, many of whom could probably ill afford even these
                small sums. </p>
            <p>Somewhat surprisingly, so far as the records show, the Wordsworths made no direct
                monetary contribution themselves. This was probably owing to their own straitened
                financial circumstances in 1808 or rationalized in terms of their deciding to retain
                Sally Green after the tragedy instead of letting her go, which had been their plan.
                The Wordsworths’ belief that the charity bestowed upon the Greens had, in some way,
                to be circumscribed is readily apparent in their decision to cap at £500 the funds
                raised for the orphans in order not to raise the children above (or at least
                significantly above) their prior station.<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note
                        place="end"><p rend="endnote text"
                            ><hi style="font-size:11pt" xml:space="preserve"> Levy, “The Wordsworths, the Greens,” 542.</hi></p></note></hi>
                This led to significant friction with Coleridge, who questioned both the belief that
                the subscription should be capped and the Wordsworths’ decision to sell the entire
                contents of the Greens’ cottage. Other hints of worry over possible unintended
                consequences of assisting the family occur in the “Narrative.” Dorothy, for
                instance, notes the initial concerns of some genteel women who housed the children
                before their placement in new homes. Fears had been expressed that “wayward desires”
                in the children might be raised “by the luxuries among which they had lived for the
                last three weeks.” While Dorothy expresses her relief (and that of the other women)
                “that [their] fears that this might happen were ill-grounded,” the articulation of
                this worry is in itself revealing.</p>
            <p>The Wordsworths were far from unassisted in supervising the collection of funds and
                the placement and upbringing of the Green children. The rector of Grasmere, the
                Reverend Thomas Jackson, agreed to act as trustee, and George Mackereth, the parish
                clerk, was appointed official collector. Six local women—Mrs. Watson (the wife of
                the Bishop of Llandaff), Mrs. Lloyd (wife of author Charles Lloyd), Mrs. King and
                Mrs. North (both recent settlers in the neighborhood), a Miss Knot, and William’s
                wife, Mary—were appointed to superintend the collection of subscriptions, administer
                the funds collected, and oversee the care of the children in their new homes. For
                the next 21 years, until the youngest Green children were able to support
                themselves, the trustees distributed the funds to the families who had taken in the
                younger orphaned children, deservedly earning Ernest de Sélincourt’s praise as “a
                model of a simple act of charity wisely conceived and scrupulously administered.”<hi

                archives from the woman-led effort to finance the children’s schooling, medical
                care, and clothing allow historians to piece together a vivid portrait of the care
                of these children. Dorothy’s “Narrative” in particular demonstrates how the work of
                charity and caregiving was largely a female endeavor. </p>
            <p>For the most part, these women worked harmoniously in the service of the children.
                Susan Levin has described Dorothy’s story as “an affirmation of a certain mode of
                social assistance” and a “positive description of a community in which experience
                and relation of that experience almost conflate.”<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note

                Wolfson, Dorothy’s general “social sensibility” throughout her prose and poetic
                works, including the “Narrative,” differentiates her writing from William’s “more
                solitary poetics.”<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note place="end"

                Nevertheless, in the “Narrative,” Dorothy cannot help criticizing one Mrs North, who
                    “<hi rend="strikethrough">cannot do a charitable action without the pleasure of
                    being busy</hi>.” As this strikethrough suggests, Dorothy censors herself,
                deleting her bitter complaints and canceling her antagonist’s name. Elsewhere in the
                manuscript she writes, “I will not blemish a narrative of events so moving, which
                have brought forward so many kind and good feelings, by entering into the cabals and
                heart-burnings of M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi>
                <hi rend="strikethrough">North.</hi>” Throughout DCMS 64, Mrs. North’s name is
                completely erased, revealing that Dorothy was sufficiently concerned about the
                circulation of the “Narrative” to accentuate discretion as well as an impression of
                local solidarity.</p>
            <p>B. Dorothy as Social Historian</p>
            <p>The “Narrative” is a remarkable work of local history, one that utilizes Dorothy’s
                talents as a precise and compassionate recorder of speech and events. Both a keen
                observer of and a participant in this crisis, she brings the perspectives of both an
                outsider and an insider: an outsider in that the Greens, as poor farmers, belonged

                Cottage at the foot of Blentern Gill”—is one of many nods to a knowing audience
                familiar with Grasmere and its environs (see fig. 4.1). While implicitly directed
                toward a broader, if still localized, readership, the more specific addressee of the
                “Narrative” appears to have been Dorothy’s good friend Catherine Clarkson. The
                Clarksons urged Dorothy to publish the “Narrative,” and a complete manuscript copy
                of the text remains in the Clarkson papers at the British Library.<hi
                    rend="endnote_reference"><note place="end"><p rend="endnote text">

                Dorothy draws her anticipated readers into the story, inviting them directly to feel
                compassion for the Greens (“You will wonder how they lived at all and indeed I can
                scarcely tell you”), to participate in the unfolding of events (“It would not be
                easy to give you an idea of the suspense and trouble in every face before the bodies
                were found”), and to identify with the charitable actions of those who came to the
                aid of the orphans (“You will not wonder, after what I have said, that we have been
                anxious to preserve these Orphans”). In this way, Dorothy assumes sympathetic
                readers, though at moments she acknowledges a gap between her own feelings and those
                of readers like the Clarksons who lived outside the Grasmere community: “I cannot
                give <hi rend="underline">you</hi> the same feelings that <hi rend="underline"
                    >I</hi> have of them as neighbours and fellow-inhabitants of this Vale;
                therefore what is in my mind a full and living picture will be to you but a feeble
                sketch.”</p>
            <p>Dorothy’s “Narrative” also assumes a readership familiar with and concerned about the
                fate of small landowners like the Greens who, despite their tireless labor, could
                barely subsist on their land. She describes the Greens as being</p>
            <p>the poorest People in the Vale, though they had a small estate of their own, and a
                Cow. This morsel of Land, now deeply mortgaged had been in the possession of the
                Family for generations, and they were loth to part with it: consequently, they had
                never had any assistance from the Parish. </p>
            <p>Dorothy offers many examples of their extreme poverty—how George Green, age 65, had
                to do odd jobs for neighbors and dig peat from his own land; how the children were
                hired out to work for local families; how, after their parents’ deaths, the orphans
                were found with no money, little food, and apparently on the edge of starvation: </p>
            <p>They must very soon have parted with their Land if they had lived; for their means
                were reduced by little and little till scarcely anything <hi rend="underline"
                    >but</hi> the <hi rend="underline">Land</hi> was left. The Cow was grown old;
                and they had not money to buy another; they had sold their horse; and were in the
                habit of carrying any trifles <hi rend="strikethrough">that</hi> they could spare
                out of house or stable to barter for potatoes or meal. Luxuries they had none—they
                never made tea, and when the Neighbours went to look after the Children they found
                nothing in the house but two boiling potatoes, a very little meal, a little bread,
                and three or four legs of lean dried mutton. </p>
            <p>In such descriptions, Dorothy revisits an archetype that had figured in her journals
                and her brother’s poetry—“Michael: A Pastoral Poem” being the best example of the
                story of a small landowner (or statesman, as they were called) at risk of losing his
                land. Michael is forced to make a heartbreaking decision between selling his land
                and sending his son, Luke, to work in the city. Ultimately choosing the latter
                proves both a terrible and futile decision, terrible because Luke becomes dissipated
                and never returns home, and futile because after his parents’ deaths “the estate /
                Was sold, and went into a stranger’s hands”;<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note

                thus, both Luke and the land are lost. In a journal entry for 18 May 1800, Dorothy
                records a conversation with her neighbor, John Fisher, who similarly describes the
                extinction of the class of small landowners: “He talked much about the alteration in
                the times, &amp; observed that in a short time there would be only two ranks of
                people, the very rich &amp; the very poor, for those who have small estates says he
                are forced to sell, &amp; all the land goes into one hand.”<hi

                situated and equally tragic: they represented the passing away of a “pastoral” life
                (to use William’s subtitle), one that seemed increasingly under threat. It may be
                that drawing the plight of these families to public notice was “the work” that
                Thomas Clarkson had in mind in urging Dorothy to publish the narrative; a request
                that prompted her well-known reply to Catherine Clarkson, on 9 December 1810,
                discussed in detail below.<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note place="end"><p

                <head><hi rend="normalweight" style="font-size:12pt" xml:space="preserve">How much did the Wordsworths know about the Greens’ poverty prior to their deaths, and were they willfully blind to it? In a 2003 essay, “The Wordsworths, the Greens, and the Limits of Sympathy,” I explored the social commentary in the “Narrative,” in particular Dorothy’s representation of the Greens’ poverty and the nature and circumstances of the subscription raised for the children. Two of the main claims advanced in the essay relate to Dorothy’s representation and treatment of the poor. Although Dorothy insists on a number of occasions that she and her family were unaware of the Greens’ extreme deprivation—“Alas!,” she writes at one point, “we gained our knowledge [of their extreme poverty] since their death”—the “Narrative” also betrays a sense of personal and collective guilt over having, perhaps willfully, ignored so many warning signs. The Wordsworths possibly felt culpable, having had one of the older girls, Sally Green, in their service at the time of the tragedy. They knew, as Dorothy notes in the text, that “one of the little Girls, our own Sally or another, used to come to fetch [our used tea leaves] two long miles!” Just before the tragedy, the Wordsworths had insisted that the Greens purchase Sally two new shifts, or smocks, to fit her out for service in their house, an expense Dorothy subsequently realized must have caused great hardship. </hi></head>

                        rend="normalweight underline" style="font-size:12pt">Stiff,</hi><hi
                        rend="normalweight" style="font-size:12pt">’ unwilling to receive favours

                    >had</hi><hi rend="normalweight" style="font-size:12pt" xml:space="preserve"> money.” These remarks suggest the impossible situation that families like the Greens found themselves in: paying their debts subjected them to being called prideful; yet no doubt they would have been subject to worse insults if they had not paid. In an age when accepting charity was considered a sign of weakness, one can see how the Greens were in a hopeless predicament. Dorothy is therefore at pains to demonstrate the Greens’ worthiness, an effort to meet the standard that had been set for the deserving poor (one that is also found in William’s short narrative used to raise funds for the orphans; see appendix A). In William’s narrative, compassion for the children is “more deeply felt,” and “a general desire that more than ordinary exertions should be made” prevails because of the parents’ “frugality and industry” and “even cheerful endurance of extreme poverty.” In Dorothy’s account, she seems less willing to describe the Greens’ suffering as evidence of moral strength, perhaps reflecting her own conflicted views about the treatment of the poor generally, and about her family’s treatment of the Greens specifically. Indeed, in the most significant set of deletions in the “Narrative,” she cancels several lines that embody this understanding of the Greens as willingly suffering the burden of poverty:</hi></head>

                <p>As noted previously, Dorothy writes the “Narrative” as a local historian,
                    describing a village and way of life in which she is embedded and about which
                    she can be neither objective nor disinterested. She documents the mourning of an
                    entire community. Not only does she relate her own knowledge of the Greens prior
                    to the tragedy as well as that of others who knew them, but she also describes
                    the affecting scenes of the children’s grief upon learning the fate of their
                    parents and their struggles in settling into strange new homes. Much of what the
                    “Narrative” includes consists of what Dorothy describes as the “fireside talk in
                    our Cottages”; it is in such domestic settings, she writes, that one hears “the
                    inner histories of Families, their lesser and greater cares, their peculiar
                    habits, and ways of life [that] are recorded in the breasts of their
                    Fellow-inhabitants of the Vale.” In recording this “fireside talk,” Dorothy
                    becomes the voice of the community, situating herself within a fellowship that
                    not only rallies behind the orphans but also implicitly questions whether the
                    village could have done more to help the family before the parents’ death.
                    Dorothy’s “Narrative” evokes the shared locality in which they live: Easedale,
                    where the Greens made their home and the Wordsworths frequently rambled; the
                    nearby fells upon which the Greens met their fate; the local homes into which
                    the orphans are taken, temporarily and permanently. Dorothy is also very much
                    present throughout the “Narrative” as a character who experiences and expresses
                    the sympathy on which the story turns. In reflecting on the place where the
                    Greens were lost, she recalls her own experience “at the top of Blea Crag above
                    Easedale Tarn, that very spot where I myself had sate down <hi
                        rend="superscript">&lt;three&gt;</hi> six years ago, unable to see a yard
                    before me, or to go a step further over the Crags.” Anyone, she suggests, might
                    have shared the Greens’ fate, as a mountain-walker like Dorothy had special
                    cause to know. </p>
                <p>Dorothy’s sympathetic connection to the Greens must also have been related to her
                    own status as an orphan: Dorothy and William (and their three brothers Richard,
                    John, and Christopher) were, like the Green children, bereft of their parents at
                    young ages: their mother died in 1778 and their father in 1783. Dorothy and
                    William, again like the Greens, were sent to different relatives after the
                    deaths of their parents, not seeing each other for nine years. By 1808, Dorothy
                    had been reunited with her brother for nearly a decade, yet she must have keenly
                    understood the pain felt by the Green siblings, many of whom were separated
                    though most of them, happily, remained in the same vale. Only the eldest boy,
                    George (age 10), was placed with a relative, a half-brother in Ambleside; the
                    rest of the younger Green children joined new families. Since, as Dorothy notes,
                    “It had been declared with one voice by the people of the Parish, men and women,
                    that the Infant and her [11-year-old] Sister Jane should not be parted,” they
                    were together placed with a childless couple. The two youngest boys, William
                    (age four) and Thomas (age three), both still “in petticoats,” were kept
                    together in the home of a family with grown children. John (age seven) was taken
                    in by John Fleming, a sheep farmer who had been a friend of his father. In
                    contrast to Dorothy’s own experience as an orphan, being sent to a distant home
                    in Halifax, West Yorkshire (and later to others, some welcoming and some less
                    so), the Green children were all kept close to their native vale and placed with
                    families that seemed genuinely devoted to them. As Dorothy concluded, “The
                    general feelings have been purely kind and benevolent, arising from compassion
                    for the forlorn condition of the Orphans and from a respectful regard for the
                    memory of their Parents.”</p>

                        to section II]</hi>, long after funds had been raised in aid of the Green
                    children, Dorothy’s “Narrative” was read and copied by family members and
                    friends, and from very early on, she was urged to publish it. Dorothy’s response
                    to Catherine Clarkson’s encouragement came in a letter dated 9 December 1810. It
                    is worth quoting in full, as her famous refusal—“I should detest the idea of
                    setting myself up as an Author”—is often taken out of context and
                    misconstrued:</p>
                <p>My dear Friend I cannot express what pain I feel in refusing to grant any request
                    of yours, and above all one in which dear Mr Clarkson joins so earnestly, but
                    indeed I cannot have that narrative published. My reasons are entirely
                    disconnected with myself, much as I should detest the idea of setting myself up
                    as an Author. I should not object on that score as if it had been an invention
                    of my own it might have been published without a name, and nobody would have
                    thought of me. But on account of the Family of the Greens I cannot consent.
                    Their story was only represented to the world in that narrative which was drawn
                    up for the collecting of the subscription, so far as might tend to produce the
                    end desired, but by publishing this narrative of mine I should bring the
                    children forward to notice as Individuals, and we know not what injurious effect
                    this might have upon them. Besides it appears to me that the events are too
                    recent to be published in delicacy to others as well as to the children. I
                    should be the more hurt at having to return such an answer to your request, if I
                    could believe that the story would be of that service to the work which Mr
                    Clarkson imagines. I cannot believe that it would do much for it. Thirty or
                    forty years hence when the Characters of the children are formed and they can be
                    no longer objects of curiosity, if it should be thought that any service would
                    be done, it is my present wish that it should then be published whether I am
                    alive or dead.<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note place="end"><p

                <p>Dorothy’s sensitivity to the children’s privacy trumps even the request of her
                    dear friends, the Clarksons, and seems driven by concern that the orphaned
                    children might be harmed, their story sensationalized. </p>
                <p>Over thirty years after the deaths of George and Sarah Green, in 1839, Thomas De

                    Quincey recollects that, after returning from a visit to the Lakes to Oxford in
                    1808, he received a letter from Dorothy “asking for any subscriptions [he] might
                    succeed in obtaining, amongst [his] college friends, in aid of the funds then
                    raising in behalf of an orphan family, who had become such by an affecting
                    tragedy that had occurred within a few weeks from [his] visit to Grasmere.”<hi
                        rend="endnote_reference"><note place="end"><p rend="endnote text">
                                <hi style="font-size:11pt">De Quincey, “Sketches of Life and
                                    Manners,” 1:569.</hi>
                            </p></note></hi> Alluding to Dorothy’s as-yet-unpublished “Narrative,”
                    he describes how “Miss Wordsworth’s simple but fervid memoir not being within my
                    reach at this moment, I must trust to my own recollections and my own
                    impressions to retrace the story.”</p>
                <p>De Quincey proceeds with a lengthy, embellished account filled with details of
                    both the Greens’ death on the fells and of the children’s patient suffering that
                    are not included in Dorothy’s account. It is not clear how he came by these
                    details, though he did move to Grasmere in 1809, so it is possible he heard them
                    from witnesses. Nevertheless, De Quincey transforms the narrative into
                    melodrama. He describes how the Greens had been strongly warned against
                    returning home via Langdale Fell, a point never mentioned in Dorothy’s account,
                    and comments: “After this they were seen no more. They had disappeared into the
                    cloud of death.” He also invents the mounting fears of the soon-to-be-orphaned
                    Green children, imagining how “Every sound, every echo amongst the hills, was
                    listened to for five hours, from seven to twelve.” Further adding a gothic flair
                    to the tale, he writes, “Some time in the course of the evening—but it was late,
                    and after midnight—the moon arose, and shed a torrent of light upon the Langdale
                    fells, which had already, long before, witnessed in darkness the death of their
                    parents.”</p>
                <p>Dorothy, in contrast, describes the children patiently waiting, reasonably
                    assuming their parents had stayed overnight in Langdale due to the weather.
                    Whereas Dorothy’s account evidences a deep communal and human connection to the
                    Greens, De Quincey’s treats this family catastrophe as an occasion for
                    overwrought storytelling. At one point, in fact, he confesses to having
                    entertained a party of American visitors “by conducting them through Grasmere
                    into the little inner chamber of Easedale, and there, within sight of the
                    solitary cottage, Blentarn Ghyll, telling them the story of the Greens.”<hi

                    friend De Quincey exploited the Greens’ fate much in the way Dorothy feared. </p>
                <p>Dorothy’s account thus remains the most reliable account of this Lakeland
                    tragedy, providing extensive details about the lives of the Green family before
                    the death of the parents, the events surrounding their deaths, and the
                    community’s response. In addition to being the most informative, it is the least
                    romanticized of the records, and also the most poignant.</p>

                <p>The diplomatic transcription of the “Narrative” that follows is taken from DCMS
                    64, a blue, clothbound notebook in the collections of the Wordsworth Trust.
                    Written on the cover of the notebook, in Dorothy’s hand, is the short title
                    “Narrative. The Greens 1808.” (see fig. 4.2). The notebook begins with a
                    prefatory note by William, dated 11 May 1808, explaining that the narrative was
                    “drawn up” by Dorothy at his request (fig. 4.2). William adds that he “entreated
                    that she would give a <hi rend="underline">minute detail</hi> of all the
                    particulars which had come within her notice,” as a full report would better
                    answer “the end for which the account was written . . . viz. that of leaving
                    behind a record of human sympathies, and moral sentiments, either as they were
                    called forth or brought to remembrance” by the tragic deaths of George and Sarah
                    Green in March. On the first page of the “Narrative,” Dorothy provides the full
                    title as “A Narrative concerning George &amp; Sarah Green of the Parish of
                    Grasmere addressed to a Friend.” The notebook contains thirty leaves, and the
                    page size varies slightly, averaging approximately 240mm x 190mm (h x w). The
                    notebook appears to have been made by a stationer, as the paper board cover is
                    original (fig. 4.2).</p>

                <p>Dorothy’s “Narrative” fills the entire rest of the notebook now catalogued as
                    DCMS 64. She paginated it from page 2 to the end of the “Narrative” on page 43.
                    After a few blank leaves following the end of the main
                    text<hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">, </hi>she added four pages of notes.
                    As may be seen in figure 4.1, a representative page, the copy is largely fair,
                    suggesting that she was probably working from a previous draft, but there are
                    considerable revisions throughout. In our digital edition, the text is presented
                    as a diplomatic transcription that respects as much as possible the text and
                    layout of the original (including line, paragraph, and page breaks). </p>
                <p>Dorothy’s handwritten revisions within DCMS 64 may be divided into three main
                    categories:</p>
                <list rend="numbered">
                    <item>Those she seemingly made while drafting the original or shortly
                        thereafter. All of these changes are minor and reflect immediate second
                        thoughts.</item>
                    <item>Those made in ink at a somewhat later date. Chiefly, these are
                        cancellations of lines or passages like the aforementioned complaints about
                        Mrs. North. She also cancels William and Mary’s names in one place,
                        substituting “my brother and sister.” In another, she replaces “William”
                        with “my brother.” Further, she softens some descriptions of the Greens that
                        might have been perceived as negative. These revisions and cancels are often
                        made with a noticeably darker ink.</item>
                    <item>Those made in pencil, possibly later still. For the most part, these
                        revisions are insubstantial, making minor corrections or simply recopying
                        the same words (a practice seen in Dorothy’s other manuscripts). She does,
                        however, add one substantial note in pencil, the final one, which recounts
                        the tragic death of the villager Mary Watson (see note to page 38).</item>
                </list>
                <p>In total, there are five known manuscripts of the “Narrative.” Three are
                    autograph copies, two of which are complete (DCMS 64 and British Library Add MS
                    41267) and one incomplete (DCMS 51). The remaining two (DCMS 167 and WLMSH/2/5)
                    are transcriptions made by other hands, as described in the following
                    paragraphs. All copies except the British Library autograph are held by the
                    Wordsworth Trust. We have selected DCMS 64 as our copy-text because it is
                    Dorothy’s personal copy, the one to which she returned to reread and make
                    revisions. The handwriting is fair, with most of the revisions and cancels
                    having been added later, as can be determined by the differences in ink and by
                    the nature of the revisions, most of which appear to have been made to mask the
                    identity of some of the individuals involved, for reasons of tact or clarity.
                    (Such changes were typical of Dorothy, especially when she contemplated
                    publishing her manuscript materials or sharing them with new audiences.) Dorothy
                    also added notes to the end of the “Narrative” that relate to events that took
                    place many years after 1808. If there had been a preceding draft, it has not
                    survived. </p>
                <p>The British Library (BL) copy (Add MS 41267), part of the Clarkson Papers
                    collection, is almost entirely fair, written in a neat hand with very few
                    revisions. Like DCMS 64, it is dated 4 May 1808, but it seems unlikely that
                    Dorothy completed this copy on the same day as she did DCMS 64, meaning she
                    likely just reproduced the date from DCMS 64. As the BL catalogue entry notes,
                    Catherine Clarkson is probably the “friend” mentioned in the title and the
                    original dedicatee of the narrative. At the end of a letter dated 9 February
                    1812, Clarkson writes to Dorothy, “Don’t forget your promise of giving me a copy
                    of your Narrative in your own hand-writing.”<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note
                            place="end"><p rend="endnote text"

                            </p></note></hi> Clarkson had certainly read a copy of the “Narrative”
                    earlier, as is evidenced by her letter of 9 December 1810 urging Dorothy to
                    publish it, but perhaps she never had her own copy prior to 1812. The paper in
                    the BL manuscript of the <hi rend="italic">Narrative</hi> is watermarked 1808;
                    however, this tells us only that the text was copied sometime after 1808—Dorothy
                    might have had the paper for some time. So, it seems likely that the BL
                    <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Narrative </hi>was made after Clarkson’s
                    1812 request, on paper from 1808, or that Dorothy simply sent Clarkson a copy
                    she had made earlier. Some, but not all, of the revisions to DCMS 64 are
                    duplicated in the BL manuscript, suggesting either that some revisions to the
                    notebook were added after the BL copy had been made or that Dorothy did not wish
                    to retain some of the revisions in the copy. </p>
                <p>The only surviving autograph version of the “Narrative” besides DCMS 64 and the
                    BL copy is an excerpt in DCMS 51, a miscellany in which Dorothy copied various
                    poems and narratives. After including William’s inscription and four pages of
                    the “Narrative,” it ends mid-sentence in a paragraph found in the middle of page
                    5 of DCMS 64. Like the BL copy, the DCMS 51 version appears to have postdated
                    DCMS 64. It includes only one small correction, made on the first page in the
                    course of copying. It does not include any of what appear to be the later
                    revisions to DCMS 64.</p>
                <p>Our edition notes any textual discrepancies between the two complete surviving
                    autograph versions (DCMS 64 and the BL/Clarkson copy). Assuming that DCMS 64 was
                    Dorothy’s copytext for the BL version, she made minor revisions in the process
                    of transcribing. </p>
                <p>One of the two complete contemporaneous copies of the “Narrative” in other hands,
                    DCMS 167, was, according to a note at its end, “<hi rend="sectionmetadata"
                        >transcribed by Miss Fletcher now Lady Richardson</hi>.” Mary, Lady
                    Richardson (1802–1880) lived in Easedale for several years. Her mother, Mrs.
                    Mary Fletcher (1770–1858) had visited the Lakes on several occasions and in
                    1839, with the help of William Wordsworth, had purchased, with her husband,
                    Lancrigg Farm in Easedale. Her youngest daughter, Mary, who transcribed the
                    “Narrative,” lived at the farm with her parents until her marriage in 1847. It
                    is likely that her interest in the Greens’ story came about because the family’s
                    residence was near the cottage where the Greens had lived (and which remains
                    there today). As the Fletchers did not move to Easedale until 1839, the
                    “Narrative” was likely not copied until some time later, suggesting ongoing
                    interest in the story. The other con copy, WLMSH/2/5, was transcribed by Mary
                    Wordsworth’s sister Sara Hutchinson. The year in which this transcript was made
                    is not known.</p>
                <p>The number of extant copies demonstrates the significance the “Narrative” held
                    for the Wordsworths and their social circle, as a document meant to record an
                    important incident in the life of the village but also to travel widely. In
                    1839, De Quincey reports his understanding that the “Narrative” “went into the
                    hands of the royal family; at any rate, the august ladies of that house (all or
                    some of them) were amongst the many subscribers to the orphan children.”<hi

                                    of Life and Manners,” 1:569.</hi></p></note></hi> The highest
                    number of complete manuscript copies of a work by Dorothy that survives is five,
                    for the <hi rend="italic">Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland, A.D,
                        1803</hi>. However, the “Narrative” is a close second with four complete
                    manuscripts and one partial copy. In contrast, Dorothy’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Journal of a Tour of the Continent, 1820</hi> survives in only a single
                    copy, as is the case with her Grasmere journal notebooks, which were evidently
                    not meant to be shared outside of the household. </p>
                <p>A November 1850 letter from Mary Wordsworth to her sister-in-law Mary Monkhouse
                    Hutchinson establishes that the “Narrative” was still being circulated and
                    copied four decades after its composition. Midway through this letter, the
                    then-80-year-old Mary Wordsworth asks whether Monkhouse’s daughters, Elizabeth
                    and Sarah, had “ever beg[u]n to copy the Green’s Narrative and if so what they
                    did with it.” Apparently, Fanny Wordsworth, wife of William Jr., had recently
                    reported, “Eliz. was about it when she was at Carlisle, and Sarah talked of
                    doing it at the Cooksons.” Since, as Mary Wordsworth explains, the Green “family
                    have applied again for it,” her recently deceased husband’s long-time clerk,
                    John Carter, “is ready to make them a Copy, if he hears one is not in
                        forwardness.”<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note place="end"><p
                                rend="endnote text">
                                <hi rend="italic" style="font-size:11pt">LMW</hi><hi
                                    style="font-size:11pt">, 326.</hi></p></note></hi> The copy
                    eventually sent to the Greens, the present whereabouts of which are unknown, was
                    passed down from John Green—a seven-year-old at the time of his parents’
                    death—to his granddaughter, who wrote about her possession of it in a letter to
                    the Wordsworths’ descendants. </p>
                <p>Dorothy would have been highly gratified to have known of the Greens’ fondness
                    for her “Narrative,” for she had always believed that those who had personal
                    knowledge of the subjects of her writing would be most appreciative of it. This
                    philosophy of writing was one of the reasons she published so little of what she
                    wrote and sometimes struggled to revise her work (like the Scotch tour) to ready
                    it for a wider, public audience. As she told Catherine Clarkson, she supported
                    the publication of the “Narrative” after the Green children were grown and out
                    of danger of exploitation, and so would probably have approved of Ernest de
                    Sélincourt publishing the first print edition of the “Narrative” in 1936. Though
                    much more time had passed than the “thirty or forty years” Dorothy had asked for
                    it to remain private, she had no objections, as noted previously, to its
                    publication, provided that “it should be thought that any service would be
                        done.”<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note place="end"><p>
                                <hi style="font-size:11pt">See n16.</hi></p></note></hi> William, in
                    his prefatory inscription to the “Narrative,” makes explicit what this service
                    is: “that of leaving behind a record of human sympathies, and moral sentiments,
                    either as they were called forth or brought to remembrance, by a distressful
                    event.”</p>
