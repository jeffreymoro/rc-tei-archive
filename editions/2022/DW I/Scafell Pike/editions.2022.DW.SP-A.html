                  “Scawfell Excursion”
                   in DCMS 51 features edits in both pen and pencil. Previous editors have assumed that
                  the pencil marks are William Wordsworth’s, noting that many of these changes appeared
                  in the version published in the third edition of his <em>Guide to the Lakes</em> (1823).

                           corrections made by Dorothy while she was in the process of making her own extract
                           from her letter to Johnson and corrections made a few years later when the 1822 Guide
                           was being prepared” (Prose, 2:362). This is, as they say, “usually” true, but not
                           always.</span></div>
                  </div> This theory is plausible; however, both William and Dorothy appear to have undertaken
                  multiple rounds of edits between 1818 and the text’s 1822 publication, and it is difficult
                  to tell which edits belong to which hand. The diplomatic transcription that follows
                  therefore aims to include all markings, including lines and symbols for deletions
                  or insertions that are difficult to reproduce typographically. Unfortunately, the
                  final page of DCMS 51 is badly torn. For the missing text, readers must consult a
                  second manuscript source, which we refer to as the <em><a class="link_ref" href="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.SP-B">Kenyon Transcript</a></em>. For more on DCMS 51, see the  <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.SP-intro">section introduction</a></p>

               she writes “Stonethwaite,” cancels it, and replaces it with “Seathwaite.” The Kenyon
               Transcript has “Stonethwaite” in this position, suggesting that DW made the mistake
               in the original letter to Johnson. By contrast, the 1822 <em>Guide</em> has “Seathwaite,” making the appropriate correction.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note22_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note23"><span class="noteLabel">23. </span><span class="noteBody">DW’s punctuation is confusing through this section of dialogue. She probably intends
               something like what De Sélincourt offers in <em>DWJ</em>. However, De Sélincourt’s editing procedure is mysterious. He appears to use DCMS
               51 as his base text, but if that is the case, he presumably depends on another manuscript
               for all of the material from “It is a Ship” to “our far distant friend in S. Wales,
               Miss Hutchinson“—text missing from the torn notebook page. He might turn to the Kenyon
               Transcript, but some of his readings differ slightly from that witness. For instance,
               he ends with “Miss Hutchinson” where the Kenyon Transcript has “Sara Hutchinson”;
               he has “I hope, when again inclined to positiveness, I may remember” where the Keynon
               Transcript has “I hope when I am again inclined to positiveness, I may remember.”
               Finally, De Sélincourt has “submissiveness” where the Kenyon Transcript has “submission.”
               Are these mistakes? Silent emendations? Did De Sélincourt have access to a manuscript
               that has since been lost? Or, alternately, was the torn last page of DCMS 51 still
               intact when he did his work? Even that last circumstance would not explain all the
               variants, as DCMS 51 clearly has “Sara Hutchinson” rather than “Miss Hutchinson.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note23_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
