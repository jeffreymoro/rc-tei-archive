                     had been made in the work it was abandoned from a conviction, that, if well executed,

               <p>Having left Rossthwaite in Borrowdale, on a bright morning in the first week of October,
                  we ascended from Seathwaite to the top of the ridge, called Ash-course, and thence
                  beheld three distinct views. On one side, the continuous Vale of Borrowdale, Keswick,
                  and Bassenthwaite,—with Skiddaw, Helvellyn, Saddleback, and numerous other mountains,—and,
                  in the distance, the Solway Frith and the Mountains of Scotland. On the other side,
                  and below us, the Langdale Pikes—their own vale below <span style="font-style:italic">them</span>; —Windermere, — and, far beyond Windermere, Ingleborough in Yorkshire. But how shall
                  I speak of the deliciousness of the third prospect! At this time, <span style="font-style:italic">that</span> was most favoured by sunshine and shade. The green Vale of Esk—deep and green, with
                  its glittering serpent stream, was below us; and, on we looked to the Mountains near
                  the Sea —Black Comb pre-eminent,—and, still beyond, to the Sea itself in dazzling
                  brightness. Turning round [page break] we saw the Mountains of Wastdale in tumult;
                  to our right, Great Gavel, the loftiest, a distinct, and <span style="font-style:italic">huge</span> form, though the middle of the mountain was, to our eyes, as its base.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>We had attained the object of this journey; but our ambition now mounted higher. We
                     saw the summit of Scaw-fell, apparently very near to us; and we shaped our course
                     towards it; but, discovering that it could not be reached without first making a considerable
                     descent, we resolved, instead, to aim at another point of the same mountain, called
                     the <span style="font-style:italic">Pikes</span>, which I have since found has been estimated as higher than the summit bearing the
                     name of Scawfell Head,

                  <p>The sun had never once been overshadowed by a cloud during the whole of our progress
                     from the centre of Borrowdale: — on the summit of the Pike, which we gained after
                     much toil though without difficulty, there was not a breath of air to stir even the
                     papers containing our refreshment, as they lay spread out upon a rock. The stillness
                     seemed to be not of this world: — we paused, and kept silence to listen; and no sound
                     could be heard: the Scawfell [page break] Cataracts were voiceless to us; and there was not an insect to hum in the air. The
                     vales which we had seen from Ash-course lay yet in view; and, side by side with Eskdale,
                     we now saw the sister Vale of Donnerdale terminated by the Duddon Sands. But the majesty
                     of the mountains below, and close to us, is not to be conceived. We now beheld the
                     whole mass of Great Gavel from its base,—the Den of Wastdale at our feet— a gulph
                     immeasurable: Grasmire and the other mountains of Crummock— Ennerdale and its mountains;
                     and the Sea beyond! Gladly

                              Pike, and the Styhead Pass. It disappeared from the 1820 River Duddon version of the

                     such a supply of delicious water as we might have procured, had we been on the rival
                     summit of Great Gavel; for on its highest point is a small triangular receptacle of
                     water in the native rock, which, the shepherds say, is never dry. There, we might
                     have slaked our thirst plenteously with a pure and celestial beverage, for the cup
                     or basin, it appears, has no other feeder than the dews of heaven, the showers, the
                     vapours, the hoar frost, and the spotless snow. [page break]</p>
               </div>
               <p>While we were gazing around, “Look,” I exclaimed, “at yon ship upon the glittering
                  sea!” “Is it a Ship?” replied our Shepherd-guide. “It can be nothing else,” interposed
                  my companion; “I cannot be mistaken, I am so accustomed to the appearance of Ships
                  at sea.” The Guide dropped the argument; but, before a minute was gone, he quietly
                  said, “Now look at your Ship; it is changed into a Horse.” So indeed it was,—a horse
                  with a gallant neck and head. We laughed heartily; and, I hope, when again inclined
                  to be positive, I may remember the Ship and the Horse upon the glittering Sea; and
                  the calm confidence, yet submissiveness, of our wise Man of the Mountains, who certainly
                  had more knowledge of clouds than we, whatever might be our knowledge of ships. </p>
               <p>I know not how long we might have remained on the summit of the Pike, without a thought
                  of moving, had not our guide warned us that we must not linger; for a storm was coming.
                  We looked in vain to espy the signs of it. Mountains, vales, and sea were touched
                  with the clear light of the sun. “It is [page break] there,” he said, pointing to
                  the sea beyond Whitehaven, and there we perceived a light vapour unnoticeable but
                  by a Shepherd accustomed to watch all mountain bodings. We gazed around again, and
                  yet again, unwilling to lose the remembrance of what lay before us in that lofty solitude;
                  and then prepared to depart. Meanwhile the air changed to cold, and we saw that tiny
                  vapour swelled into mighty masses of cloud which came boiling over the mountains.
                  Great Gavel, Helvellyn, and Skiddaw, were wrapped in storm; yet Langdale, and the
                  mountains in that quarter, remained all bright in sunshine. Soon the storm reached
                  us; we sheltered under a crag; and almost as rapidly as it had come it passed away,
                  and left us free to observe the struggles of gloom and sunshine in other quarters.
                  Langdale now had its share, and the Pikes of Langdale were decorated by two splendid
                  Rainbows; Skiddaw also had its own Rainbows. Before we again reached Ash-course every
                  cloud had vanished from every summit.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>I ought to have mentioned that round the top of Scawfell PIKE not a blade of grass
                     is to [page break] be seen. A few cushions or tufts of moss, parched and brown, appear between the huge
                     blocks and stones that lie in heaps on all sides to a great distance, like skeletons
                     or bones of the earth not needed at the creation, and there left to be covered with
                     never-dying lichens, which the clouds and dews nourish; and adorn with colours of
                     vivid and exquisite beauty. Flowers, the most brilliant feathers,

                     </div> and even gems, scarcely surpass in colouring some of those masses of stone, which
                     no human eye beholds, except the Shepherd or Traveller be led thither by curiosity:
                     and how seldom must this happen! For the other Eminence is the one visited by the
                     adventurous Traveller; and the Shepherd has no inducement to ascend the PIKE in quest
                     of his Sheep; for no food is <span style="font-style:italic">there</span> to tempt them.</p>
               </div>
               <p>We certainly were singularly favoured in the weather; for when we were seated on the
                  summit, our Conductor, turning his eyes thoughtfully round, said, “I do not know that
                  in my whole life, I was ever, at any season of the year, so high upon the mountains
                  on so calm a day.” (It was the 7th of October.) Afterwards we had the storm, which
                  exhibited the grandeur of [page break] the earth and heavens commingled; yet without
                  terror. We knew that it would pass away; — for so our prophetic Guide had assured
                  us.</p>
               <p>Before we reached Seathwaite in Borrowdale, a few stars had appeared, and we pursued
                  our way down the Vale, to Rossthwaite, by moonlight. </p>
