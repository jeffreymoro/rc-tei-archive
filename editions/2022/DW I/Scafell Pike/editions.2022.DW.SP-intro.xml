               <p>This section of our edition features Dorothy Wordsworth&#8217;s account of climbing Scafell Pike,
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">&#8220;Scaw Fell&#8221; and &#8220;Scawfell&#8221; were common spellings in DW&#8217;s time, but today the accepted
                    form is &#8220;Scafell Pike.&#8221;</note> England&#8217;s highest mountain, in 1818. A revised and abbreviated version of the text appeared under
                    her brother William&#8217;s name in his <title level="m">Description of the Scenery of the Lakes in the North of England</title> (1822), 
                    the first stand-alone edition of the work, now commonly known as Wordsworth&#8217;s <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> (figs. 5.1 and 5.2).
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors"><title level="m">A Description of the Scenery of the Lakes in the North of England</title> (1822) was the third printing of WW&#8217;s essay
                    but the first in the form of a guidebook. On the textual history of Wordsworth&#8217;s <title level="m">Guide</title>, see the 2015
                    <ref target="/editions/guide_lakes">Romantic Circles digital critical edition</ref>, ed. Mason, Westover, and Stimpson.</note> <!--add anchor in the guide!!-->
                    Since subsequent editions of William&#8217;s <title level="m">Guide</title> continued to present her description of the ascent as his, Dorothy&#8217;s authorship was not broadly
                    acknowledged until 1941, when Ernest de Sélincourt included the full text in his important edition of her journals.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors"><title level="a">Excursion up Scawfell Pike</title> is the final item in De Sélincourt&#8217;s 
                    <title level="m">DWJ</title>, vol. 1 (423&#8211;30). De Sélincourt had earlier described and quoted from <title level="a">Excursion</title> in his 1933 
                    <title level="m">DWB</title> (313&#8211;16), but this was the first time the text was presented in full.</note></p>
                
               <p>In the <title level="m">Guide</title>, William introduced Dorothy&#8217;s narrative as an &#8220;extract from a letter to a Friend.&#8221;
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">WW&#8217;s &#8220;extract from a letter&#8221; explanation first appeared in the

                    While this attribution was technically accurate, as Dorothy did send the account in a letter to their mutual friend, 
                    the Reverend William Johnson, William never mentioned that the source was his sister&#8217;s letter, leaving readers to assume that he was its author. 
                    Later writers of travel books, drawing on the <title level="m">Guide</title>, enthusiastically quoted Dorothy&#8217;s language as if it were William&#8217;s and supposed that 
                    he had made the climb. For over a century, then, devotees of the poet intent on emulating his ascent remained unaware that it was, in fact, Dorothy&#8217;s 
                    footsteps that they were retracing.</p>

              <p>Dorothy&#8217;s description of her ascent, which De Sélincourt called <title level="a">Excursion up Scawfell Pike,</title> is remarkable for at least two related reasons. 
                    First, it is a landmark in the history of British mountaineering&#8212;one of the earliest reports of a recreational climb of Scafell Pike (3,209 ft., or 978 m) 
                    and the first by a woman.<note place="foot" resp="editors">DW&#8217;s account of climbing Scafell Pike was not quite the first. In <title level="m">The Tourist&#8217;s New Guide</title> (1819), 
                    William Green described summiting the mountain with Jonathan Otley in September 1816 and noted that Otley had already done so with Edward Birkett in June 1815 (2:318&#8211;26).
                    If, as Green claims, he began writing his book in late 1816 and printing it in 1817 (1:vii), his account predated DW&#8217;s. It was certainly first in print, as DW&#8217;s 
                    did not appear until 1822.</note> Second, it captures an aspect of Dorothy&#8217;s life that has sometimes been overlooked. Dorothy Wordsworth was a prodigious walker&#8212;this
                    fact is well known&#8212;but her pioneering achievements as a mountaineer have insufficiently shaped the public&#8217;s memory of her.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Happily, recent scholarship has helped bring DW&#8217;s mountaineering into view. See especially Simon Bainbridge&#8217;s 
                    <title level="m">Mountaineering and British Romanticism</title>, chapter 7.</note> <title level="a">Excursion</title> helps us reimagine Dorothy on the fells,
                    representing one of her most dramatic walks in the vibrant prose for which she is famous.</p>
                
              <p>Of course, recovering Dorothy&#8217;s place in mountaineering history requires bringing her <title level="a">Excursion</title> out of the shadow of her brother&#8217;s writing.
                    One admirer subtly pointed this out in 1855, the year of Dorothy&#8217;s death. In a letter to the editor of the <title level="m">Kendal Mercury</title>, venerable mountain guide 
                    Jonathan Otley hinted that there was more to tell about the now-famous Scafell Pike adventure: &#8220;The story of the ascent of Scawfell, in Wordsworth&#8217;s Guide, said in some
                    former editions to be extracted from a letter to a friend; and in the last edition from a letter by a friend, is well told, and is good as far as it goes; but it might have been 
                    improved by a prefatory introduction, and extended by an appendix.&#8221;<note place="foot" resp="editors">Appearing in the 26 May 1855 issue under the anagrammatic
                    pen name &#8220;Anthony Loajet,&#8221; Otley&#8217;s <title level="m">Kendal Mercury</title> letter was occasioned by the recent publication of Harriet Martineau&#8217;s
                    <title level="m">Complete Guide to the English Lakes</title>. Although he did not say so, he must have known that DW (recently deceased) was the 
                    letter-writing &#8220;friend.&#8221; The textual change he mentions occurred in the second and third editions of Hudson&#8217;s

                    but added supplementary materials.</note> Our introduction and editorial apparatus should perform the record-expanding services that Otley imagined, 
                    restoring a historic experience and its documentation to the rightful owner: Dorothy Wordsworth.</p>

            <p>On Wednesday, 7 October 1818, Dorothy Wordsworth (age 46) and her friend Mary Barker (age 44) climbed Scafell Pike, the highest mountain in England. 
                  They were joined by a shepherd-guide (John Allison, Barker&#8217;s neighbor), a porter, and Barker&#8217;s maid (Agnes)&#8212;none of whom were named in Dorothy&#8217;s account of 
                  the adventure.<note place="foot" resp="editors">We owe the names of John Allison (1787&#8211;1855) and Agnes to Otley, who includes them in the 
                  <title level="m">Kendal Mercury</title> letter previously cited. Otley was unreliable in some details, but he knew the people concerned and was 
                  sound in his basic recollections. While the names of the maid and guide do not appear in DW&#8217;s narrative, we include them in part to counteract the tendency to
                  mythologize writer-mountaineers while overlooking those who accompanied them and helped make their accomplishments possible. Agnes was obviously a fit and trusted 
                  companion for Mary Barker, though we know little more about her. Perhaps John Allison was no Tenzing Norgay, but he deserves honorable mention in the history of 
                  British mountaineering alongside other shepherd-guides of the early days. About the unnamed porter, unfortunately, we know nothing at all.
                  <p>Regarding Agnes, see various letters of SH and DW&#8217;s own <title level="m">Journal of a Tour on the Continent</title> (1820), in which she reports on 
                  visiting Mary Barker at Boulogne. At this reunion, the party &#8220;had Borrowdale Agnes to wait upon us, a little frenchified in exterior,
                  it is true, but retaining her good Cumberland speech&#8221; (<title level="m">DWJ</title>, 2:331). John Allison&#8217;s life is otherwise documented. 
                  His grave marker survives at St. Andrew&#8217;s Churchyard, Stonethwaite. Fittingly, given his occupation, the stone features a ram and ewe with their 
                  lambs and the inscription &#8220;Jesus Saith Feed My Sheep.&#8221; A brief obituary appeared in the <title level="m">Carlisle Patriot</title> 
                  for 27 January: &#8220;At Rosthwaite, in Borrowdale, John Allison, on the 22nd inst., Mr. John Allison, yeoman, aged 68.&#8221; 
                  Given that Allison and DW passed away within three days of each other in January 1855, Otley&#8217;s May letter can perhaps be understood as a tribute to both.</p></note> 
                  They walked an ambitious nine-mile loop that took the better part of a day: Dorothy reports setting out in the morning and finishing as the first stars appeared over Borrowdale.</p>
              
            <p>For Dorothy, this hike was the culmination of a season spent among brilliant associates. Her old acquaintance William Wilberforce, the statesman and abolitionist, 
                  had arrived in the Lake District with his family in late August 1818 and spent most of September at Rydal to be near the Wordsworths. Sir George and Lady Beaumont, 
                  dear friends and prominent art patrons, also visited Rydal in September.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Prior to this, the Beaumonts had been visiting mutual friends, 
                  the Marshalls, at Hallsteads on Ullswater&#8212;perhaps one reason why DW wrote to Jane Marshall on 14 October to report on recent adventures.</note> 
                  In early October, the Wilberforces decamped to nearby Keswick, where Dorothy and the Beaumonts soon joined them. (William Wordsworth, meanwhile, was occupied with political business).
                  <note place="foot" resp="editors">WW missed out on several opportunities that year due to absorption in the Westmorland election and its aftermath. In late June, John Keats 
                  tried to visit him at Rydal Mount and lamented that the older poet was out canvassing for the Lowther interest. Famously, several writers of the younger generation condemned 
                  his active engagement in Tory politics. DW, for her part, supported WW&#8217;s efforts. For accounts of DW&#8217;s Scafell Pike walk set against the context of late 1818,
                  see <title level="m">DWB</title>, chapter 16 and <title level="m">Gittings</title>, chapter 15.</note> Learning of this gathering in Keswick, Mary Barker invited 
                  the whole group to dine at her new home in Rosthwaite, Borrowdale, six miles to the south (fig. 5.3).</p>

            <p>A writer, artist, and music teacher, Mary Barker had lived next door to the Robert Southey family in Keswick between 1812 and 1817. She 
                  soon became intimate with the larger &#8220;Lake Poet&#8221; circle, and in 1814, Dorothy described her to Catherine Clarkson as the epitome 
                  of &#8220;Generosity, Frankness, Sincerity, and perfect disinterestedness.&#8221;<note place="foot" resp="editors">In her letter to Caroline 
                  Clarkson, 24 April 1814, DW takes Barker&#8217;s part in a dispute with the Southey and Coleridge women next door. She and Barker had been nursing 
                  Basil Montagu junior together for several weeks, and this had been an important season for the solidification of their 
                  friendship (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 3:137&#8211;44).</note> Dorothy also mentioned her friend&#8217;s &#8220;warm temper&#8221; and &#8220;disdain 
                  [for concealing] her opinions.&#8221; Barker was passionate, funny, and independent.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Barker&#8217;s nicknames included &#8220;The 
                  Senhora,&#8221; &#8220;The Colonel,&#8221; and &#8220;The Major.&#8221; Gittings characterizes Barker as a &#8220;rollicking spinster&#8221; (215), and 
                  Susan Wolfson as a &#8220;gender-fluid personality&#8221; (<title level="a">Two Wordsworths,</title> 69). The most thorough biographical treatment of 
                  Barker is David Bradbury&#8217;s <title level="m">Senhora Small Fry: Mary Barker and the Lake Poets</title> (2003). Barker is a major presence in Southey&#8217;s 
                  correspondence, and she sometimes appears in footnotes to literary history as the author of a 1798 novel, <title level="m">A Welsh Story</title>; as 
                  the &#8220;Bhow Begum&#8221; of Southey&#8217;s <title level="m">The Doctor</title>; or as the writer of the satirical <title level="a">Lines Addressed to 
                  a Noble Lord [Lord Byron] by one of the Small Fry of the Lakes.</title></note></p>
                  
            <p>Though impractical,<note place="foot" resp="editors">Southey dubbed Barker&#8217;s new home &#8220;Barker&#8217;s Folly,&#8221; in part because it overtaxed her income

                  <title level="m">Romantic Circles Electronic Edition</title>). Sara Coleridge offered details in a 4 June 1819 letter: &#8220;Our friend, Miss Barker . . . [,]
                  with an annuity of 400 a year, and 1200 pounds in money . . . [,] is obliged to leave us, and a house in Borrowdale half finished (the foolish building of which,
                  has caused this temporary ruin) and retire to France to live in her Uncle&#8217;s house, at Boulogne until her annuity can pay her debts. This is the precious fruits
                  of having <hi rend="italic">a taste for magnificence</hi>. We are sorry to part with her, and so are the Wordsworths, for she was lively, sensible, and accomplished&#8221;
                  (Potter, <title level="m">Minnow among Tritons</title>, 76). Because Barker moved to Boulogne in 1819 and never returned to England, the October 1818 walk was one of the
                  last chances for her and DW to make such a memory.</note> relatively isolated, and built alongside a flood-prone branch of the River Derwent, Mary Barker&#8217;s new home was
                  nonetheless ideal for hosting friends who shared her taste for mountain scenery.<note place="foot" resp="editors">William Green mentioned Barker&#8217;s new home and its setting
                  in his <title level="m">Tourist&#8217;s New Guide</title> (1819): &#8220;On the banks of the Stonethwaite arm of the Derwent, there has recently been erected, by Miss Barker,
                  an excellent house, commanding a fine view over the river. . . . There is scarcely amongst these northern vallies, a place, in which an equally valuable collection of
                  painters&#8217; studies may be so speedily collected, as from the environs of Rosthwaite&#8221; (2:136).</note> Dorothy went there on the morning of 5 October, possibly to
                  help with preparations for the dinner. Then, on 6 October, the Wilberforce entourage and the Beaumonts made their way into Borrowdale &#8220;with store of provisions,&#8221;
                  while Barker &#8220;provided vegetables, etc.&#8221;<note place="foot" resp="editors">These details appear in DW&#8217;s letter to Jane Marshall, 14 October 1818 
                  (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 3:494&#8211;97).</note> In a period famous for its &#8220;immortal&#8221; dinners, this was a gathering worthy of remembrance.</p>
                  
            <p>In the course of conversation, the Wilberforces expressed their intent to ride up Skiddaw (3,054 ft., 931 m), the far-famed mountain overlooking Keswick, on the
                  following morning, and the Beaumonts pledged to accompany them. Wilberforce would be revisiting an ascent he made years earlier while touring the Lakes as a young
                  man. Accordingly, most of the visitors returned to Keswick for the night, looking forward to their outing, but Dorothy stayed at Rosthwaite. She and her host settled
                  on their own hiking plan. Thus, as Dorothy reports, she and Mary Barker summited Scafell Pike on the same day their friends explored Skiddaw, 14 miles to the north.
                  The Skiddaw excursion was less ambitious than the Scafell Pike ascent; still, as Wilberforce was in his late 50s and the Beaumonts in their 60s, none of them in perfect
                  health, we should admire the spirit of this group as well&#8212;not least because they got a good wetting in the rain.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The Skiddaw
                  ascent must have been a challenge for at least some of the group. William Green, who coincidentally met with the party on the mountain, left a humorous journal
                  entry in which he described Sir George Beaumont as &#8220;Sir George Breadth&#8221; (original owned by Lakeland Arts in Kendal). Green himself was now in his
                  late 50s but was still an enthusiastic walker of the fells.</note> Meanwhile, from high in the mountains above Borrowdale, Dorothy and Mary, enjoying comparatively
                  mild weather themselves, saw rainbows over Skiddaw and felt grateful that the weather had eventually cleared for their friends.</p>
            
            <p>Dorothy and Mary Barker did not at first aim to climb Scafell Pike&#8212;their original goal was to ascend Esk Hause (2,490 ft.), a high pass that on a clear day would
                  afford excellent views of the surrounding peaks and valleys. Barker, of late &#8220;an active climber of the hills,&#8221; had recently been to Esk Hause and was eager
                  to share the &#8220;magnificent prospect.&#8221;<note place="foot" resp="editors">We are indebted to Otley for this knowledge, though DW hints at it by mentioning that
                  Barker confidently promised her fantastic views from Esk Hause. On the earlier occasion, Otley reports, &#8220;Miss B. was so enraptured with the prospect that it
                  was not till her maid reminded her that the sun was going down, that she could think of leaving the place; vowing that she would visit it again ere long.&#8221;
                  She and Agnes had to find their own way down into Borrowdale, having been abandoned by their guide. At Seathwaite, they happened to meet John Allison, who promised
                  to &#8220;direct [Miss Barker] by a better route than the one by which she had descended.&#8221; Later, when DW visited, &#8220;[the friends] fixed upon an excursion,
                  and called upon Mr. Allinson [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] to redeem his promise&#8221; (<title level="m">Kendal Mercury</title>, 26 May 1855, 6).</note> However, 
                  when the friends arrived at the pass, they decided to press on. As Dorothy reports, their &#8220;spirit of enterprise&#8221; did not fail, and they climbed where, so
                  far as we can tell, few other recreational walkers had been.</p>
            
            <p>Because it was a fine day, they could see for miles in every direction. Heart-stopping views like this were relatively uncommon in an age unfamiliar with air travel and
                 satellite imagery. However, Dorothy characteristically noticed close-range features as well as the vast panorama. She observed, for instance, that the rocks were 
                 &#8220;covered with never-dying lichens . . . adorn[ed] with colours of the most vivid and exquisite beauty.&#8221; She also observed the extreme silence of the summit,
                 having had the sound of mountain streams in her ears for much of the ascent.</p>
                  
            <p>Despite her emphasis on accurate description, Dorothy explored the limits of her perceptions. Looking out from the mountain to the sea (over 12 miles away), she supposed
                 she saw a ship. &#8220;<hi rend="italic">Is</hi> it a ship?&#8221; her smiling guide asked. Barker quickly supported Dorothy&#8217;s conclusion: &#8220;A ship, yes, it can be
                 nothing else.&#8221; However, a moment later, the &#8220;ship&#8221; had become a horse, for in fact the friends had been watching a cloud. Dorothy enjoyed this joke on
                 herself, resolving to remember it when she was &#8220;again inclined to positiveness.&#8221; Like many great Romantic texts, Dorothy&#8217;s <title level="a">Excursion</title>
                 reminds us that what we see depends to some extent on prior experience, perspective, and imagination.</p>
                      
            <p>Reading Dorothy&#8217;s account, one gets the impression that she was pleased with herself, and rightly so. She remarks upon the &#8220;continuance of that 
                 vigour of body, which enabled me to climb the high mountain, as in the days of my youth&#8221; and reports that she and Barker each dashed off a 
                 triumphant letter to Sara Hutchinson
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">SH was of course the sister of WW&#8217;s wife, Mary, close to DW, and a friend also 
                 to Mary Barker. A keen mountaineer in her own right, she was an integral part of the Wordsworth circle, perhaps most famous now for being the 
                 longtime object of STC&#8217;s passion. She may be the most important shadow character in the history of DW&#8217;s Scafell Pike ascent and the writing 
                 that emerged from it. On this subject, see our speculations <ref target="#In-addition">below</ref> on DW&#8217;s memory of STC&#8217;s 1802 Scafell ascent and also our appendix on

                 (It is remarkable to think of them carrying pens, paper, and ink, if not also something to write on&#8212;no wonder they secured the help 
                 of a porter!) A week later, Dorothy wrote briefly about the experience to her old friend Jane Marshall,<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                 <ref target="bios.html#Marshall">Jane Marshall (née Pollard)</ref> and DW had been friends since their childhood days in Halifax. Jane was married to John Marshall,
                 a wealthy linen manufacturer and politician from Leeds, and now lived at Hallsteads, a fine house on the shore of Ullswater near Watermillock.</note> and a week 
                 after that she composed the longer, more circumstantial letter to William Johnson that forms (indirectly, as explained in our textual and editorial section) the 
                 basis of our edited text, speaking of the &#8220;feat&#8221; she and Barker had performed and aptly calling it an &#8220;uncommon performance.&#8221; Then, before 
                 mailing the letter, she copied it into one of her notebooks for preservation. She and her companion had broken with social convention and done something worth 
                 remembering and sharing. Part of their enjoyment, clearly, was writing about it.</p>

           <p>When Dorothy Wordsworth climbed Scafell Pike, this mountain&#8212;which had been proven to be England&#8217;s highest peak by Joseph Banks&#8217;s Trigonometrical Survey in 1790
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">Though the Trigonometrical Survey had confirmed the preeminence of Scafell Pike, it appears that the news was not yet universally
                accepted. DW and Mary Barker thought that neighboring Scafell was the higher peak and found out otherwise only after their ascent. Then, in the 
                <title level="m">Guide</title>, WW introduced DW&#8217;s account by saying that it recorded &#8220;a visit to a summit of one of the highest of these mountains,&#8221;

                popularity in recent years, the vast majority of Lake District pedestrians tended to stick to well-established routes around the central valleys.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">WW makes this point himself in <title level="m">Select Views</title>: &#8220;But it must be observed that the visits of travellers 
                are for the most part confined to the Vales of Coniston, Winandermere with the intermediate country between Ambleside and Keswick, the Vale of Keswick itself, 
                Buttermere, and Ulswater, which are the most easy of access, and indeed from their several characters most likely to repay general curiosity&#8221; 
                (iii&#8212;<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.1810.html#:~:text=of%20the%20wheel.-,4.%C2%A0,-Such%2C%20concisely%20given">  <!--put anchor wherever this leads!!-->
                para. 4</ref> in RC <title level="m">Select Views edition</title>). In short, Romantic-era visitors normally looked <hi rend="italic">up</hi> at the Lake 
                District&#8217;s mountains, and when (increasingly) they did seek out the high places, they usually climbed Skiddaw or the more challenging Helvellyn.</note> 
                Maps of the mountains included limited detail, and those enterprising tourists who did explore them generally depended on local guides. In subsequent decades,
                of course, mountain walks became common practice and guidebook staples. Scafell Pike in particular became a rite of passage for Lakeland peak-baggers. Dorothy
                and her friends played a part in bringing about this shift, though relatively few people knew this.</p>
            
           <p>The perennial challenge in studies of Dorothy Wordsworth has been her tendency to disappear, a propensity abetted by William&#8217;s habit of absorbing her work and by
                models of literary history that have undervalued the kinds of writing she did and the methods she used to share it. Readers often locate her influence indirectly,
                in poems of William&#8217;s that rework her journal entries, in letters that reveal her collaboration, and so forth, but except on occasions when William mentions her
                directly or includes her verses in his collections, it is often difficult to say, &#8220;There it is&#8212;there&#8217;s Dorothy&#8217;s mark.&#8221;</p>
                
          <p>Yet Dorothy&#8217;s mark is visible on England&#8217;s highest mountain, where walkers have unwittingly followed her footsteps for two centuries now. Almost literally, you find
               those footsteps inscribed on the landscape in the form of trails (fig. 5.4). To be sure, many aspects of trail-making are determined by practical factors unrelated
               to literary history, but Dorothy&#8217;s Scafell Pike route has endured partly because of her writing&#8217;s intersection with the nineteenth century&#8217;s multiplication of maps
               and guidebooks.</p>

           <p>Dorothy observed of Scafell Pike&#8217;s rocky summit, &#8220;No gems or flowers can surpass in colouring the beauty of some of these masses of stone which no human 
                 eye beholds except the shepherd led thither by chance or traveler by curiosity; and how seldom this must happen!&#8221;&#8212;seldom because, as she noted, 
                 sheep would find little in the rocks to eat, and because recreational fell-walking there was still in its early days. However, once Dorothy&#8217;s letter found 
                 its way into William&#8217;s <title level="m">Guide</title>, a transformative process began. By incorporating Dorothy&#8217;s ascent narrative (not far removed in genre
                 from accounts that would later appear in Alfred Wainwright&#8217;s books and on trekking websites), the <title level="m">Guide</title> made it a permanent part of
                 the tourist literature and encouraged readers to imagine and undertake their own mountain ascents.</p>
            
           <p>Just as importantly, William&#8217;s <title level="m">Guide</title> provided material that would be recycled by other travel writers. Numerous Lakeland guidebooks 
                 of the Victorian era, including Harriet Martineau&#8217;s famous <title level="m">Complete Guide</title> (fig.5.5), lingered on the <title level="m">Guide</title>&#8217;s
                 description of climbing Scafell hike. Normally, writers attributed the description to William, if they attributed it at all, but in doing so they enshrined 
                 Dorothy&#8217;s descriptive language and itinerary.<note place="foot" resp="editors">At times, DW&#8217;s text was (mis-)cited with comical results. Consider Henry S. 
                 Salt&#8217;s <title level="m">On Cambrian and Cumbrian Hills: Pilgrimages to Snowdon and Scawfell</title> (1908). Salt praises certain descriptions by poets 
                 like WW and Walter Scott but gripes that &#8220;on the whole . . . the poets have written about mountains as if they had never set foot on them, but had 
                 been content to take the panoramic &#8216;views&#8217; of them from afar&#8221; (46). As evidence, he cites WW&#8217;s <title level="m">Guide</title>: &#8220;Even
                 Wordsworth&#8217;s prose account of his ascent from Seathwaite &#8216;to the top of the ridge, called Ash Course,&#8217; makes one suspect that his real acquaintance
                 with the hills was very slight; indeed his corruption of the guide&#8217;s pronunciation of &#8216;Esk Hause&#8217; . . . into the absurdity of &#8216;Ash Course,&#8217;
                 shows that he had but little sympathetic knowledge either of the nomenclature of the hills or of the dialect of the hillmen&#8221; (46). This sort of thing can 
                 happen when you publish your sister&#8217;s work as your own; by compressing her account, you make it less nuanced. DW mentions that &#8220;Ash Course&#8221; must be 
                 a corruption of &#8220;Esk Hause&#8221; and even provides the etymology for <hi rend="italic">Hause</hi>, the normal word for a mountain saddle in the region. 
                 WW&#8217;s <title level="m">Guide</title> cuts out her chatty and interesting explanation, leaving Salt, the latter-day man of the mountains, to conclude that the 
                 poet was ignorant.</note></p>

                    best account we have of the greatest mountain excursion in England&#8221; (138).

         <p>The transmission process continued across many decades, as Dorothy&#8217;s (unacknowledged) observations were reprinted, quoted, and remembered by authors of various publications. 
               Their influence reverberated even as far as Wainwright, the patron saint of latter-day Lakeland fell-walkers, who offered his own endorsement of Dorothy&#8217;s path in 1960: 
               &#8220;Of the many routes of approach to Scafell Pike,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;this, from Borrowdale via Esk Hause, is the finest.&#8221;<note place="foot" resp="editors">Wainwright,
               <title level="m">Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells</title>, 4: Scafell Pike 18.</note> A few pages earlier, he specifically recommended the loop Dorothy and her friends 
               followed&#8212;ascent via Grains Gill, descent via Sty Head. He might have done this coincidentally, but probably not; he knew 
               Wordsworth&#8217;s <title level="m">Guide</title>.</p>
                    
         <p>Hardwicke Rawnsley, writing in <title level="m">Literary Associations of the English Lakes</title> (1894), captured both the reach and the essential irony of the reception 
               history of Dorothy&#8217;s <title level="a">Excursion.</title> Having quoted approvingly from the Scafell Pike section of the <title level="m">Guide</title> and smiled over its 
               observation (by then quaint) that few travelers summit that mountain, he concluded, &#8220;It may well be that never shall we witness such storm-grandeur as it was 
               Wordsworth&#8217;s lot to witness when, having climbed hither on a still autumn day, he was bade by his shepherd guide not to linger, for a storm was coming.&#8221;
               <note place="foot" resp="editors">Rawnsley, <title level="m">Literary Associations of the English Lakes</title>, 1:159&#8211;60.</note> Of course, 
               <hi rend="italic">William</hi> Wordsworth never did witness that storm-grandeur&#8212;in fact, he never climbed Scafell Pike at all, so far as records can tell. Rawnsley,
               like many others, assumed that he had, and his aim was to emphasize that modern pilgrims might stand where the poet had stood. After all, as Rawnsley said, &#8220;the 
               wanderer up Borrowdale and the mountains in its vicinity&#8221; will always &#8220;move&#8221; in &#8220;the company of chosen spirits.&#8221; But which spirits? In the 
               minds of many, the company has always worn trousers, but we hope our edition helps readers correctly imagine skirts and bonnets in the party.</p>

         <p>Although De Sélincourt categorized Dorothy&#8217;s Scafell Pike account with her journals, it is not a diary entry per se. This genre question deserves consideration, for 
               some of the text&#8217;s character depends on its material forms, its circulation, and its audiences.</p>
              
         <p>In conception, Dorothy&#8217;s account emerged from a cluster of letters&#8212;including, we presume, the lost one she wrote to Sara Hutchinson on top of the mountain. 
               The earliest surviving record of her ascent is her letter to Jane Marshall, dated 14 October 1818, which reads like a seed draft for the expanded report she would
               pen a week later. Dorothy expresses continued admiration for William Wilberforce (&#8220;There never lived on earth, I am sure, a man of sweeter temper&#8221;) 
               and recaps the lively 6 October dinner at Rosthwaite. &#8220;The next day,&#8221; she continues, &#8220;which was one of the finest of the year, I ascended Scaw
               Fell from Seathwaite with Miss Barker&#8212;and never before did I behold so sublime a mountain prospect.&#8221; Grateful for the weather they enjoyed, she 
               reports, &#8220;Our Guide, who is a Shepherd of Borrowdale, turning his eyes thoughtfully round when we were on the pinnacle of Scaw Fell, said &#8216;I do not 
               know that ever in the whole course of my life, I was at any season so high upon the mountains on so calm a day.&#8217; There was not a breath of wind to stir the
               very papers which we spread out with our food, when we ate our dinners on that commanding eminence.&#8221; Some of this language would reappear almost verbatim 
               in Dorothy&#8217;s final treatment of the subject.</p>
              
         <p>The experience of climbing the mountain obviously remained vivid in Dorothy&#8217;s mind. Eager to share it at length, she wrote on 21 October to the Reverend William Johnson,
               former curate and schoolmaster in Grasmere (1811&#8211;1812), who had since taken up an important teaching post in London. The original of her letter has been lost. 
               Fortunately, two copies survive, and these are our manuscript authorities for <title level="a">Excursion up Scawfell Pike.</title></p>
              
         <p>The most complete extant manuscript is Dorothy&#8217;s own backup copy: as noted previously, she transcribed her letter to Johnson into a hand-sewn notebook, which is now
               catalogued as Dove Cottage Manuscript (DCMS) 51 (fig. 5.6). Similar to DCMS 120, which preserves Dorothy&#8217;s 
               <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.Poems-intro">poetry</ref>, DCMS 51 collects literary efforts that she valued. <!--Add anchor to the Poems-intro!-->
               <title level="a">Excursion up Scawfell Pike</title> is its final item (fig. 5.7). It features both Dorothy&#8217;s edits in ink and various pencil marks, possibly
               by William, which move the text in the direction of his <title level="m">Guide</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Some of the pencil marks on DCMS 51 
               are literal scribbles&#8212;cancellations, insertion marks, and the like&#8212;while others suggest verbal revisions. It is difficult to determine who made
               the marks or when, though many of them do advance reshaping for the <title level="m">Guide</title> project, and it is likely that there are multiple layers.
               Possibly DW herself undertook adjustments at WW&#8217;s request, so we have to take care when assigning intention and responsibility.</note> Besides the obvious 
               merit of being written in Dorothy&#8217;s own hand, this manuscript also includes two important notes at the bottom of the last page: &#8220;October 21st 1818&#8221; 
               (confirming the composition date of the Johnson letter) and &#8220;Went up Scaw Fell on Wednesday the 7th October-1818.&#8221;</p>

        <p>The second surviving manuscript, described hereafter as the Kenyon Transcript, is written in an attractive, unknown hand on 
              paper watermarked 1817 (fig. 5.8). At once a letter in its own right (addressed to &#8220;Miss Hutchinson&#8221; in Wales) but otherwise 
              businesslike, with no conventional gestures of greeting or conclusion, it is actually an incomplete copy of Dorothy&#8217;s letter to Johnson. It 
              is dated &#8220;October, 1818&#8221; and bracketed entirely within quotation marks. It begins, &#8220;I must inform you of a feat that Miss 
              Barker and I performed on Wednesday the 7th of this month.&#8221; In short, it omits material that takes up more than a page of Dorothy&#8217;s 
              notebook version, including her introduction of Mary Barker and her description of the dinner at Barker&#8217;s home. As Simon Bainbridge summarizes, 
              it &#8220;edits out the first part of the original letter to focus on the ascent narrative.&#8221;<note place="foot"

             (fig. 5.9). Therefore, at least for the closing section of Dorothy&#8217;s account, the Kenyon Transcript is essential.</p>

       <p>Furthermore, the Kenyon Transcript may match the original Johnson letter more closely than the DCMS 51 copy in some respects. We suggest this because 
             DCMS 51 shows edits for style and economy that the Kenyon Transcript does not include. Derived directly from the Johnson letter (or from yet another 
             copy that has not survived), the Kenyon Transcript likely retains many original readings, despite errors in copying. Additionally, the transcript 
             includes a final paragraph that Dorothy omits in DCMS 51: &#8220;I believe that you are not much acquainted with the Scenery of this Country, except
             in the Neighbourhood of Grasmere, your duties when you were a resident here, having confined you so much to that one Vale; I hope, however, that my 
             long Story will not be very dull; and even I am not without a further hope, that it may awaken in you a desire to spend a long holiday among the Mountains,
             and explore their recesses.&#8221; No doubt this invitation was part of the original letter to Johnson, but Dorothy saw no reason to copy it for her own
             records.</p>
                  
       <p>The Kenyon Transcript complicates the view that Dorothy&#8217;s text was never published except as part of William&#8217;s <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title>. 
             True, <title level="a">Excursion up Scawfell Pike</title> was never <hi rend="italic">printed</hi> as Dorothy&#8217;s during her lifetime, but it seems to have 
             enjoyed a lively public (or at least semipublic) existence in handwritten forms, moving among family, friends, and associates.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> 
             Considering <title level="a">Excursion Up Scafell Pike</title> as a manuscript publication naturally prompts us to ask if still more copies were made. This 
             question may be unanswerable. However, minor variants in De Sélincourt&#8217;s edition (<title level="m">DWJ</title>) that reflect neither DCMS 51 nor the Kenyon 
             Transcript suggest that an additional copy, now lost, might have been available to him. Owen and Smyser speculate on this point 
             (<title level="m">Prose</title> 2:367). Unfortunately, De Sélincourt says nothing about his manuscript sources.</note> Dorothy did write for an audience. 
             By revealing some of her circuits of communication, the Kenyon Transcript helps us guess at the significance of <title level="a">Excursion</title> for both its 
             writer and her friends and admirers. For more on the Kenyon Transcript, please see the appendix to our

       <p><anchor xml:id="In-addition"/>In addition to the missing Johnson letter, the lost letters Dorothy and Mary Barker wrote to Sara Hutchinson from Scafell Pike would surely round out our understanding
             of 7 October 1818. Did these summit posts recall another famous &#8220;Scawfell letter,&#8221; written to the same Sara by Samuel Taylor Coleridge 16 years before on 
             the neighboring peak?<note place="foot" resp="editors">STC&#8217;s exuberant journal-letter to SH has become a classic of mountain literature. He is often said to have been
             the first nonlocal to climb Scafell and also, accidentally, England&#8217;s first rock climber, as he got himself in a tight pinch while descending. From 5 August 1802,
             we have this self-dramatizing passage: &#8220;On a nice Stone Table am I now at this moment writing to you&#8212;between 2 and 3 o&#8217;clock as I guess, surely the first
             Letter ever written from the Top of Sca&#8217; Fell!&#8221; He adds, &#8220;You shall call this Letter when it passes before you the Sca&#8217;Fell Letter.&#8221; See Griggs, 
             <title level="m">Collected Letters</title>, 2:834&#8211;51. As Bainbridge notes, STC&#8217;s letter would be for the Wordsworth circle the &#8220;best-known of all 
             descriptions of mountain peril&#8221; (235).</note> We can only speculate, but it is not hard to imagine Dorothy recalling Coleridge&#8217;s exploit. Her &#8220;gift
             for drawing into the present all the wealth of past memories&#8221; surely applies to this text as it does to others.<note place="foot" resp="editors">This description

            <p>Our <ref target="/editions.2022.DW.SP-reading">annotated and illustrated reading text</ref> is based primarily on DCMS 51, with minor emendations indicated in notes
             and the shift to the Kenyon Transcript (where DCMS 51 is torn) clearly indicated. Our emendations reflect the fact that certain conventions that today&#8217;s readers
             take for granted were not fully standardized in the early nineteenth century. Like other editors of Romantic-era writing, we have tried to balance reading convenience
             with preserving our text&#8217;s historical character.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Our approach largely corresponds with that of William Knight, who wrote in his preface
             to <title level="m">Letters of the Wordsworth Family</title> (1907), &#8220;I have not retained the punctuation adopted by Wordsworth&#8212;sometimes there was
             none&#8212;nor the capital letters, which were both numerous, and very arbitrary. . . .It might have been interesting, from a linguistic point of view, to preserve
             all the archaisms of spelling and punctuation (even when the dashes took the place alike of semicolons, colons, and periods); but the Wordsworth family were so 
             arbitrary and casual in their letter-writing&#8212;and even careless at times&#8212;that it would have been unjust to them, as well as disturbing to their readers,
             to have done so&#8221; (1:xi).</note> Insofar as possible, we preserve Dorothy&#8217;s paragraphing, though her indentations vary and her intentions can be hard to discern.
             Dorothy&#8217;s underlined words are set in italics. Her ampersands are converted to <hi rend="italic">and</hi>, and her occasional abbreviations are expanded&#8212;for 
             example, &#8220;Sir G. and &amp; Lady B.&#8221; to &#8220;Sir George and Lady Beaumont.&#8221; Capitalization is largely standardized, though we retain some instances
             in which Dorothy seems to capitalize common nouns for emphasis. We also retain Dorothy&#8217;s spelling.</p>
                
       <p>Admittedly, any regularization may obscure important ambiguities or idiosyncrasies in the text. Some readers may wish to consult the original manuscripts to study
             Dorothy&#8217;s frequent and varied uses of dashes, as such marks either disappear in our reading text or appear uniformly as em dashes. Others may simply crave more 
             antiquarian flavor. Fortunately, our digital edition includes page images of the two manuscript sources [links] <!--where do I find these links?-->

                </head>
                
      <p>Though based on DCMS 51, the version of <title level="a">Excursion</title> that appears in William&#8217;s 1822 <title level="m">Guide</title> simplifies Dorothy&#8217;s
            textual chronology and removes all dates, as if aiming to make the account timeless. It introduces various minor revisions.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
            The <title level="m">Guide</title> version changes &#8220;Scaw Fell&#8221; to &#8220;Scawfell Head,&#8221; presumably to better distinguish that eminence 
            from Scafell Pike; adds a passage (relocated from a different section of the <title level="m">Guide</title>) about &#8220;celestial&#8221; drinking water 
            on neighboring Great Gavel; inserts a comparison between the colors of Scafell Pike&#8217;s lichen-painted stones and &#8220;brilliant feathers&#8221;; and so 
            forth. However, these are minor features; the principal transformation comes from removing contextual framing and the participants&#8217; names.</note> However, 
            the most obvious difference between Dorothy&#8217;s manuscript and the adaptation is the latter&#8217;s reduced length. William&#8217;s version includes approximately 1,205 words,
            whereas Dorothy&#8217;s original runs over 2,500. Unsurprisingly, Dorothy&#8217;s text is richer. The <title level="m">Guide</title>&#8217;s main editorial tendency is to make 
            Dorothy&#8217;s narrative less personal. In the manuscript, Dorothy begins by recording the visits of the Beaumonts and Wilberforces and by introducing Mary 
            Barker&#8212;that is, by assembling her cast of characters. All of this social context disappears in the <title level="m">Guide</title>. Thus, when the 
            <title level="m">Guide</title> reports, &#8220;Having left Rossthwaite [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] in Borrowdale . . . we ascended,&#8221; readers have 
            little sense of who &#8220;we&#8221; might be. In Dorothy&#8217;s manuscript, readers find friendship, personality, wonder, and humor, all shaping an expedition 
            organized by two intrepid women. In William&#8217;s abridgment, readers mainly encounter landscape visions that might be comparable with those afforded by the 
            Alps.<note place="foot" resp="editors">WW&#8217;s 1822 title page promises &#8220;illustrative remarks upon the Scenery of the Alps,&#8221; and his attempt to 
            &#8220;reconcile a Briton to the scenery of his own country&#8221; (120) has included an argument that, although the Lakeland fells cannot compare with 
            the Alps in absolute height and grandeur, they compare favorably in their proportions and combinations. Accordingly, WW introduces DW&#8217;s account in this 
            way: &#8220;The Reader may not however be displeased with the following extract from a letter to a Friend, giving an account of a visit to a summit of one 
            of the highest of these mountains; of which I am reminded by the observations of Mr. West, and by reviewing what has been said of this district in comparison
            with the Alps&#8221; (129&#8211;30). He has already quoted West saying that Britons who intend to tour the Continent should begin in the Lake District 
            &#8220;as it will give, in miniature, an idea of what they are to meet with there&#8221; (128). He and DW had recently undertaken this sort of comparison,
            exploring the Alps during their 1820 Continental tour.</note> After reading William&#8217;s version, one knows nothing of the occasion that prompted the mountain
            walk and finds no sign that any women were involved.</p>
                
     <p>What might Dorothy&#8217;s feelings have been about supplying this text for William&#8217;s <title level="m">Guide</title>? We have a few key facts to consider. First, 
            Dorothy was part of the project from the start. Back at the time of <title level="m">Select Views</title> (1810), the first version of what became the 
            <title level="m">Guide</title>, William asked Dorothy to finish some of the writing when the work became &#8220;irksome&#8221; to him.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
            Letter to Catherine Clarkson, 12 November 1810 (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:449).</note> Meanwhile, Dorothy opined that William might repurpose 
            <title level="m">Select Views</title>, create his own guide to the Lake District, and find the product more lucrative than his &#8220;higher [poetic] 
            labours.&#8221;<note place="foot" resp="editors">Letter to Catherine Clarkson, 18 November 1809 (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:372).</note> William 
            eventually took her advice by including <title level="m">Select Views</title> material in his 1820 <title level="m">River Duddon</title> volume. This experiment
            resulted in encouraging sales and reviews, so issuing a stand-alone guidebook seemed like a logical next step. However, for this purpose, William likely sensed 
            that his text needed some padding out.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In <title level="m">The River Duddon</title>, the <title level="a">Topographical Description
            of the Country of the Lakes in the North of England</title> ran to approximately 108 pages (213&#8211;321), or about a third of the total volume and some 40 
            percent of the total word count. The 1822 <title level="m">Guide</title> added ten thousand words and came to 156 pages.</note> Happily, he had promising material
            on hand in the form of Dorothy&#8217;s notebook and its copy of the Scafell Pike letter. Dorothy was fond of this autobiographical piece, which she had bound with other 
            specimens of her best work (DCMS 51). She was probably willing&#8212;perhaps even pleased&#8212;to see it in print, even if it would appear in truncated form. Perhaps
            William transformed it for his own ends, but we should keep in mind the likelihood that Dorothy wanted him to use it and even preferred that he remove personal 
            details about her and her friends. Indeed, she may have assisted with the edits.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Compare revisions DW made to 
            <title level="m">Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland, A.D. 1803</title> described well in <title level="m">DWB</title>, 411&#8211;12) when preparing a copy
            for possible publication; also, consider her rationale for refusing to print her <title level="a"><ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.Greens-intro">Narrative <!--anchor in Greens intro!-->
            Concerning George and Sarah Green,</ref></title> discussed elsewhere in this edition. Tact and privacy were important to her.</note> The 
            <title level="m">Guide</title> was an important effort in favor of the family economy, and Dorothy supported this endeavor as she had so many others.</p>
                
     <p>Readers must decide for themselves about the ethics of William&#8217;s borrowing, an issue that has been addressed repeatedly in studies of the Wordsworths 
            but perhaps not sufficiently with respect to <title level="a">Excursion up Scawfell Pike.</title> This instance of appropriation seems unique in scale 
            and significance, as William tacitly takes credit not only for Dorothy&#8217;s writing but also for her physical accomplishment. Might it not have been a 
            simple matter for William to describe the account as &#8220;an extract from <hi rend="italic">my sister&#8217;s</hi> letter to a friend&#8221;? Nonetheless, 
            we have no evidence that Dorothy objected to his editorial sleight of hand. Lucy Newlyn&#8217;s observation, offered in a different context, may apply in this 
            situation: &#8220;Dorothy&#8217;s preference was always for an anonymous role in their collaboration, but this need not be read as a sign that she believed 
            herself inferior. . . . Her labour was not alienated, and she knew her gifts to be greatly valued.&#8221;<note place="foot" resp="editors">Newlyn, 238.</note></p>
                
     <p>In any case, the <title level="m">Guide</title>&#8217;s incorporation of Dorothy&#8217;s Scafell Pike ascent must have been thought a success by all concerned. 
           The 1822 <title level="m">Guide</title> sold well, and then, in the 1823 edition, another gem from Dorothy&#8217;s notebook (DCMS 51) was added: her account 
           of an 1805 walking tour around <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.Ulls-intro">Ullswater</ref>. This meant <!--anchor to Ulls intro!-->
           that Dorothy&#8217;s presence in the <title level="m">Guide</title> grew as the project evolved. We do not know precisely how many words she contributed 
           in 1810 or 1820,<note place="foot" resp="editors">For conjectures on this point, see <title level="m">Prose</title> 2:126, 143. One substantial 1810 
           passage Owen and Smyser conclude to be DW&#8217;s, written in her hand, comes to 452 words. Unfortunately, handwriting in the 
           surviving <title level="m">Guide</title> manuscripts is no sure evidence of authorship, since DW, WW, MW, and SH all took turns 
           writing.</note> but in 1822, she generated at least 1,200 words out of the total 29,800 (about 4 percent), and in 1823, at least 4,446 words 
           of 35,300 (13 percent). The placement of her offerings was also important, since her two &#8220;excursions&#8221; became the final, climactic section 
           of the book.<note place="foot" resp="editors">As Mary Ellen Bellanca argues, DW&#8217;s writing reached readers mostly &#8220;by means of William&#8217;s poetic 
           reputation and in context ancillary to it,&#8221; but it <hi rend="italic">did</hi> find readers, and indeed it &#8220;helped to <hi rend="italic">make</hi> 
           [WW&#8217;s] reputation&#8221;; therefore, &#8220;it is well past time to discard the notion of Dorothy Wordsworth as an 
           unpublished, or only posthumously published, writer&#8221; (<title level="m">Daybooks</title>, 138). Along this line, it is noteworthy that 
           enthusiastic readers of the <title level="m">Guide</title> often singled out DW&#8217;s contributions. See, or instance, one of the earliest reviews, 
           which quoted the Scafell Pike narrative at length (<title level="a">Wordsworth&#8217;s Scenery of the Lakes,</title> 494&#8211;95).</note></p>

     <p>For over a century, the survival of Dorothy&#8217;s <title level="a">Excursion</title> in print depended on the popularity of 
            William&#8217;s <title level="m">Guide</title>. William Angus Knight did not include it in his 1897 edition of Dorothy&#8217;s journals or his 
            1907 <title level="m">Letters of the Wordsworth Family</title>. Consequently, as noted previously, its full public introduction had to 
            wait for the appearance of De Sélincourt&#8217;s 1941 <title level="m">Journals</title> (vol. 1).<note place="foot" resp="editors">De Sélincourt 
            had not included the text in his (first) edition of WW and DW&#8217;s correspondence, published 1935&#8211;39, possibly because the original 
            letter was missing. However, he did include the related letter to Jane Marshall and mention in a footnote that DW&#8217;s account of climbing 
            Scafell Pike could be found (revised) in WW&#8217;s <title level="m">Guide</title>.</note> De Sélincourt&#8217;s edition, with its brief but 
            valuable introduction, remained the standard for years.</p>
                
     <p>In 1970, the text appeared in the revised Oxford <title level="m">Letters of William and Dorothy Wordsworth</title> (vol. 3, 
            <title level="m">Middle Years II</title>, 1812&#8211;1820). This resource correctly reframed the text as a letter 
            (<title level="a">D. W. to William Johnson</title>); however, some information it provided was misleading. The editors of that volume, 
            Mary Moorman and Alan G. Hill, cited as their manuscript authority &#8220;<hi rend="italic">WL transcript [possibly in John Carter&#8217;s hand]</hi>.&#8221;<note 
            place="foot" resp="editors"><title level="m">Letters</title>, 3:499.</note> Either that 
            document has been lost or, more likely, the editors meant to describe what our edition calls the Kenyon Transcript, which is definitely 
            not in John Carter&#8217;s hand. Moreover, the editors did not faithfully follow that source. Instead, they largely adopted De Sélincourt&#8217;s text 
            from <title level="m">Journals</title>, though they did add one sentence, Dorothy&#8217;s final invitation to come explore the mountains.</p>
            
     <p>A few years later, W. J. B. Owen and Jane Worthington Smyser provided a more reliable and thoroughly annotated version of the Scafell Pike 
            <title level="a">Excursion</title> as an appendix to <title level="m">The Prose Works of William Wordsworth</title>, vol. 2 (1974), aiming to
            illuminate the origins of the <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title>. Unfortunately, <title level="m">Prose Works</title> is out of print,
            expensive to purchase on the used market, and available mainly in research libraries. It remains an essential source for scholars aiming to 
            trace textual variants; however, it is neither easily obtained nor especially friendly for the general reader, and it places Dorothy Wordsworth
            in a secondary role.</p>               
            
     <p><title level="a">Excursion up Scawfell Pike</title> was occasionally mentioned in scholarship of the 1980s and 90s; for instance, Susan M. Levin
           discussed it in her <title level="m">Dorothy Wordsworth and Romanticism</title> (1987). Surprisingly, however, Levin chose to omit it from her 
           own anthology, <title level="m">Dorothy Wordsworth, A Longman Cultural Edition</title> (2009). Susan Wolfson chose in 1999 to include most of 
           Dorothy&#8217;s <title level="a">Excursion</title> in <title level="m">The Longman Anthology of British Literature</title>, making the text available

           Anthology of British Literature</title> (1999 forward), specifically in <title level="m">Volume 2A, The Romantics and Their Contemporaries</title>,
           coedited by Susan Wolfson and Peter Manning. Wolfson has been one of the text&#8217;s most prominent recent champions. See also her 
           <title level="a">Two Wordsworths,</title> 61&#8211;82.</note> A few respected critics have discussed the text more recently. Still, it seems safe 
           to say that the text remains an underappreciated part of Dorothy&#8217;s oeuvre. We trust that this digital edition makes <title level="a">Excursion up 
           Scawfell Pike</title> available to a broader audience while also providing a vital and up-to-date resource to scholars.</p>
