                           house, commanding a fine view over the river, and of the rocky elevations, called
                           Hay Stacks. There is scarcely amongst these northern vallies, a place, in which an

                           In DCMS 51, DW first writes “Miss Barker proposed to me,” then crosses out “to me,”
                           opting for a more economical expression. The Kenyon Transcript retains “to me” and
                           other words crossed out in DCMS 51, suggesting that it was copied directly from the
                           original letter to Johnson or else from an early copy that has not survived.</span></div>

                           had been open since the sixteenth century, and they featured in contemporary maps

                  pass between Eskdale and Borrowdale; and such settlings are generally called by the
                  name of “the Hawes”—as Grisedale Hawes, Buttermere Hawes—from the German word Hals

                           local pronunciation has drifted somewhat. The usual spelling of “Ash Course” today
                           is “Esk Hause.” At this high pass, 2,470 feet above sea level, several footpaths intersect—

                  the Langdale Pikes—their own Vale below <span style="font-style:italic">them</span>, Windermere—and, far beyond, after a long long distance, Ingleborough in Yorkshire.
                  But how shall I speak of the peculiar deliciousness of the third prospect! At this

                  our dinner in summer warmth; and the stillness seemed to be not of this world. — We
                  paused, and kept silence to listen, and not a sound of any kind was to be heard. —
                  We were far above the reach of the cataracts of Scaw Fell; and not an insect was there
                  to hum the air. The vales before described lay in view; and, side by side with Eskdale,
                  we now saw the sister Vale of Donnerdale terminated by the Duddon Sands. But the majesty
                  of the mountains below and close to us, is not to be conceived. We now beheld the
                  whole mass of Great Gavel from its base—the Den of Wasdale at our feet, the gulph
                  immeasurable—Grassmire

               <p>While we were looking round after dinner our guide said to us that we must not linger
                  long, for we should have a storm. We looked in vain to espy the traces of it; for
                  mountains, vales, and sea were all touched with the clear light of the sun. “It is
                  there,” he said, pointing to the sea beyond Whitehaven; and, sure enough, we there
                  perceived a light cloud, or mist, unnoticeable but by a shepherd, accustomed to watch
                  all mountain bodings.

                           the meaning of all winds, / Of blasts of every tone” (lines 46–49). She may also echo
                           STC’s The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere: “I saw something in the Sky / No bigger than
                           my fist; / At first it seem’d a little speck / And then it seem’d a mist: / It mov’d

                           text). This same passage from Rime may influence DW’s description of cloud shapes

                  to cold, and we saw the tiny vapour swelled into mighty masses of cloud which came
                  boiling over the mountains. Great Gavel, Helvellyn, and Skiddaw were wrapped in storm;
                  yet Langdale, and the mountains in that quarter were all bright with sunshine. Soon
                  the storm reached us; we sheltered under a crag;

               of the altitude. People long considered Scafell (3,163 ft.) the highest peak on the
               massif, but “the measurers of mountains” (beginning with Joseph Banks’s Trigonometrical
               Survey team in 1790) concluded that Scafell Pike (3,209 ft.) was in fact higher. Early
               nineteenth-century maps depict this little-explored neighborhood without much detail;
               indeed, some show no mountains at all. However, both Jonathan Otley’s map of 1818
               and Sidney Hall’s map for WW’s 1822 <em>Guide</em> make the distinction between Scawfell and the Scawfell Pike or Pikes. Today, Scafell
               Pike, Ill Crag, and Broad Crag are often designated collectively as the “Pikes of

               it. Nonetheless, as in the earlier instance (see n6), “Stonethwaite” is certainly
               a mistake. The walkers would end their descent from Sty Head at Seathwaite, where
               they would retrieve their cart. From that place, they would take the 2.5-mile road
               back to Mary Barker’s home in Rosthwaite, passing the turn to nearby Stonethwaite
               but not taking it. It is true that Rosthwaite is situated on the Stonethwaite arm
               of the River Derwent and that the toponyms resemble each other, so some confusion
               was understandable. WW, in the <em>Guide</em>, correctly has “Seathwaite” in this position.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note19_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
