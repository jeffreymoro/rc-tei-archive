               <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Editor’s note:</span> Given the enduring norm in editions such as this of presenting a writer’s works chronologically,
                  Dorothy Wordsworth’s commonplace book poems pose a challenge. Not only is it impossible
                  to know whether the order in which the poems appear in DCMS 120 corresponds with their
                  order of composition, but we also have no means to ascertain the precise temporal
                  relationship between material copied into the opposite ends of the notebook. Therefore,
                  rather than attempt to order the poems by date or impose any single organizational
                  scheme upon a notebook that was never intended to reach the public, we present here
                  two models for working through the poems:</p>
               <dl>
                  <dt></dt>
                  <dd><span style="font-weight:bold">Table of contents 1</span> shows how, like the typical commonplace book, DCMS 120 intermingles the author’s
                     own creative work or personal reflections with miscellaneous quotations, recipes,
                     and extracts. This table therefore captures a core feature of this notebook that gets
                     obscured in our <a class="link_ref" href="editions.2022.DW.Poems.xml">reading text</a>, which transcribes only Dorothy’s original poems. It also highlights the fact that
                     this notebook is an ambigraph—or a book that begins on either end (see <a class="link_ref" href="editions.2020.DW.Poems-intro.xml">this section’s introduction</a>)—by dividing its contents into two parts. <span style="font-weight:bold">Table 1A</span> lists texts that appear right-side up when one reads from the front cover. Conversely,
                     <span style="font-weight:bold">Table 1B</span> lists those written in the other direction, and hence read by flipping the book over
                     and beginning from the back cover.</dd>
                  <dt></dt>
                  <dd><span style="font-weight:bold">Table of contents 2</span> instead lists just the poems, clustering together different versions of the same
                     text but otherwise presenting them in their order of appearance in DCMS 120. Studying
                     alternate versions of her poems offers a clearer understanding of both the nature
                     of Dorothy’s revisions and the types of poems she repeatedly reworked. While, for
                     ease in referencing, we have labeled variant texts according to their sequence in
                     DCMS 120 (e.g., Version A, Version B, etc.), we caution against assuming earlier versions
                     of poems appear earlier in the notebook. Readers should also be aware that a degree
                     of editorial judgment has gone into grouping together texts, as some poems appearing
                     under a single title contain major variants. For example, 
                     “Lines intended for my Niece’s Album”
                     (12, 13)—a poem Dorothy wrote for her namesake, Dora—was drafted or copied first into
                     DCMS 120. It appears in both a 5-stanza and a 12-stanza version (with considerable
                     differences between the shared stanzas). These two versions exist because Dorothy
                     marks the first seven stanzas in the 12-stanza version (see fig. 6B.1) as “Not to
                     be put in this album,” a puzzling note in a poem that has been written explicitly
                     for that purpose, especially since the rejected stanzas contain no obviously unacceptable
                     material. A similar gesture is found in 
                     “Lines intended for Edith Southey’s album,”
                     in which “Not intended for the Album” is penciled at the top of the second page of
                     the poem. What these notes about excisions suggest is that Dorothy was highly cognizant
                     of the need to modify her poems for different audiences, as her concern may have been
                     that the poems would have a wider circulation when copied in her niece’s and Edith’s
                     albums. It also suggests that she exercised control over who saw this manuscript notebook.
                     We also find Dorothy returning to some poems, especially 
                     “Grasmere—A Fragment”
                     (four versions), 
                     “Lines written (rather say begun)”
                     (seven versions), and 
                     “Loving &amp; Liking”
                     (three versions), repeatedly, revising various sections, sometimes only individual
                     stanzas or lines. To say therefore that they are “versions” of the same poem may,
                     in some cases, be overstating the case.</dd>

                  denoted by insert numbers, and sometimes are described only as inserts/patches with
                  the relevant folio given to describe where they are added and, usually, how they are
                  attached. In the transcription document, all patches have been separately transcribed,
