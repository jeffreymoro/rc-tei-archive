            Dorothy Wordsworth at the request of her Brother,<lb/>

                which was to see her Daughter who was in service there, and to settle with her
                Mistress about her continuing in her place. Accordingly, after having spent a few

               daylight was entirely gone. They had left a Daughter at home, eleven years of age, with the
                care of five other Children younger than herself, the youngest an Infant at the
                breast; and they, poor Things! sate up till eleven o&#8217;clock expecting their Parents:

                they stayed all night in Langdale because of the weather. All next day they
                continued to expect them, and again went to bed as before; and at noon on Monday,
                one of the Boys went to the nearest house to borrow a Cloak, and, on being asked for
                what purpose, he replied that his Sister was going to Langdale, as he expressed it,

                be found; nor any tidings heard, except what I have mentioned, and that a Shepherd
                who had been upon the Mountains on Sunday morning had observed indistinct foot-marks
                of two Persons who had walked close together. Those foot-marks were now covered with
                fresh snow: the spot where they had been seen was at the top of Blea Crag above
                Easedale Tarn, that very spot where I myself had sate down <hi rend="sup">&lt;three&gt;</hi>

                not knowing whither. When, at last, the mist cleared away I found myself at the edge
                of the Precipice, and trembled at the Gulph below, which appeared immeasurable.
                Happily I had some hours of daylight before me, and after a laborious walk, <del

                as long as daylight lasted the search was continued. It was like a sabbath in the
                Vale: for all the Men who were able to climb the heights had left their usual work,
                nor returned to it till the Bodies of the unfortunate Pair were found, which was on
                Wednesday afternoon. The Woman was first discovered upon some rough ground just
                above the mountain enclosures beside Mill Beck, in Langdale, which is the next
                stream or torrent to that which forms Dungeon Gill Waterfall. Several Persons, the
                day before had been within a few yards of the spot where she lay; but her body had
                then been covered with snow, which was now melted. Her Husband was found at no great
                distance: he had fallen down a Precipice; and must have perished instantly, for his
                Skull was much fractured. It is supposed that his Wife had been by his side when he
                fell, as one of her shoes was left midway on the Bank above the precipice;
                afterwards (probably having stumbled over a crag) she had rolled many yards down the
                breast of the hill. Her body was terribly bruised. It is believed that they <del

                was well known that if the Mother had been <hi rend="underline">alive</hi> she would have
                returned to her sucking Babe) two or three ^<hi rend="sup">Women,</hi> Friends of the

                found them in a wretched state &#8220;all crying together.&#8221; They had passed two whole days
                (from Saturday noon till Monday noon) without seeing any body, waiting patiently and
                without fear; and when the word came that their Father and Mother must have died

            In a little time, however, they were somewhat pacified; and food was brought into the
                house; for their stock was almost exhausted, their Parents being the poorest People
                in the Vale, though they had a small estate of their own, and a Cow. This morsel of
                Land, now deeply mortgaged, had been in the

                possession of the Family for many generations, and they were loth to part with it:
                consequently they had never had any assistance from the Parish. George Green had been
                twice married. By his former Wife he has left one Son and three Daughters; 
                and by her who died with him four Sons and four Daughters, all
                under sixteen years of age. They must very soon have parted with their Land if they
                had lived: for their means were reduced by little and little till scarcely anything
                <hi rend="underline">but</hi> the <hi rend="underline">Land</hi> was left. The
                Cow was grown old; and they had not money to buy another; they had sold their horse;
                and were in the habit of carrying any trifles <del rend="strike">that</del>
                they could spare out of house or stable to barter for potatoes or meal
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors">[BL meal = oat-meal]</note>.
                Luxuries they had none they never made tea, and when the Neighbours went to look
                after the Children they found nothing in the house but two boilings of potatoes, a
                very little meal, little bread, and three or four legs of lean dried mutton.

                <p>The Cow, at that time, did not give a quart of milk in the day. You will wonder how
                they lived at all; and indeed I can scarcely tell you. They used to sell a few peats
                in the summer, which they dug out of their own hearts&#8217; heart, their Land; and the
                old Man (he was sixty five years of age) might earn a little <hi rend="sup">^ money</hi>
                by doing <del rend="strike">odd</del> jobs for his neighbours; but it was not known till
                now (at least by <hi rend="underline">us</hi>) how much distressed they must have been:
                for they were never heard to murmur or complain. See them when you would, both were
                chearful; and when they went to visit a Friend, or to a Sale they were decently
                dressed. Alas! a love of Sales had always been their failing, being perhaps the only 
                publick meetings in this neighbourhood where social pleasure is to be had without the necessity
                of expending money, except, indeed, our annual Fair, and on that day I can recollect having more
                than once seen Sarah Green among the rest with her chearful countenance_ two or
                three little-ones about her; and their youngest Brother or Sister, an Infant, in her
                arms. These things are now remembered; and the awful event checks all disposition to
                harsh comments; perhaps formerly it might be said,

                and with truth, the Woman had better been at home: but who shall assert that this
                same spirit which led her to come at times among her Neighbours as an equal, like
                them seeking society and pleasure, that this spirit did not assist greatly in
                preserving her <hi rend="sup">^ in</hi> chearful independence of mind through the
                many hardships and privations of extreme poverty? &#8212; Her Children, though very
                ragged, were always cleanly, and are as pure and innocent, and in every respect as
                promising Children as any I ever saw. The three or four latest born, it is true,
                look as if they had been checked in their grown for want of full nourishment; but none 
                appear unhealthy except the youngest, a fair and beautiful Infant. It looks sickly, but
                not suffering: there is a heavenly patience in its countenance; and, while it lay asleep
                in its cradle three days after its Mother&#8217;s death, one could not look upon it

                replied, and I believe that, though he left a profitable employment (he is by trade

                House! and indeed in like manner have I since frequently heard it spoken of by
                Persons less nearly concerned; but who still retain a vivid remembrance of the
                former affliction. It is, when any unusual event happens, affecting to listen to the
                fireside talk in our Cottages; you then find how faithfully the inner histories of      
                Families, their lesser and greater cares, their peculiar habits, and ways of life
                are recorded in the breasts of their Fellow-inhabitants of the Vale; much more
                faithfully than it is possible that the lives of those who have moved in higher
                stations, and had numerous Friends in the busy world can be preserved in
                remembrance, even when their doings and sufferings have been watched for the express
                purpose of recording them in written narratives. I heard a Woman, a week ago,
                describe in as lively a manner the sufferings of George Green&#8217;s Family, when the
                former two Funerals went out of the house as if <hi rend="underline">that</hi> trouble had been the
                <hi rend="underline">present</hi> trouble. Among other things she related how
                Friends and Acquaintances, as is the custom here, when any one is sick, used to
                carry presents; but, instead of going to comfort the Family with their company and
                conversation, laid their gifts upon a Wall near the house, and watched till they
                were taken away.

               <p>It was, as I have said, on the Wednesday that we went to visit the Orphans. A few

                away any thing; she immediately, however, perceived that she ought to accept of it,
                and a Woman, who was near us, observed that it was an ancient custom now much disused;

                on each side of the Father&#8217;s Coffin, leaning over it. The eldest Daughter had been
                unable to follow with the rest of the Mourners, and we had led her back to the house
                before she got through the first field; the second fainted by the Grave side; and
                their Brother stood like a Statue of Despair, silent and motionless; the younger
                Girls sobbed aloud. Many tears were shed by persons who had known little of the
                Deceased; and all the people who were gathered together appeared to be united in one
                general feeling of sympathy for the helpless condition of the Orphans. After the
                Funeral the Family returned to their melancholy home. There was a Sale of the
                furniture on the Thursday following; and the next day the house was left empty and silent.
                A Lady from Ambleside had fetched the four little Boys on the day of the Funeral, to keep

                our door; they walked up the hill beside the Car in which they had been riding, and
                were chattering to their new Friend, no doubt well pleased with the fine

                entirely herself; and my Sister came down stairs with tears of joy in her eyes.
                &#8220;Aye,&#8221; said our Neighbour, Peggy Ashburner &#8220;that Woman 
                <hi rend="underline">will</hi> win Heaven for protecting the Fatherless and

                and were afraid that the Lady&#8217;s kindness was ill-judged, that it might
                unsettle them when they should be taken away from the grand house to a more humble
                dwelling. There are eight Children left under sixteen years of age. The eldest,
                a Girl, is in service, the second has lived with us more than half a year, and we

                we heard of the loss of her Parents, we determined to keep her till she also is fit
                for service. The eldest, and only remaining Son of George Green by his first Wife
                will maintain one of the Boys and bring him up to his own trade; so that there

                little or nothing will remain for his Family. It is the custom at Grasmere, and I
                believe in many other places, to <hi rend="underline">let</hi>, as they call it,
                those Children who depend wholly upon the Parish, to the lowest Bidder, that is, to

                take them at the cheapest rate; and such as are the least able to provide for them
                properly are often the readiest Bidders, for the sake of having a little money coming in,
                though, in fact, the profit can be but very small: but they feel that they get something
                when the money comes, and do not feel exactly what they expend for the Children because 
                they are fed out of the common stock. At ten years of age they are removed from their
                boarding-houses, and generally put out as Parish Apprentices, at best a slavish
                condition; but sometimes they are hardly used, and sometimes

                numerous Children, and following them up and down the lanes. Sunday was no holiday

                on that day; and he never went to Church. I recollect, when I first came to live in
                this Country, a little more than eight years ago, observing his vacant way of
                roaming about. I remarked that there was an appearance of natural quickness with
                much good temper
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors">[BL temper = nature]</note>
                in his countenance; but he looked wild and untutored: it was the face of a Child who
                had none to love him, and knew not in his heart what love was. He is now sixteen
                years old, and a strong, handsome-featured Boy; but though still the same traces of
                natural sense and good-temper appear, his countenance expresses almost savage
                ignorance, with bold vice. To this day he does not know a letter in a book; nor can
                ^<hi rend="sup">he</hi> say his prayers, (as Peggy Ashburner expressed it strongly
                in speaking of him to Sara) &#8220;That poor Lad, if aught were to happen to him cannot

                him in <hi rend="sup">driving</hi> carrying slates to the next market_town, and, young 
                as he is, he has often come home intoxicated. Sometimes, no doubt, the liquor is given
                to him; but he has more than once been detected in dishonest practices, probably

                desire of obtaining liquor. I hope and believe that it does not often happen in this
                neighbourhood that Parish Apprentices are so grossly neglected as this Boy has been;
                and I need not give you my reasons for thinking that there is not another Family in
                Grasmere who would have done the like: nor <del rend="strike">even</del> could
                it have been so bad even in this instance if the Boy had not come from a distant
                place, and consequently the Parish Officers are not in the way of seeing how he goes
                on; and I am afraid that, in such cases, they seldom take the trouble of making
                inquiries. You will not wonder, after what I have said, that we have been anxious to
                preserve these Orphans whom we saw so uncorrupted from the possibility of being
                brought up in such a manner, especially as there is

               were employing their thoughts in like manner; and our united efforts have been even
                more successful than we had dared to hope. It was a month yesterday since the sad 
                event happened, and the Children are all settled in their several homes,
                ^<del rend="strike"> in</del> <hi rend="sup">and all are in</hi> the Vale of Grasmere,
                except the eldest Boy, George, who is with his Brother at Ambleside. A Subscription has
                been made for the purpose of adding a little to the weekly allowance of the Parish, and
                to send them to School to apprentice the Boys, and to fit the Girls out for service; and,
                if there be any overplus, it is to be dealt out among them as they shall prove deserving,

                appeared to be interested for the Orphans; and the Subscription_book, which we have
                seen this evening, is equally creditable to all ranks. With five guineas, ten
                guineas, three guineas, is intermingled a long list of shillings and sixpences, and

                welcomed. It had been declared with one voice by the people of the Parish, men and
                women, that the Infant and her Sister Jane should not be parted. The Woman, who was
                to have the care of these two, was from home, and had requested a Neighbour to be in

                some months ago, when they chanced to meet her in Easedale; at first not knowing who
                she was. They were struck, at a distance, with her beautiful figure and her dress,
                as she was tripping over the wooden bridge at the entrance of the Valley; and, when
                she drew nearer, the sweetness of her countenance, her blooming cheeks, her modest,
                wild and artless appearance quite enchanted them. <del rend="strike">William</del>

                which was on one side gracefully elbowed out, or distended as with a blast of wind

                and a pink bonnet tyed with a blue ribband, the lively colours harmonizing most
                happily with her blooming complexion. Part of this dress had probably been made up
                of her elder Sister&#8217;s cast-off cloaths: for they were accustomed to give to their
                Father&#8217;s Family whatever they could spare; often, I believe, more than they could
                well afford. Little did <del rend="strike">William</del> ^ <hi rend="sup">my Brother</hi>

                at that time think that she was so soon to be called to such important duties; and
                as little that such a creature was capable of so much: for this was the Child who
                was left by her Parents at the head of the helpless Family, and was as a Mother to
                her Brothers and Sister when they were fatherless and motherless, not knowing of
                their loss. Her conduct at that time has been

                the admiration of every body. She had nursed the Baby; and, without confusion or

                other matters with perfect regularity, had milked the Cow at night and morning,
                wound up the clock, and taken care that the fire should not go out, a <del

                of importance in that house so far from any other, a tinder-box being a convenience
                which they did not possess. This little Girl I saw, as I have told you, take her
                place in her new home with entire composure: I know not indeed how to find a word
                sufficiently strong to express what I mean: it was a calmness amounting to dignity,
                which gave to every motion a perfect grace. We next went with two Boys in petticoats
                to a neat Farm_house: the Man and his Wife came down the lane a hundred yards to
                meet us, and would have taken the Children by the hand with almost parental
                kindness; but they clung to Miss Knott, the Lady who had fetched them from their
                Father&#8217;s Cottage on the day of the Funeral, &amp; had treated them tenderly ever
                since. The younger sate

                upon her lap while we remained in the house, and his Brother leaned against me: they
                continued silent; but I felt, some minutes before our departure, by the workings of
                his breast, that the elder Boy was struggling with grief, at the thought of parting
                with his old Friend. I looked at him, and perceived that his eyes were full of

                tears: the younger Child, with less foresight, continued
                calm till the last moment, when both burst into an agony of grief. We have since
                heard that a slice of break and butter <del rend="strike">soon</del>

                in the kind Woman&#8217;s manners than she had observed in her for a long time. They, poor
                Things! are perfectly contented; one of them was overheard saying to the other,

                but we will never go away frae this House.&#8221; We next went with the last remaining one
                of our charge, a Boy seven years old: his sorrow gathered while we were in the
                Chaise at the apprehension of parting from his Friend: he repeated more than once,
                however, that he was glad to go ^ <hi rend="sup">to</hi> the house whither we were taking him; and Miss Knott,

                had been kind to his Father and Mother, and had given them two sheep last year. She
                also related what seemed to me a remarkable proof of the Child&#8217;s sensibility. There
                had been some intention of fixing them

                uneasy at the thought of going thither, because, as he said, the Master of the House
                had had a quarrel with his Father. It appears that George Green and John Fleming
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors">[BL John Fleming and George Green = George Green and John Fleming]</note>

                a particular regard for each other; he was the Godfather of his Friend&#8217;s Daughter
                Jane, to whom he says he will give a fleece of wool every year to spin for
                ^ <hi rend="sup">her own</hi> stockings, [illegible deleted word] and, from
                the day that the death of their Parents was known, he expressed a wish to have the
                care of little John. The manner in which he greeted the Boy, who could not utter a
                word for weeping, corresponded with this; he took hold of him, and patted his head
                as lovingly as if he had been his Grandfather, saying, &#8220;Never fear mun! thou shalt
                go upon the hills after the sheep; thou <hi rend="underline">kens my</hi> sheep!&#8221;
                then (addressing himself to us) he went on_

                <p>never had any disturbance among them.&#8221; Meanwhile poor John did not cease crying, and
                continued to weep as long as we remained in the house; but we have since seen him as
                happy and contented as plenty of food and kindness could make any Child. His Master
                is feeble and paralytic; but he spends most of his time out of doors, looking about
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors">[BL about = over]</note>
                his own fields, or following the sheep. In these walks he had formerly no Companion

                on their return homewards; little John was running here and there, as sportive as a
                mountain lamb; for the Child may wander at will after his own fancies, and yet be a
                faithful attendant upon his Master&#8217;s course; for <hi rend="underline">he</hi> creeps
                at a slow pace, with tottering steps. Much as the old Man delights in his new
                charge, his Housekeeper appears to have
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors">[BL have = take]</note>
                little less pleasure in him: I found her last night knitting stockings for him out

                that she had watched him feelingly; among the rest, that on Saturday, his weekly

                Gill, where they had some sheep; they passed by his Father&#8217;s door, and the Child
                said to her (looking about, I suppose, in one of the Fields which had belonged to
                his Parents) &#8220;My Mother&#8217;s Ewe has got a fine Lamb.&#8221; The Woman watched his

                they were playful but not quarrelsome; and, though with hundreds of objects around
                them that were perfectly new and strange, they never had done any mischief, hardly

                which they have taken to their new homes proves that no wayward desires had been
                raised in them by the luxuries among which they had lived for the last three weeks;
                and we have been truly happy to perceive that our fears that this might happen were

                said. You will conclude with me that if <del rend="strike">the conduct of</del>
                the Parents had not shewn an example of honesty, good-temper, and good manners these
                happy effects could not have followed: but I believe that the operation of their <del

            </p><pb/>
                
            <p rend="right">31</p>
                <p>aided by the peculiar situation of themselves and their Children. They lived in a
                lonely house where they seldom saw any body
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors">[BL any body = either strangers or neighbours]</note>.
                These Children had no Playfellows but their own Brothers and Sisters; and wayward
                inclinations or uneasy longings, where there was no choice of food or toys, no
                luxuries to contend for, could scarcely exist, they seeing nothing of such feelings
                in their Parents. There was no irregular variety in the earlier part of their
                infancy and childhood, and when they were old enough to be trusted from home they
                rarely went further than their own fields, except to go on errands; so that even
                then they would be governed by the sense of having a duty to perform. No doubt many
                Families are brought up in equal solitude and under the same privations; and we see
                no such consequences; and I am well aware that these causes have often a baneful
                effect if the Parents themselves be vicious; but such very poor People as in their
                situation most resemble these are generally in a state of dependence; and the chain
                which holds them back from dishonesty or any disgraceful conduct is by no means so
                strong. While George and Sarah Green held possession of the little estate inherited
                from their Forefathers they were in a superior station; and thus elevated in their
                own esteem

                temptation to unworthiness. The love of their few fields and their ancient home was
                a salutary passion, and, no doubt something of this must have spread <del

                        <note place="foot" resp="editors">[BL <del rend="strike">itself</del> = not canceled]</note>
                to the Children. The Parents&#8217; cares and their chief employments were centred there;
                and, as soon as the ^ <hi rend="sup">children</hi> could run about, even the youngest
                could take part in them while the elder would do this with a depth of interest which
                cannot be felt, even in rural life, where people are only transitory occupants of the soil on
                which they live. I need not remind you how much more such a situation as I have
                described as favourable to innocent and virtuous ^ <hi rend="sup">habits and</hi>

                feelings than that of those Cottagers who live in solitude and poverty without any
                out-of-doors employment. It is pleasant to me here to recollect how I have seen
                these very Children (with no Overlooker except when it was necessary for the elder
                to overlook the younger) busied in turning the peats which their Father had dug out
                of their

                and bearing away those which were dry (in burthens of three or four) upon their
                shoulders. In this way the Family were bound together by the same cares and
                exertions; and already one of them has proved that she maintained this spirit after
                she had quitted her Father&#8217;s Roof. The eldest, Mary, when only fourteen years of
                age, spared a portion of her year&#8217;s wages to assist them in paying for

            <p>her Grandfather. She is a Girl of strong sense, and there is a thoughtfulness and
                propriety in her manners which I have seldom seen in one so young; this with great
                appearance of sensibility which shewed itself at the time of her Parents&#8217; death, and
                since, in her [illegible deleted word]

                anxiety for her Brothers and Sisters. Much, indeed, as I have said of the moral
                causes tending to produce that submissive, gentle, affectionate, and I may add <hi
                rend="underline">useful</hi> character in these children, I have omitted to
                speak of the foundation of all, their own natural dispositions, or rather their
                constitutional temperament of mind and body. I am convinced from observation that
                there is in the whole Family a peculiar tenderness of Nature; perhaps inherited from
                their Father, whom I have several times heard speak of his own Family in a manner
                that shewed an uncommonly feeling heart; once especially: two or three years ago,
                when his Boy George had scalded himself and was lying dangerously ill, we met him in
                Easedale; and he detained us a full quarter of an hour while he talked of his

                Child’s sufferings and his surpassing patience. I well remember the poor Father&#8217;s
                words &#8220;He never utters a groan_ never so much as says Oh Dear! but when he sees us
                grieved for him encourages us and often says &#8220;Never fear, I warrant you I shall get
                better again.&#8221; These circumstances and many more which
            </p><pb/>

                I do not so distinctly recollect the old Man repeated with tears streaming down his
                cheeks; yet we often saw a smile of pride in his face while he spoke of the Boy&#8217;s
                fortitude and undaunted courage. I have said that George Green had been twice
                married, and that his Son and Daughters by the first Wife are in a respectable
                condition of life; but he had not only brought up thus far his own large Family; but
                also two Children, a Son and a Daughter, whom his Wife had borne before marriage. He
                received eighteen pence weekly towards the maintenance of each, and brought them up
                as his own Children. I do not know what Sarah Green&#8217;s general conduct before
                marriage may have been, further than that she was a <hi rend="underline">young</hi>

                Woman when these Children were born. She had been a Parish Apprentice and therefore,
                probably, a neglected Child, and, having had the merit of conquering her failings,
                she for that cause may perhaps be entitled to a higher praise than would have been
                her due if she had never fallen. Her conduct as a Wife and a Mother <del rend="strike">were</del>

                irreproachable. Though she could not read herself, she had taught all her Children,

                Since their Parents&#8217; death two of the Boys have gone regularly to school; and George,
                the eldest, takes particular delight his Book. The little Fellow used to lie down upon
                the carpet in Miss Knott&#8217;s parlour poring over the

                one fault; they were rather &#8220;too <hi rend="underline">Stiff</hi>,&#8221; unwilling to

                those who knew them best were willing to lend them a little money to help them out
                of a difficulty; yet very lately they had sent to the shop for a loaf of bread, and
                because the Child went without ready money the Shopkeeper refused to let them have
                the bread. We, in our connection with them have had one opportunity of remarking
                (alas! we gained our knowledge since their death) how chearfully they submitted

                necessity, and how faithful they were to their word. Our little Sally wanted two
                shifts: we sent to desire her Mother to procure them; the Father went the very next
                day to Ambleside to buy the cloth, and promised to pay for it in three weeks. The
                shifts were sent to Sally without a word of the difficulty of procuring them, or
                anything like a complaint. After her Parent&#8217;s death we were very sorry (knowing now
                so much of their extreme poverty) that we had required this of them, and on asking
                whether the cloth was paid for (intending <del rend="strike">ourselves</del>

                to discharge that debt) we were told by one of the Daughters that she had been to
                the Shop purposely to make the enquiry, and found that, two or three days before the
                time promised, her Father had himself gone to pay the money. Probably if they had
                lived a<del rend="strike">nother</del> week longer they must have carried some
                article of furniture out to barter for that week&#8217;s provisions. I have mentioned how
                very little food there was in the house at that time_ there was no money,_not even a
                single halfpenny!_ The pair had each threepence in their pockets when they were
                found upon the mountains.

                With her many cares and fears for her helpless Family she must, at that time, have
                mingled some bitter self-reproaches for her boldness in venturing over the
                Mountains: for they had asked two of the Inhabitants of the Vale to accompany them,
                who refused to go by that way on account of the bad weather, and she laughed at them
                for being cowardly. It is now said that her Husband was always fond of doing things
                that nobody else liked to venture upon, though

                was healthy and active, one of the freshest Women of her years that I ever noticed,

                Death. Her Husband&#8217;s Daughters speak of their Mother-in-law

                with great respect: she always, whenever they went to their Father&#8217;s house, strove
                to make it as comfortable to them as she could; and never suffered her own Children
                to treat them unbecomingly. One of the young Women, who has long been a Servant in
                respectable Families in the neighbourhood, told us with tears in her eyes, that once,
                not very long ago, she went to Blentern Gill, not intending to stay all night, and 
                when she took up her Cloak to go away her Mother said to her, &#8220;What you cannot stop

                the Mountains, though night was coming on. In her distraction she thought that <hi
