            <p>On 19 March 1808, a local married couple, George and Sarah Green, died attempting to
                cross Langdale Fell on their way home during a storm. They lived at the far end of
                Easedale, about two miles northwest of the Wordsworths, who were living in Dove
                Cottage, Town End, Grasmere, at the time and had employed one of the Greens&#8217;
                daughters, Sally, as a maid. The Greens&#8217; deaths orphaned eight children under 
                the age of 16 and six under age 11, as well as six grown children by previous
                marriages.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">The eight young children of George and Sarah Green were Mary (b. 1793, age 15); Sarah, called
                     Sally (b. 1795, age 12); Jane (b. 1796, age 11); George (b. 1798, age 10); John (b. 1800, age 7); William (b. 1804, age 4); 
                     Thomas (b. 1805, age 3); and an infant &#8220;at the breast,&#8221; Hannah (b. 1807, age 1). George Green had a son and three
                     daughters by a prior marriage: Margaret (b. 1766); Betty (b. 1771); Agnes, or Aggy) (b. 1775, d. 1842); and James (b. 1777, d.
                     1851). Sarah Green had had a son and a daughter before her marriage; both were in service in Langdale in 1808. Dates from

                George Green was 65, and Sarah, considerably younger at 43, had recently given birth
                to a baby girl.

                    which interestingly has George&#8217;s age at death as 66 rather than 65. [Illustration: the grave in St. Oswald&#8217;s churchyard, Grasmere.]</note>

                The loss of the parents threw &#8220;the whole vale,&#8221; in Dorothy 
                Wordsworth&#8217;s words, into &#8220;the greatest consternation.&#8221;

            </head>
               <p>Nine days after the tragedy, Dorothy reported to her friend Catherine Clarkson that
               the Wordsworths had immediately been &#8220;employed in laying schemes to prevent the
               children from falling into the hands of persons who may use them unkindly.&#8221;
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors"><title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:206, DW to Catherine Clarkson, 28 March 1808. DW also criticizes
                    the practice of orphans being boarded in the <title level="a">Narrative concerning George &amp; Sarah Green</title> (hereafter 
                    <title level="a">Narrative</title>) itself, describing how they were often given &#8220;to the lowest Bidder, that is, to board them 
                    out with Persons who will take them at the cheapest rate; and such as are the least able to provide for them properly are often the 
                    readiest Bidders, for the sake of having a little money coming in.&#8221; At 10 years of age, children were made parish apprentices,
                    &#8220;at best a slavish condition.&#8221; DW also explains how Sarah Green herself had &#8220;been a Parish Apprentice and therefore,
                    probably, a neglected Child.&#8221;</note>
                The specific fear was that the young Greens would suffer the usual fate of orphans, 
                being boarded out by the parish to foster families paid a mere two shillings per week
                per child. Accordingly, the Wordsworths began to solicit donations, and a brief 
                account of the events was written by William and circulated to those who might be 
                willing to contribute (see appendix A).
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">WW wrote letters asking for donations, enclosing the short description of the events, in extant 1808
                    letters to Richard Sharp (<title level="m">Letters</title> 2:210, 13 April) and Francis Wrangham (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:

                It seems that the Wordsworths were tireless in their efforts, as William, in a letter
                to Francis Wrangham dated 17 April 1808, apologizes for the &#8220;dim transcript made
                by a multiplying writer, we having had occasion to make so many copies.&#8221;

            <p>A letter from William to Coleridge written precisely one month after the tragedy, on
                19 April 1808, included a copy of a short poem he had written entitled 
                <title level="a">Elegiac Stanzas composed in the Churchyard of Grasmere, Westmorland,
                a few days after the Internment there of a Man and his Wife, Inhabitants of the Vale,
                who were lost upon the neighbouring Mountains, on the night of the nineteenth of March
                last</title> (see appendix B).

                William urged Coleridge, who was then in London delivering a series of lectures, to 
                &#8220;turn these verses to any profit for the poor Orphans in any way, either by 
                reciting, circulating in manuscript or publishing them.&#8221; William also explained,
                &#8220;As soon as she has leisure Dorothy means to draw up a minute detail of all that
                she knows concerning the lives and characters of the Husband and Wife, and everything
                relating to their melancholy end, and its effect upon the Inhabitants of this Vale; a
                story that will be rich both in pleasure and profit.&#8221; Dorothy, in fact, had begun
                drafting her own record at roughly this same time, as evidenced by her noting near the
                beginning of her account, &#8220;It was a month yesterday since the sad event happened.&#8221;
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">DCMS 64, 18. Unless otherwise noted, all quotations from the &#8220;Narrative&#8221; included in this 
                    introduction refer to DCMS 64.</note>
                The end of the <title level="a">Narrative</title> is signed and dated 4 May 1808, suggesting that
                Dorothy completed it over a period of two weeks.</p>
                   
             <p>The success of the Wordsworths&#8217; efforts in circulating requests for funds is
                immediately apparent upon perusal of the subscription book they kept to record
                donations pledged and received. By the middle of May 1808&#8212;just two months after the
                tragedy&#8212;more than £300 had been raised, and by September 1808 almost 300 donors had
                pledged nearly £500. Individual pledges varied, as we would expect, largely
                according to the means of the donor, ranging from the 10 guineas given by both the
                Bishop of Llandaff and Lord Muncaster to offerings of mere sixpences by local
                laboring people and servants, many of whom could probably ill afford even these
                small sums.</p>
                   
            <p>Somewhat surprisingly, so far as the records show, the Wordsworths made no direct
                monetary contribution themselves. This was probably owing to their own straitened
                financial circumstances in 1808 or rationalized in terms of their deciding to retain
                Sally Green after the tragedy instead of letting her go, which had been their plan.
                The Wordsworths&#8217; belief that the charity bestowed upon the Greens had, in some way,
                to be circumscribed is readily apparent in their decision to cap at £500 the funds
                raised for the orphans in order not to raise the children above (or at least
                significantly above) their prior station.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Levy, <title level="a">The Wordsworths, the Greens,</title> 542.</note>
                This led to significant friction with Coleridge, who questioned both the belief that
                the subscription should be capped and the Wordsworths&#8217; decision to sell the entire
                contents of the Greens&#8217; cottage. Other hints of worry over possible unintended
                consequences of assisting the family occur in the <title level="a">Narrative.</title>
                Dorothy, for instance, notes the initial concerns of some genteel women who housed the
                children before their placement in new homes. Fears had been expressed that
                &#8220;wayward desires&#8221; in the children might be raised &#8220;by the luxuries
                among which they had lived for the last three weeks.&#8221; While Dorothy expresses 
                her relief (and that of the other women) &#8220;that [their] fears that this might 
                happen were ill-grounded,&#8221; the articulation of this worry is in itself revealing.</p>
                   
            <p>The Wordsworths were far from unassisted in supervising the collection of funds and
                the placement and upbringing of the Green children. The rector of Grasmere, the
                Reverend Thomas Jackson, agreed to act as trustee, and George Mackereth, the parish
                clerk, was appointed official collector. Six local women&#8212;Mrs. Watson (the wife of
                the Bishop of Llandaff), Mrs. Lloyd (wife of author Charles Lloyd), Mrs. King and
                Mrs. North (both recent settlers in the neighborhood), a Miss Knot, and William&#8217;s
                wife, Mary&#8212;were appointed to superintend the collection of subscriptions, administer
                the funds collected, and oversee the care of the children in their new homes. For
                the next 21 years, until the youngest Green children were able to support
                themselves, the trustees distributed the funds to the families who had taken in the
                younger orphaned children, deservedly earning Ernest de Sélincourt&#8217;s praise as
                &#8220;a model of a simple act of charity wisely conceived and scrupulously 
                administered.&#8221;
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">De Selincourt, <title level="m">A Narrative Concerning George and Sarah Green</title>, 11.</note>
                Surviving collections receipts in the Wordsworth Trustarchives from the woman-led
                effort to finance the children&#8217;s schooling, medical care, and clothing allow
                historians to piece together a vivid portrait of the care of these children. 
                Dorothy&#8217;s <title level="a">Narrative</title> in particular demonstrates how
                the work of charity and caregiving was largely a female endeavor.</p>
                   
            <p>For the most part, these women worked harmoniously in the service of the children.
                Susan Levin has described Dorothy&#8217;s story as &#8220;an affirmation of a certain
                mode of social assistance&#8221; and a &#8220;positive description of a community in 
                which experience and relation of that experience almost conflate.&#8221;

                For Susan Wolfson, Dorothy&#8217;s general &#8220;social sensibility&#8221; throughout
                her prose and poetic works, including the <title level="a">Narrative,</title> 
                differentiates her writing from William&#8217;s &#8220;more solitary poetics.&#8221;
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors">Wolfson, <title level="a">Dorothy Wordsworth in Conversation with William,</title> 154.</note>
                Nevertheless, in the <title level="a">Narrative,</title> Dorothy cannot help criticizing
                one Mrs North, who &#8220;<del rend="strike">cannot do a charitable action without the 
                pleasure of being busy</del>.&#8221; As this strikethrough suggests, Dorothy censors 
                herself, deleting her bitter complaints and canceling her antagonist&#8217;s name. Elsewhere
                in the manuscript she writes, &#8220;I will not blemish a narrative of events so moving,
                which have brought forward so many kind and good feelings, by entering into the cabals 
                and heart-burnings of M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">rs</hi></hi>
                <del rend="strike">North.</del>&#8221; Throughout DCMS 64, Mrs. North&#8217;s name 
                is completely erased, revealing that Dorothy was sufficiently concerned about the
                circulation of the <title level="a">Narrative</title> to accentuate discretion as well as an impression of
                local solidarity.</p>

            <p>The <title level="a">Narrative</title> is a remarkable work of local history, one that 
                utilizes Dorothy&#8217;s talents as a precise and compassionate recorder of speech and
                events. Both a keen observer of and a participant in this crisis, she brings the 
                perspectives of both an outsider and an insider: an outsider in that the Greens, as 
                poor farmers, belonged to a different class and moved in different social circles; and
                an insider in that, as an inhabitant of Grasmere Vale, she possessed a deep understanding
                of the Greens&#8217; way of life and had a firsthand perspective on the aftermath of the
                parents&#8217; untimely deaths.</p>

                Gill&#8221;&#8212;is one of many nods to a knowing audience familiar with Grasmere and
                its environs (see fig. 4.1). While implicitly directed toward a broader, if still localized,
                readership, the more specific addressee of the <title level="a">Narrative</title> appears
                to have been Dorothy&#8217;s good friend Catherine Clarkson. The Clarksons urged Dorothy
                to publish the <title level="a">Narrative,</title> and a complete manuscript copy of the
                text remains in the Clarkson papers at the British Library.
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors">The manuscript copy (DCMS 64) used for our text and all quotations is held by the Wordsworth Trust (see <ref

                Throughout the <title level="a">Narrative,</title> Dorothy draws her anticipated readers
                into the story, inviting them directly to feel compassion for the Greens (&#8220;You will
                wonder how they lived at all and indeed I can scarcely tell you&#8221;), to participate in
                the unfolding of events (&#8220;It would not be easy to give you an idea of the suspense 
                and trouble in every face before the bodies were found&#8221;), and to identify with the 
                charitable actions of those who came to the aid of the orphans (&#8220;You will not wonder,
                after what I have said, that we have been anxious to preserve these Orphans&#8221;). In 
                this way, Dorothy assumes sympathetic readers, though at moments she acknowledges a gap 
                between her own feelings and those of readers like the Clarksons who lived outside the 
                Grasmere community: &#8220;I cannot give <hi rend="underline">you</hi> the same feelings
                that <hi rend="underline">I</hi> have of them as neighbours and fellow-inhabitants of this
                Vale; therefore what is in my mind a full and living picture will be to you but a feeble
                sketch.&#8221;</p>

                
            <p>Dorothy&#8217;s <title level="a">Narrative</title> also assumes a readership familiar with and
                concerned about the fate of small landowners like the Greens who, despite their tireless labor,
                could barely subsist on their land. She describes the Greens as being
                
            <quote>the poorest People in the Vale, though they had a small estate of their own, and a
                Cow. This morsel of Land, now deeply mortgaged had been in the possession of the
                Family for generations, and they were loth to part with it: consequently, they had
                never had any assistance from the Parish.</quote>
                
                Dorothy offers many examples of their extreme poverty&#8212;how George Green, age 65,
                had to do odd jobs for neighbors and dig peat from his own land; how the children were
                hired out to work for local families; how, after their parents&#8217; deaths, the orphans
                were found with no money, little food, and apparently on the edge of starvation:
                
            <quote>They must very soon have parted with their Land if they had lived; for their means
                were reduced by little and little till scarcely anything <hi rend="underline">but</hi>
                the <hi rend="underline">Land</hi> was left. The Cow was grown old; and they had not 
                money to buy another; they had sold their horse; and were in the habit of carrying any
                trifles <del rend="strike">that</del> they could spare out of house or stable to barter
                for potatoes or meal. Luxuries they had none&#8212;they never made tea, and when the 
                Neighbours went to look after the Children they found nothing in the house but two 
                boiling potatoes, a very little meal, a little bread, and three or four legs of lean 
                dried mutton.</quote></p>
                
            <p>In such descriptions, Dorothy revisits an archetype that had figured in her journals
                and her brother&#8217;s poetry&#8212;<title level="a">Michael: A Pastoral Poem</title>
                being the best example of the story of a small landowner (or statesman, as they were 
                called) at risk of losing his land. Michael is forced to make a heartbreaking decision
                between selling his land and sending his son, Luke, to work in the city. Ultimately 
                choosing the latter proves both a terrible and futile decision, terrible because Luke
                becomes dissipated and never returns home, and futile because after his parents&#8217;
                deaths &#8220;the estate / Was sold, and went into a stranger&#8217;s hands&#8221;;
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">WW, <title level="a">Michael,</title> lines 474&#8211;75.</note>
                thus, both Luke and the land are lost. In a journal entry for 18 May 1800, Dorothy
                records a conversation with her neighbor, John Fisher, who similarly describes the
                extinction of the class of small landowners: &#8220;He talked much about the alteration
                in the times, &amp; observed that in a short time there would be only two ranks of
                people, the very rich &amp; the very poor, for those who have small estates says he
                are forced to sell, &amp; all the land goes into one hand.&#8221;

                For Dorothy and her audience, the Greens were similarly situated and equally tragic:
                they represented the passing away of a &#8220;pastoral&#8221; life (to use William&#8217;s
                subtitle), one that seemed increasingly under threat. It may be that drawing the plight
                of these families to public notice was &#8220;the work&#8221; that Thomas Clarkson had
                in mind in urging Dorothy to publish the narrative; a request that prompted her 
                well-known reply to Catherine Clarkson, on 9 December 1810, discussed in detail below.
                    <note place="foot" resp="foot"><title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:453&#8211;455, DW to Catherine Clarkson, 9 December 1810.

            <p>How much did the Wordsworths know about the Greens&#8217; poverty prior to their deaths, 
               and were they willfully blind to it? In a 2003 essay, <title level="a">The Wordsworths, 
               the Greens, and the Limits of Sympathy,</title> I explored the social commentary in the
               <title level="a">Narrative,</title> in particular Dorothy&#8217;s representation of the
               Greens&#8217; poverty and the nature and circumstances of the subscription raised for 
               the children. Two of the main claims advanced in the essay relate to Dorothy&#8217;s
               representation and treatment of the poor. Although Dorothy insists on a number of 
               occasions that she and her family were unaware of the Greens&#8217; extreme deprivation&#8212;
               &#8220;Alas!,&#8221; she writes at one point, &#8220;we gained our knowledge [of their
               extreme poverty] since their death&#8221;&#8212;the <title level="a">Narrative</title>
               also betrays a sense of personal and collective guilt over having, perhaps willfully, 
               ignored so many warning signs. The Wordsworths possibly felt culpable, having had one
               of the older girls, Sally Green, in their service at the time of the tragedy. They knew,
               as Dorothy notes in the text, that &#8220;one of the little Girls, our own Sally or another,
               used to come to fetch [our used tea leaves] two long miles!&#8221; Just before the tragedy,
               the Wordsworths had insisted that the Greens purchase Sally two new shifts, or smocks, to 
               fit her out for service in their house, an expense Dorothy subsequently realized must have
               caused great hardship.</p>
                
            <p>In attending the shop in Ambleside to see if the cloth for these shifts had been paid for 
               after the deaths of George and Sarah Green, and finding that it had, Dorothy reports that 
               many members of the local community had considered the Greens &#8220;rather &#8216;too 
               <hi rend="underline">Stiff,</hi>&#8217; unwilling to receive favours but the
                &#8216;<hi rend="underline">keenest Payers</hi>&#8217;, always in a hurry to pay when they 
               <hi rend="underline">had</hi> money.&#8221; These remarks suggest the impossible situation
               that families like the Greens found themselves in: paying their debts subjected them to 
               being called prideful; yet no doubt they would have been subject to worse insults if they
               had not paid. In an age when accepting charity was considered a sign of weakness, one can
               see how the Greens were in a hopeless predicament. Dorothy is therefore at pains to 
               demonstrate the Greens&#8217; worthiness, an effort to meet the standard that had been
               set for the deserving poor (one that is also found in William&#8217;s short narrative used
               to raise funds for the orphans; see appendix A). In William&#8217;s narrative, compassion
               for the children is &#8220;more deeply felt,&#8221; and &#8220;a general desire that more
               than ordinary exertions should be made&#8221; prevails because of the parents&#8217; 
               &#8220;frugality and industry&#8221; and &#8220;even cheerful endurance of extreme poverty.&#8221; 
               In Dorothy&#8217;s account, she seems less willing to describe the Greens&#8217; suffering 
               as evidence of moral strength, perhaps reflecting her own conflicted views about the treatment
               of the poor generally, and about her family&#8217;s treatment of the Greens specifically. 
               Indeed, in the most significant set of deletions in the <title level="a">Narrative,</title>
               she cancels several lines that embody this understanding of the Greens as willingly suffering
               the burden of poverty:
               
               <quote>… I must say that the general feelings have been purely kind and 
               benevolent, arising from compassion for the forlorn condition of the Orphans and from a 
               respectful regard for the memory of their Parents who <del rend="strike">with unexampled chearfulness, patience
               and self-denial, had supported themselves and their Family in extreme poverty; and</del> have
               left in them a living testimony of their own virtuous conduct: <del rend="strike">for the 
               Children&#8217;s manners (I again repeat it) are of one innocent,</del> [illegible deleted word]
               <del rend="strike">and affectionate in a remarkable degree, so that each of them has already 
               made Friends of</del> [illegible deleted word]. (30)</quote>
                                   
               These cancellations may suggest her inner conflict over such conceptions of the poor.</p>
                
            <p>As noted previously, Dorothy writes the <title level="a">Narrative</title> as a local historian,
               describing a village and way of life in which she is embedded and about which she can be neither
               objective nor disinterested. She documents the mourning of an entire community. Not only does
               she relate her own knowledge of the Greens prior to the tragedy as well as that of others who
               knew them, but she also describes the affecting scenes of the children&#8217;s grief upon learning
               the fate of their parents and their struggles in settling into strange new homes. Much of what
               the <title level="a">Narrative</title> includes consists of what Dorothy describes as the 
               &#8220;fireside talk in our Cottages&#8221;; it is in such domestic settings, she writes, that
               one hears &#8220;the inner histories of Families, their lesser and greater cares, their 
               peculiar habits, and ways of life [that] are recorded in the breasts of their Fellow-inhabitants
               of the Vale.&#8221; In recording this &#8220;fireside talk,&#8221; Dorothy becomes the voice of
               the community, situating herself within a fellowship that not only rallies behind the orphans
               but also implicitly questions whether the village could have done more to help the family 
               before the parents&#8217; death. Dorothy&#8217;s <title level="a">Narrative</title> evokes the 
               shared locality in which they live: Easedale, where the Greens made their home and the Wordsworths
               frequently rambled; the nearby fells upon which the Greens met their fate; the local homes into which
               the orphans are taken, temporarily and permanently. Dorothy is also very much present throughout
               the <title level="a">Narrative</title> as a character who experiences and expresses the sympathy
               on which the story turns. In reflecting on the place where the Greens were lost, she recalls her
               own experience &#8220;at the top of Blea Crag above Easedale Tarn, that very spot where I myself
               had sate down <hi rend="sup">&lt;three&gt;</hi> six years ago, unable to see a yard before me, or
               to go a step further over the Crags.&#8221; Anyone, she suggests, might have shared the Greens&#8217;
               fate, as a mountain-walker like Dorothy had special cause to know.</p>
                
            <p>Dorothy&#8217;s sympathetic connection to the Greens must also have been related to her own status as
               an orphan: Dorothy and William (and their three brothers Richard, John, and Christopher) were, like the
               Green children, bereft of their parents at young ages: their mother died in 1778 and their father in 
               1783. Dorothy and William, again like the Greens, were sent to different relatives after the deaths of
               their parents, not seeing each other for nine years. By 1808, Dorothy had been reunited with her brother
               for nearly a decade, yet she must have keenly understood the pain felt by the Green siblings, many of
               whom were separated though most of them, happily, remained in the same vale. Only the eldest boy, George
               (age 10), was placed with a relative, a half-brother in Ambleside; the rest of the younger Green children
               joined new families. Since, as Dorothy notes, &#8220;It had been declared with one voice by the people of
               the Parish, men and women, that the Infant and her [11-year-old] Sister Jane should not be parted,&#8221;
               they were together placed with a childless couple. The two youngest boys, William (age four) and Thomas
               (age three), both still &#8220;in petticoats,&#8221; were kept together in the home of a family with grown
               children. John (age seven) was taken in by John Fleming, a sheep farmer who had been a friend of his father.
               In contrast to Dorothy&#8217;s own experience as an orphan, being sent to a distant home in Halifax, West
               Yorkshire (and later to others, some welcoming and some less so), the Green children were all kept close
               to their native vale and placed with families that seemed genuinely devoted to them. As Dorothy concluded,
               &#8220;The general feelings have been purely kind and benevolent, arising from compassion for the forlorn
               condition of the Orphans and from a respectful regard for the memory of their Parents.&#8221;</p></div>

               <anchor xml:id="Circulating"/>C. Circulating the <title level="a">Narrative</title> (after Funds Had Been Raised)
           </head>
               
           <p>As detailed in the <ref target="#Textual">Textual and Editorial headnote</ref>, long after funds had been raised
              in aid of the Green children, Dorothy&#8217;s <title level="a">Narrative</title> was read and copied by
              family members and friends, and from very early on, she was urged to publish it. Dorothy&#8217;s response
              to Catherine Clarkson&#8217;s encouragement came in a letter dated 9 December 1810. It is worth quoting in
              full, as her famous refusal&#8212;&#8220;I should detest the idea of setting myself up as an Author&#8221;&#8212;
              is often taken out of context and misconstrued:
                
           <quote>My dear Friend I cannot express what pain I feel in refusing to grant any request of yours, and above all one
              in which dear Mr Clarkson joins so earnestly, but indeed I cannot have that narrative published. My reasons are
              entirely disconnected with myself, much as I should detest the idea of setting myself up as an Author. I should
              not object on that score as if it had been an invention of my own it might have been published without a name,
              and nobody would have thought of me. But on account of the Family of the Greens I cannot consent. Their story
              was only represented to the world in that narrative which was drawn up for the collecting of the subscription,
              so far as might tend to produce the end desired, but by publishing this narrative of mine I should bring the
              children forward to notice as Individuals, and we know not what injurious effect this might have upon them.
              Besides it appears to me that the events are too recent to be published in delicacy to others as well as to
              the children. I should be the more hurt at having to return such an answer to your request, if I could believe
              that the story would be of that service to the work which Mr Clarkson imagines. I cannot believe that it would
              do much for it. Thirty or forty years hence when the Characters of the children are formed and they can be no
              longer objects of curiosity, if it should be thought that any service would be done, it is my present wish that
              it should then be published whether I am alive or dead.

           <lb/>
             
             Dorothy&#8217;s sensitivity to the children&#8217;s privacy trumps even the request of herdear friends, the
             Clarksons, and seems driven by concern that the orphaned children might be harmed, their story sensationalized.</p>
               
          <p>Over thirty years after the deaths of George and Sarah Green, in 1839, Thomas De  Quincey, a well-known author who
             had moved into Dove Cottage after the Wordsworths relocated, revisited the episode in his essay 
             <title level="m">Recollections of Grasmere,</title> which was first published as the September 1839 installment
             of his <title level="m">Tait&#8217;s Edinburgh Magazine</title> series, <title level="a">Sketches of Life and Manners; from
             the Autobiography of an English Opium Eater.</title>
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">It was also republished in the posthumous collection of De Quincey&#8217;s essays, 
                        <title level="m">Recollections of the Lakes and the Lake Poets</title> (1862).</note>
             De Quincey recollects that, after returning from a visit to the Lakes to Oxford in 1808, he received a letter from
             Dorothy &#8220;asking for any subscriptions [he] might succeed in obtaining, amongst [his] college friends, in aid
             of the funds then raising in behalf of an orphan family, who had become such by an affecting tragedy that had occurred
             within a few weeks from [his] visit to Grasmere.&#8221;
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">De Quincey, <title level="a">Sketches of Life and Manners,</title> 1:569.</note>
             Alluding to Dorothy&#8217;s as-yet-unpublished <title level="a">Narrative,</title> he describes how 
             &#8220;Miss Wordsworth&#8217;s simple but fervid memoir not being within my reach at this moment, I
             must trust to my own recollections and my own impressions to retrace the story.&#8221;</p>
                
         <p>De Quincey proceeds with a lengthy, embellished account filled with details of both the Greens&#8217;
            death on the fells and of the children&#8217;s patient suffering that are not included in Dorothy&#8217;s
            account. It is not clear how he came by these details, though he did move to Grasmere in 1809, so it is
            possible he heard them from witnesses. Nevertheless, De Quincey transforms the narrative into melodrama.
            He describes how the Greens had been strongly warned against returning home via Langdale Fell, a point
            never mentioned in Dorothy&#8217;s account, and comments: &#8220;After this they were seen no more. 
            They had disappeared into the cloud of death.&#8221; He also invents the mounting fears of the 
            soon-to-be-orphaned Green children, imagining how &#8220;Every sound, every echo amongst the hills, was
            listened to for five hours, from seven to twelve.&#8221; Further adding a gothic flair to the tale, he
            writes, &#8220;Some time in the course of the evening&#8212;but it was late, and after midnight&#8212;the
            moon arose, and shed a torrent of light upon the Langdale fells, which had already, long before, witnessed
            in darkness the death of their parents.&#8221;</p>
                
         <p>Dorothy, in contrast, describes the children patiently waiting, reasonably assuming their parents had stayed
             overnight in Langdale due to the weather. Whereas Dorothy&#8217;s account evidences a deep communal and human
             connection to the Greens, De Quincey&#8217;s treats this family catastrophe as an occasion for overwrought
             storytelling. At one point, in fact, he confesses to having entertained a party of American visitors &#8220;by
             conducting them through Grasmere into the little inner chamber of Easedale, and there, within sight of the
             solitary cottage, Blentarn Ghyll, telling them the story of the Greens.&#8221;
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">De Quincey, <title level="a">Sketches of Life and Manners,</title> 2:38.</note>
             In other words, albeit decades later, her once-intimate friend De Quincey exploited the Greens&#8217; fate
             much in the way Dorothy feared.</p>
                
         <p>Dorothy&#8217;s account thus remains the most reliable account of this Lakeland tragedy, providing extensive
            details about the lives of the Green family before the death of the parents, the events surrounding their
            deaths, and the community&#8217;s response. In addition to being the most informative, it is the least
            romanticized of the records, and also the most poignant.</p>

            <p>The diplomatic transcription of the <title level="a">Narrative</title> that follows is taken from DCMS
               64, a blue, clothbound notebook in the collections of the Wordsworth Trust. Written on the cover of
               the notebook, in Dorothy&#8217;s hand, is the short title <title level="a">Narrative. The Greens 
               1808.</title> (see fig. 4.2). The notebook begins with a prefatory note by William, dated 11 May
               1808, explaining that the narrative was &#8220;drawn up&#8221; by Dorothy at his request (fig. 4.2).
               William adds that he &#8220;entreated that she would give a <hi rend="underline">minute detail</hi>
               of all the particulars which had come within her notice,&#8221; as a full report would better
               answer &#8220;the end for which the account was written . . . viz. that of leaving behind a record
               of human sympathies, and moral sentiments, either as they were called forth or brought to remembrance&#8221;
               by the tragic deaths of George and Sarah Green in March. On the first page of the <title level="a">Narrative,</title>
               Dorothy provides the full title as <title level="a">A Narrative concerning George &amp; Sarah Green of
               the Parish of Grasmere addressed to a Friend.</title> The notebook contains thirty leaves, and the page
               size varies slightly, averaging approximately 240mm x 190mm (h x w). The notebook appears to have been
               made by a stationer, as the paper board cover is original (fig. 4.2).</p>

            <p>Dorothy&#8217;s <title level="a">Narrative</title> fills the entire rest of the notebook now catalogued
               as DCMS 64. She paginated it from page 2 to the end of the <title level="a">Narrative</title> on page 43.
               After a few blank leaves following the end of the main text, she added four pages of notes. As may be
               seen in figure 4.1, a representative page, the copy is largely fair, suggesting that she was probably
               working from a previous draft, but there are considerable revisions throughout. In our digital edition,
               the text is presented as a diplomatic transcription that respects as much as possible the text and
               layout of the original (including line, paragraph, and page breaks).</p>

            
            <p>Dorothy&#8217;s handwritten revisions within DCMS 64 may be divided into three main categories:</p>
            
                <list rend="numbered">
                    <item>Those she seemingly made while drafting the original or shortly
                        thereafter. All of these changes are minor and reflect immediate
                        second thoughts.</item>
                    
                    <item>Those made in ink at a somewhat later date. Chiefly, these are
                        cancellations of lines or passages like the aforementioned complaints about
                        Mrs. North. She also cancels William and Mary&#8217;s names in one place,
                        substituting &#8220;my brother and sister.&#8221; In another, she replaces
                        &#8220;William&#8221; with &#8220;my brother.&#8221; Further, she softens
                        some descriptions of the Greens that might have been perceived as negative.
                        These revisions and cancels are often made with a noticeably darker ink.</item>
                    
                    <item>Those made in pencil, possibly later still. For the most part, these
                        revisions are insubstantial, making minor corrections or simply recopying
                        the same words (a practice seen in Dorothy&#8217;s other manuscripts). She does,
                        however, add one substantial note in pencil, the final one, which recounts
                        the tragic death of the villager Mary Watson (see note to page 38).</item>
                </list>
            
                <p>In total, there are five known manuscripts of the <title level="a">Narrative.</title>
                    Three are autograph copies, two of which are complete (DCMS 64 and British Library
                    Add MS 41267) and one incomplete (DCMS 51). The remaining two (DCMS 167 and WLMSH/2/5)
                    are transcriptions made by other hands, as described in the following
                    paragraphs. All copies except the British Library autograph are held by the
                    Wordsworth Trust. We have selected DCMS 64 as our copy-text because it is
                    Dorothy&#8217;s personal copy, the one to which she returned to reread and make
                    revisions. The handwriting is fair, with most of the revisions and cancels
                    having been added later, as can be determined by the differences in ink and by
                    the nature of the revisions, most of which appear to have been made to mask the
                    identity of some of the individuals involved, for reasons of tact or clarity.
                    (Such changes were typical of Dorothy, especially when she contemplated
                    publishing her manuscript materials or sharing them with new audiences.) Dorothy
                    also added notes to the end of the <title level="a">Narrative</title> that relate
                    to events that took place many years after 1808. If there had been a preceding
                    draft, it has not survived.</p>
            
                <p>The British Library (BL) copy (Add MS 41267), part of the Clarkson Papers
                    collection, is almost entirely fair, written in a neat hand with very few
                    revisions. Like DCMS 64, it is dated 4 May 1808, but it seems unlikely that
                    Dorothy completed this copy on the same day as she did DCMS 64, meaning she
                    likely just reproduced the date from DCMS 64. As the BL catalogue entry notes,
                    Catherine Clarkson is probably the &#8220;friend&#8221; mentioned in the title
                    and the original dedicatee of the narrative. At the end of a letter dated 9 
                    February 1812, Clarkson writes to Dorothy, &#8220;Don’t forget your promise of
                    giving me a copy of your Narrative in your own hand-writing.&#8221;
                            <note place="foot" resp="editors">Catherine Clarkson to DW, 9 February 1812, cataloged as 
                                f.36 in the Clarkson Papers, Add MS41267 A: 1787&#8211;1853, British Library.</note>
                    Clarkson had certainly read a copy of the <title level="a">Narrative</title>
                    earlier, as is evidenced by her letter of 9 December 1810 urging Dorothy to
                    publish it, but perhaps she never had her own copy prior to 1812. The paper in
                    the BL manuscript of the <title level="a">Narrative</title> is watermarked 1808;
                    however, this tells us only that the text was copied sometime after 1808&#8212;Dorothy
                    might have had the paper for some time. So, it seems likely that the BL
                    <title level="m">Narrative</title> was made after Clarkson&#8217;s
                    1812 request, on paper from 1808, or that Dorothy simply sent Clarkson a copy
                    she had made earlier. Some, but not all, of the revisions to DCMS 64 are
                    duplicated in the BL manuscript, suggesting either that some revisions to the
                    notebook were added after the BL copy had been made or that Dorothy did not wish
                    to retain some of the revisions in the copy.</p>
            
                <p>The only surviving autograph version of the <title level="a">Narrative</title>
                    besides DCMS 64 and the BL copy is an excerpt in DCMS 51, a miscellany in which
                    Dorothy copied various poems and narratives. After including William&#8217;s 
                    inscription and four pages of the <title level="a">Narrative,</title> it ends
                    mid-sentence in a paragraph found in the middle of page 5 of DCMS 64. Like the
                    BL copy, the DCMS 51 version appears to have postdated DCMS 64. It includes only
                    one small correction, made on the first page in the course of copying. It does
                    not include any of what appear to be the later revisions to DCMS 64.</p>
            
                <p>Our edition notes any textual discrepancies between the two complete surviving
                    autograph versions (DCMS 64 and the BL/Clarkson copy). Assuming that DCMS 64 was
                    Dorothy&#8217;s copytext for the BL version, she made minor revisions in the process
                    of transcribing.</p>
            
                <p>One of the two complete contemporaneous copies of the <title level="a">Narrative</title>
                    in other hands, DCMS 167, was, according to a note at its end, &#8220;transcribed by
                    Miss Fletcher now Lady Richardson.&#8221; Mary, Lady Richardson (1802&#8211;1880) lived
                    in Easedale for several years. Her mother, Mrs. Mary Fletcher (1770&#8211;1858) had
                    visited the Lakes on several occasions and in 1839, with the help of William Wordsworth,
                    had purchased, with her husband, Lancrigg Farm in Easedale. Her youngest daughter, Mary,
                    who transcribed the <title level="a">Narrative,</title> lived at the farm with her
                    parents until her marriage in 1847. It is likely that her interest in the Greens&#8217;
                    story came about because the family&#8217;s residence was near the cottage where the
                    Greens had lived (and which remains there today). As the Fletchers did not move to
                    Easedale until 1839, the <title level="a">Narrative</title> was likely not copied until
                    some time later, suggesting ongoing interest in the story. The other con copy, WLMSH/2/5,
                    was transcribed by Mary Wordsworth&#8217;s sister Sara Hutchinson. The year in which this
                    transcript was made is not known.</p>
            
                <p>The number of extant copies demonstrates the significance the <title level="a">Narrative</title>
                    held for the Wordsworths and their social circle, as a document meant to record an important
                    incident in the life of the village but also to travel widely. In 1839, De Quincey reports
                    his understanding that the <title level="a">Narrative</title> &#8220;went into the hands
                    of the royal family; at any rate, the august ladies of that house (all or some of them)
                    were amongst the many subscribers to the orphan children.&#8221;

                    The highest number of complete manuscript copies of a work by Dorothy that survives is five,
                    for the <title level="m">Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland, A.D, 1803</title>.
                    However, the <title level="a">Narrative</title> is a close second with four complete
                    manuscripts and one partial copy. In contrast, Dorothy&#8217;s <title level="m">Journal
                    of a Tour of the Continent, 1820</title> survives in only a single copy, as is the case
                    with her Grasmere journal notebooks, which were evidently not meant to be shared outside
                    of the household.</p>
            
                <p>A November 1850 letter from Mary Wordsworth to her sister-in-law Mary Monkhouse
                    Hutchinson establishes that the <title level="a">Narrative</title> was still being
                    circulated and copied four decades after its composition. Midway through this letter,
                    the then-80-year-old Mary Wordsworth asks whether Monkhouse&#8217;s daughters, Elizabeth
                    and Sarah, had &#8220;ever beg[u]n to copy the Green’s Narrative and if so what they
                    did with it.&#8221; Apparently, Fanny Wordsworth, wife of William Jr., had recently
                    reported, &#8220;Eliz. was about it when she was at Carlisle, and Sarah talked of
                    doing it at the Cooksons.&#8221; Since, as Mary Wordsworth explains, the Green &#8220;family
                    have applied again for it,&#8221; her recently deceased husband&#8217;s long-time clerk,
                    John Carter, &#8220;is ready to make them a Copy, if he hears one is not in forwardness.&#8221;
                            <note place="foot" resp="editors"><title level="m">LMW</title>, 326.</note>
                    The copy eventually sent to the Greens, the present whereabouts of which are unknown,
                    was passed down from John Green&#8212;a seven-year-old at the time of his parents&#8217;
                    death&#8212;to his granddaughter, who wrote about her possession of it in a letter to
                    the Wordsworths&#8217; descendants.</p>
            
               <p>Dorothy would have been highly gratified to have known of the Greens&#8217; fondness
                    for her <title level="a">Narrative,</title> for she had always believed that those who
                    had personal knowledge of the subjects of her writing would be most appreciative of it.
                    This philosophy of writing was one of the reasons she published so little of what she
                    wrote and sometimes struggled to revise her work (like the Scotch tour) to ready
                    it for a wider, public audience. As she told Catherine Clarkson, she supported
                    the publication of the <title level="a">Narrative</title> after the Green children
                    were grown and out of danger of exploitation, and so would probably have approved of
                    Ernest de Sélincourt publishing the first print edition of the <title level="a">Narrative</title>
                    in 1936. Though much more time had passed than the &#8220;thirty or forty years&#8221;
                    Dorothy had asked for it to remain private, she had no objections, as noted previously,
                    to its publication, provided that &#8220;it should be thought that any service would be
                    done.&#8221;

                    William, in his prefatory inscription to the <title level="a">Narrative,</title> makes
                    explicit what this service is: &#8220;that of leaving behind a record of human sympathies,
                    and moral sentiments, either as they were called forth or brought to remembrance, by a 
                    distressful event.&#8221;</p>
