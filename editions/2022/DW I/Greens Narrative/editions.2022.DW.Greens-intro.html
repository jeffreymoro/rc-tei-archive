                  <p>On 19 March 1808, a local married couple, George and Sarah Green, died attempting
                     to cross Langdale Fell on their way home during a storm. They lived at the far end
                     of Easedale, about two miles northwest of the Wordsworths, who were living in Dove
                     Cottage, Town End, Grasmere, at the time and had employed one of the Greens’ daughters,
                     Sally, as a maid. The Greens’ deaths orphaned eight children under the age of 16 and
                     six under age 11, as well as six grown children by previous marriages.

                     the Wordsworths had immediately been “employed in laying schemes to prevent the children
                     from falling into the hands of persons who may use them unkindly.”

                              board them out with Persons who will take them at the cheapest rate; and such as are

                     </div> The specific fear was that the young Greens would suffer the usual fate of orphans,
                     being boarded out by the parish to foster families paid a mere two shillings per week
                     per child. Accordingly, the Wordsworths began to solicit donations, and a brief account
                     of the events was written by William and circulated to those who might be willing
                     to contribute (see appendix A).

                              (Letters, 2: 211–12, 17 April). He and DW wrote letters acknowledging the receipt
                              of funds to Lady Beaumont (Letters, 2:224, 20 April), Richard Sharp (Letters, 2:229–30,

                     to Francis Wrangham dated 17 April 1808, apologizes for the “dim transcript made by
                     a multiplying writer, we having had occasion to make so many copies.”

                     on 19 April 1808, included a copy of a short poem he had written entitled 
                     “Elegiac Stanzas composed in the Churchyard of Grasmere, Westmorland, a few days after
                     the Internment there of a Man and his Wife, Inhabitants of the Vale, who were lost
                     upon the neighbouring Mountains, on the night of the nineteenth of March last”
                      (see appendix B).

                     </div> William urged Coleridge, who was then in London delivering a series of lectures, to
                     “turn these verses to any profit for the poor Orphans in any way, either by reciting,
                     circulating in manuscript or publishing them.” William also explained, “As soon as
                     she has leisure Dorothy means to draw up a minute detail of all that she knows concerning
                     the lives and characters of the Husband and Wife, and everything relating to their
                     melancholy end, and its effect upon the Inhabitants of this Vale; a story that will
                     be rich both in pleasure and profit.” Dorothy, in fact, had begun drafting her own
                     record at roughly this same time, as evidenced by her noting near the beginning of
                     her account, “It was a month yesterday since the sad event happened.”

                     “Narrative”
                      is signed and dated 4 May 1808, suggesting that Dorothy completed it over a period
                     of two weeks.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The success of the Wordsworths’ efforts in circulating requests for funds is immediately
                  apparent upon perusal of the subscription book they kept to record donations pledged
                  and received. By the middle of May 1808—just two months after the tragedy—more than
                  £300 had been raised, and by September 1808 almost 300 donors had pledged nearly £500.
                  Individual pledges varied, as we would expect, largely according to the means of the
                  donor, ranging from the 10 guineas given by both the Bishop of Llandaff and Lord Muncaster
                  to offerings of mere sixpences by local laboring people and servants, many of whom
                  could probably ill afford even these small sums.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Somewhat surprisingly, so far as the records show, the Wordsworths made no direct
                     monetary contribution themselves. This was probably owing to their own straitened
                     financial circumstances in 1808 or rationalized in terms of their deciding to retain
                     Sally Green after the tragedy instead of letting her go, which had been their plan.
                     The Wordsworths’ belief that the charity bestowed upon the Greens had, in some way,
                     to be circumscribed is readily apparent in their decision to cap at £500 the funds
                     raised for the orphans in order not to raise the children above (or at least significantly
                     above) their prior station.

                              “The Wordsworths, the Greens,”

                     </div> This led to significant friction with Coleridge, who questioned both the belief that
                     the subscription should be capped and the Wordsworths’ decision to sell the entire
                     contents of the Greens’ cottage. Other hints of worry over possible unintended consequences
                     of assisting the family occur in the 
                     “Narrative.”
                      Dorothy, for instance, notes the initial concerns of some genteel women who housed
                     the children before their placement in new homes. Fears had been expressed that “wayward
                     desires” in the children might be raised “by the luxuries among which they had lived
                     for the last three weeks.” While Dorothy expresses her relief (and that of the other
                     women) “that [their] fears that this might happen were ill-grounded,” the articulation
                     of this worry is in itself revealing.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The Wordsworths were far from unassisted in supervising the collection of funds and
                     the placement and upbringing of the Green children. The rector of Grasmere, the Reverend
                     Thomas Jackson, agreed to act as trustee, and George Mackereth, the parish clerk,
                     was appointed official collector. Six local women—Mrs. Watson (the wife of the Bishop
                     of Llandaff), Mrs. Lloyd (wife of author Charles Lloyd), Mrs. King and Mrs. North
                     (both recent settlers in the neighborhood), a Miss Knot, and William’s wife, Mary—were
                     appointed to superintend the collection of subscriptions, administer the funds collected,
                     and oversee the care of the children in their new homes. For the next 21 years, until
                     the youngest Green children were able to support themselves, the trustees distributed
                     the funds to the families who had taken in the younger orphaned children, deservedly
                     earning Ernest de Sélincourt’s praise as “a model of a simple act of charity wisely
                     conceived and scrupulously administered.”

                     and canceling her antagonist’s name. Elsewhere in the manuscript she writes, “I will

                     scarcely tell you”), to participate in the unfolding of events (“It would not be easy

                     of the orphans (“You will not wonder, after what I have said, that we have been anxious
                     to preserve these Orphans”). In this way, Dorothy assumes sympathetic readers, though
                     at moments she acknowledges a gap between her own feelings and those of readers like
                     the Clarksons who lived outside the Grasmere community: “I cannot give <span style="text-decoration:underline">you</span> the same feelings that <span style="text-decoration:underline">I</span> have of them as neighbours and fellow-inhabitants of this Vale; therefore what is
                     in my mind a full and living picture will be to you but a feeble sketch.”</p>
               </div>
               <p>Dorothy’s 
                  “Narrative”
                  also assumes a readership familiar with and concerned about the fate of small landowners
                  like the Greens who, despite their tireless labor, could barely subsist on their land.
                  She describes the Greens as being <span class="quote">‘the poorest People in the Vale, though they had a small estate of their own, and
                     a Cow. This morsel of Land, now deeply mortgaged had been in the possession of the
                     Family for generations, and they were loth to part with it: consequently, they had
                     never had any assistance from the Parish.’</span> Dorothy offers many examples of their extreme poverty—how George Green, age 65, had
                  to do odd jobs for neighbors and dig peat from his own land; how the children were
                  hired out to work for local families; how, after their parents’ deaths, the orphans
                  were found with no money, little food, and apparently on the edge of starvation: <span class="quote">‘They must very soon have parted with their Land if they had lived; for their means
                     were reduced by little and little till scarcely anything <span style="text-decoration:underline">but</span> the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Land</span> was left. The Cow was grown old; and they had not money to buy another; they had
                     sold their horse; and were in the habit of carrying any trifles <span style="text-decoration: line-through">that</span> they could spare out of house or stable to barter for potatoes or meal. Luxuries
                     they had none—they never made tea, and when the Neighbours went to look after the
                     Children they found nothing in the house but two boiling potatoes, a very little meal,
                     a little bread, and three or four legs of lean dried mutton.’</span></p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In such descriptions, Dorothy revisits an archetype that had figured in her journals
                     and her brother’s poetry—
                     “Michael: A Pastoral Poem”
                      being the best example of the story of a small landowner (or statesman, as they were
                     called) at risk of losing his land. Michael is forced to make a heartbreaking decision
                     between selling his land and sending his son, Luke, to work in the city. Ultimately
                     choosing the latter proves both a terrible and futile decision, terrible because Luke
                     becomes dissipated and never returns home, and futile because after his parents’ deaths
                     “the estate / Was sold, and went into a stranger’s hands”;

                     records a conversation with her neighbor, John Fisher, who similarly describes the
                     extinction of the class of small landowners: “He talked much about the alteration
                     in the times, &amp; observed that in a short time there would be only two ranks of people,

                     one that seemed increasingly under threat. It may be that drawing the plight of these
                     families to public notice was “the work” that Thomas Clarkson had in mind in urging
                     Dorothy to publish the narrative; a request that prompted her well-known reply to

               <p>How much did the Wordsworths know about the Greens’ poverty prior to their deaths,
                  and were they willfully blind to it? In a 2003 essay, 
                  “The Wordsworths, the Greens, and the Limits of Sympathy,”
                  I explored the social commentary in the 
                  “Narrative,”
                  in particular Dorothy’s representation of the Greens’ poverty and the nature and circumstances
                  of the subscription raised for the children. Two of the main claims advanced in the
                  essay relate to Dorothy’s representation and treatment of the poor. Although Dorothy
                  insists on a number of occasions that she and her family were unaware of the Greens’
                  extreme deprivation— “Alas!,” she writes at one point, “we gained our knowledge [of
                  their extreme poverty] since their death”—the 
                  “Narrative”
                  also betrays a sense of personal and collective guilt over having, perhaps willfully,
                  ignored so many warning signs. The Wordsworths possibly felt culpable, having had
                  one of the older girls, Sally Green, in their service at the time of the tragedy.
                  They knew, as Dorothy notes in the text, that “one of the little Girls, our own Sally
                  or another, used to come to fetch [our used tea leaves] two long miles!” Just before
                  the tragedy, the Wordsworths had insisted that the Greens purchase Sally two new shifts,
                  or smocks, to fit her out for service in their house, an expense Dorothy subsequently
                  realized must have caused great hardship.</p>
               <p>In attending the shop in Ambleside to see if the cloth for these shifts had been paid
                  for after the deaths of George and Sarah Green, and finding that it had, Dorothy reports
                  that many members of the local community had considered the Greens “rather ‘too <span style="text-decoration:underline">Stiff,</span>’ unwilling to receive favours but the ‘<span style="text-decoration:underline">keenest Payers</span>’, always in a hurry to pay when they <span style="text-decoration:underline">had</span> money.” These remarks suggest the impossible situation that families like the Greens
                  found themselves in: paying their debts subjected them to being called prideful; yet
                  no doubt they would have been subject to worse insults if they had not paid. In an
                  age when accepting charity was considered a sign of weakness, one can see how the
                  Greens were in a hopeless predicament. Dorothy is therefore at pains to demonstrate
                  the Greens’ worthiness, an effort to meet the standard that had been set for the deserving
                  poor (one that is also found in William’s short narrative used to raise funds for
                  the orphans; see appendix A). In William’s narrative, compassion for the children
                  is “more deeply felt,” and “a general desire that more than ordinary exertions should
                  be made” prevails because of the parents’ “frugality and industry” and “even cheerful
                  endurance of extreme poverty.” In Dorothy’s account, she seems less willing to describe
                  the Greens’ suffering as evidence of moral strength, perhaps reflecting her own conflicted
                  views about the treatment of the poor generally, and about her family’s treatment
                  of the Greens specifically. Indeed, in the most significant set of deletions in the
                  
                  “Narrative,”
                  she cancels several lines that embody this understanding of the Greens as willingly
                  suffering the burden of poverty: <span class="quote">‘… I must say that the general feelings have been purely kind and benevolent, arising
                     from compassion for the forlorn condition of the Orphans and from a respectful regard
                     for the memory of their Parents who <span style="text-decoration: line-through">with unexampled chearfulness, patience and self-denial, had supported themselves and
                        their Family in extreme poverty; and</span> have left in them a living testimony of their own virtuous conduct: <span style="text-decoration: line-through">for the Children’s manners (I again repeat it) are of one innocent,</span> [illegible deleted word] <span style="text-decoration: line-through">and affectionate in a remarkable degree, so that each of them has already made Friends
                        of</span> [illegible deleted word]. (30)’</span> These cancellations may suggest her inner conflict over such conceptions of the poor.</p>
               <p>As noted previously, Dorothy writes the 
                  “Narrative”
                  as a local historian, describing a village and way of life in which she is embedded
                  and about which she can be neither objective nor disinterested. She documents the
                  mourning of an entire community. Not only does she relate her own knowledge of the
                  Greens prior to the tragedy as well as that of others who knew them, but she also
                  describes the affecting scenes of the children’s grief upon learning the fate of their
                  parents and their struggles in settling into strange new homes. Much of what the 
                  “Narrative”
                  includes consists of what Dorothy describes as the “fireside talk in our Cottages”;
                  it is in such domestic settings, she writes, that one hears “the inner histories of
                  Families, their lesser and greater cares, their peculiar habits, and ways of life
                  [that] are recorded in the breasts of their Fellow-inhabitants of the Vale.” In recording
                  this “fireside talk,” Dorothy becomes the voice of the community, situating herself
                  within a fellowship that not only rallies behind the orphans but also implicitly questions
                  whether the village could have done more to help the family before the parents’ death.
                  Dorothy’s 
                  “Narrative”
                  evokes the shared locality in which they live: Easedale, where the Greens made their
                  home and the Wordsworths frequently rambled; the nearby fells upon which the Greens
                  met their fate; the local homes into which the orphans are taken, temporarily and
                  permanently. Dorothy is also very much present throughout the 
                  “Narrative”
                  as a character who experiences and expresses the sympathy on which the story turns.
                  In reflecting on the place where the Greens were lost, she recalls her own experience
                  “at the top of Blea Crag above Easedale Tarn, that very spot where I myself had sate
                  down <span>⟨&lt;three&gt;⟩</span> six years ago, unable to see a yard before me, or to go a step further over the Crags.”
                  Anyone, she suggests, might have shared the Greens’ fate, as a mountain-walker like
                  Dorothy had special cause to know.</p>
               <p>Dorothy’s sympathetic connection to the Greens must also have been related to her
                  own status as an orphan: Dorothy and William (and their three brothers Richard, John,
                  and Christopher) were, like the Green children, bereft of their parents at young ages:
                  their mother died in 1778 and their father in 1783. Dorothy and William, again like
                  the Greens, were sent to different relatives after the deaths of their parents, not
                  seeing each other for nine years. By 1808, Dorothy had been reunited with her brother
                  for nearly a decade, yet she must have keenly understood the pain felt by the Green
                  siblings, many of whom were separated though most of them, happily, remained in the
                  same vale. Only the eldest boy, George (age 10), was placed with a relative, a half-brother
                  in Ambleside; the rest of the younger Green children joined new families. Since, as
                  Dorothy notes, “It had been declared with one voice by the people of the Parish, men
                  and women, that the Infant and her [11-year-old] Sister Jane should not be parted,”
                  they were together placed with a childless couple. The two youngest boys, William
                  (age four) and Thomas (age three), both still “in petticoats,” were kept together
                  in the home of a family with grown children. John (age seven) was taken in by John
                  Fleming, a sheep farmer who had been a friend of his father. In contrast to Dorothy’s
                  own experience as an orphan, being sent to a distant home in Halifax, West Yorkshire
                  (and later to others, some welcoming and some less so), the Green children were all
                  kept close to their native vale and placed with families that seemed genuinely devoted
                  to them. As Dorothy concluded, “The general feelings have been purely kind and benevolent,
                  arising from compassion for the forlorn condition of the Orphans and from a respectful
                  regard for the memory of their Parents.”</p>

                  <p>As detailed in the <a class="link_ref" href="#Textual" title="">Textual and Editorial headnote</a>, long after funds had been raised in aid of the Green children, Dorothy’s 
                     “Narrative”
                      was read and copied by family members and friends, and from very early on, she was
                     urged to publish it. Dorothy’s response to Catherine Clarkson’s encouragement came
                     in a letter dated 9 December 1810. It is worth quoting in full, as her famous refusal—“I
                     should detest the idea of setting myself up as an Author”— is often taken out of context
                     and misconstrued: <span class="quote">‘My dear Friend I cannot express what pain I feel in refusing to grant any request
                        of yours, and above all one in which dear Mr Clarkson joins so earnestly, but indeed
                        I cannot have that narrative published. My reasons are entirely disconnected with
                        myself, much as I should detest the idea of setting myself up as an Author. I should
                        not object on that score as if it had been an invention of my own it might have been
                        published without a name, and nobody would have thought of me. But on account of the
                        Family of the Greens I cannot consent. Their story was only represented to the world
                        in that narrative which was drawn up for the collecting of the subscription, so far
                        as might tend to produce the end desired, but by publishing this narrative of mine
                        I should bring the children forward to notice as Individuals, and we know not what
                        injurious effect this might have upon them. Besides it appears to me that the events
                        are too recent to be published in delicacy to others as well as to the children. I
                        should be the more hurt at having to return such an answer to your request, if I could
                        believe that the story would be of that service to the work which Mr Clarkson imagines.
                        I cannot believe that it would do much for it. Thirty or forty years hence when the
                        Characters of the children are formed and they can be no longer objects of curiosity,
                        if it should be thought that any service would be done, it is my present wish that
                        it should then be published whether I am alive or dead.

                  <p>Over thirty years after the deaths of George and Sarah Green, in 1839, Thomas De Quincey,
                     a well-known author who had moved into Dove Cottage after the Wordsworths relocated,
                     revisited the episode in his essay <em>Recollections of Grasmere,</em> which was first published as the September 1839 installment of his <em>Tait’s Edinburgh Magazine</em> series, 
                     “Sketches of Life and Manners; from the Autobiography of an English Opium Eater.”

                     of an orphan family, who had become such by an affecting tragedy that had occurred

                     </div> Alluding to Dorothy’s as-yet-unpublished 
                     “Narrative,”
                      he describes how “Miss Wordsworth’s simple but fervid memoir not being within my reach
                     at this moment, I must trust to my own recollections and my own impressions to retrace
                     the story.”</p>
               </div>
               <p>De Quincey proceeds with a lengthy, embellished account filled with details of both
                  the Greens’ death on the fells and of the children’s patient suffering that are not
                  included in Dorothy’s account. It is not clear how he came by these details, though
                  he did move to Grasmere in 1809, so it is possible he heard them from witnesses. Nevertheless,
                  De Quincey transforms the narrative into melodrama. He describes how the Greens had
                  been strongly warned against returning home via Langdale Fell, a point never mentioned
                  in Dorothy’s account, and comments: “After this they were seen no more. They had disappeared
                  into the cloud of death.” He also invents the mounting fears of the soon-to-be-orphaned
                  Green children, imagining how “Every sound, every echo amongst the hills, was listened
                  to for five hours, from seven to twelve.” Further adding a gothic flair to the tale,
                  he writes, “Some time in the course of the evening—but it was late, and after midnight—the
                  moon arose, and shed a torrent of light upon the Langdale fells, which had already,
                  long before, witnessed in darkness the death of their parents.”</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Dorothy, in contrast, describes the children patiently waiting, reasonably assuming
                     their parents had stayed overnight in Langdale due to the weather. Whereas Dorothy’s
                     account evidences a deep communal and human connection to the Greens, De Quincey’s
                     treats this family catastrophe as an occasion for overwrought storytelling. At one
                     point, in fact, he confesses to having entertained a party of American visitors “by
                     conducting them through Grasmere into the little inner chamber of Easedale, and there,
                     within sight of the solitary cottage, Blentarn Ghyll, telling them the story of the
                     Greens.”

               <p>The diplomatic transcription of the 
                  “Narrative”
                  that follows is taken from DCMS 64, a blue, clothbound notebook in the collections
                  of the Wordsworth Trust. Written on the cover of the notebook, in Dorothy’s hand,
                  is the short title 
                  “Narrative. The Greens 1808.”
                  (see fig. 4.2). The notebook begins with a prefatory note by William, dated 11 May
                  1808, explaining that the narrative was “drawn up” by Dorothy at his request (fig.
                  4.2). William adds that he “entreated that she would give a <span style="text-decoration:underline">minute detail</span> of all the particulars which had come within her notice,” as a full report would
                  better answer “the end for which the account was written . . . viz. that of leaving
                  behind a record of human sympathies, and moral sentiments, either as they were called
                  forth or brought to remembrance” by the tragic deaths of George and Sarah Green in
                  March. On the first page of the 
                  “Narrative,”
                  Dorothy provides the full title as 
                  “A Narrative concerning George &amp; Sarah Green of the Parish of Grasmere addressed to
                  a Friend.”
                  The notebook contains thirty leaves, and the page size varies slightly, averaging
                  approximately 240mm x 190mm (h x w). The notebook appears to have been made by a stationer,
                  as the paper board cover is original (fig. 4.2).</p>

               <p>Dorothy’s 
                  “Narrative”
                  fills the entire rest of the notebook now catalogued as DCMS 64. She paginated it
                  from page 2 to the end of the 
                  “Narrative”
                  on page 43. After a few blank leaves following the end of the main text, she added
                  four pages of notes. As may be seen in figure 4.1, a representative page, the copy
                  is largely fair, suggesting that she was probably working from a previous draft, but
                  there are considerable revisions throughout. In our digital edition, the text is presented
                  as a diplomatic transcription that respects as much as possible the text and layout
                  of the original (including line, paragraph, and page breaks).</p>
               <p>Dorothy’s handwritten revisions within DCMS 64 may be divided into three main categories:</p>
               <ol class="numbered">
                  <li class="item" id="d30e619">Those she seemingly made while drafting the original or shortly thereafter. All of
                     these changes are minor and reflect immediate second thoughts.</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d30e620">Those made in ink at a somewhat later date. Chiefly, these are cancellations of lines
                     or passages like the aforementioned complaints about Mrs. North. She also cancels
                     William and Mary’s names in one place, substituting “my brother and sister.” In another,
                     she replaces “William” with “my brother.” Further, she softens some descriptions of
                     the Greens that might have been perceived as negative. These revisions and cancels
                     are often made with a noticeably darker ink.</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d30e621">Those made in pencil, possibly later still. For the most part, these revisions are
                     insubstantial, making minor corrections or simply recopying the same words (a practice
                     seen in Dorothy’s other manuscripts). She does, however, add one substantial note
                     in pencil, the final one, which recounts the tragic death of the villager Mary Watson
                     (see note to page 38).</li>
               </ol>
               <p>In total, there are five known manuscripts of the 
                  “Narrative.”
                  Three are autograph copies, two of which are complete (DCMS 64 and British Library
                  Add MS 41267) and one incomplete (DCMS 51). The remaining two (DCMS 167 and WLMSH/2/5)
                  are transcriptions made by other hands, as described in the following paragraphs.
                  All copies except the British Library autograph are held by the Wordsworth Trust.
                  We have selected DCMS 64 as our copy-text because it is Dorothy’s personal copy, the
                  one to which she returned to reread and make revisions. The handwriting is fair, with
                  most of the revisions and cancels having been added later, as can be determined by
                  the differences in ink and by the nature of the revisions, most of which appear to
                  have been made to mask the identity of some of the individuals involved, for reasons
                  of tact or clarity. (Such changes were typical of Dorothy, especially when she contemplated
                  publishing her manuscript materials or sharing them with new audiences.) Dorothy also
                  added notes to the end of the 
                  “Narrative”
                  that relate to events that took place many years after 1808. If there had been a preceding
                  draft, it has not survived.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The British Library (BL) copy (Add MS 41267), part of the Clarkson Papers collection,
                     is almost entirely fair, written in a neat hand with very few revisions. Like DCMS
                     64, it is dated 4 May 1808, but it seems unlikely that Dorothy completed this copy
                     on the same day as she did DCMS 64, meaning she likely just reproduced the date from
                     DCMS 64. As the BL catalogue entry notes, Catherine Clarkson is probably the “friend”
                     mentioned in the title and the original dedicatee of the narrative. At the end of
                     a letter dated 9 February 1812, Clarkson writes to Dorothy, “Don’t forget your promise
                     of giving me a copy of your Narrative in your own hand-writing.”

                     </div> Clarkson had certainly read a copy of the 
                     “Narrative”
                      earlier, as is evidenced by her letter of 9 December 1810 urging Dorothy to publish
                     it, but perhaps she never had her own copy prior to 1812. The paper in the BL manuscript
                     of the 
                     “Narrative”
                      is watermarked 1808; however, this tells us only that the text was copied sometime
                     after 1808—Dorothy might have had the paper for some time. So, it seems likely that
                     the BL <em>Narrative</em> was made after Clarkson’s 1812 request, on paper from 1808, or that Dorothy simply
                     sent Clarkson a copy she had made earlier. Some, but not all, of the revisions to
                     DCMS 64 are duplicated in the BL manuscript, suggesting either that some revisions
                     to the notebook were added after the BL copy had been made or that Dorothy did not
                     wish to retain some of the revisions in the copy.</p>

                  besides DCMS 64 and the BL copy is an excerpt in DCMS 51, a miscellany in which Dorothy
                  copied various poems and narratives. After including William’s inscription and four
                  pages of the 
                  “Narrative,”
                  it ends mid-sentence in a paragraph found in the middle of page 5 of DCMS 64. Like
                  the BL copy, the DCMS 51 version appears to have postdated DCMS 64. It includes only
                  one small correction, made on the first page in the course of copying. It does not
                  include any of what appear to be the later revisions to DCMS 64.</p>
               <p>Our edition notes any textual discrepancies between the two complete surviving autograph
                  versions (DCMS 64 and the BL/Clarkson copy). Assuming that DCMS 64 was Dorothy’s copytext
                  for the BL version, she made minor revisions in the process of transcribing.</p>
               <p>One of the two complete contemporaneous copies of the 
                  “Narrative”
                  in other hands, DCMS 167, was, according to a note at its end, “transcribed by Miss
                  Fletcher now Lady Richardson.” Mary, Lady Richardson (1802–1880) lived in Easedale
                  for several years. Her mother, Mrs. Mary Fletcher (1770–1858) had visited the Lakes
                  on several occasions and in 1839, with the help of William Wordsworth, had purchased,
                  with her husband, Lancrigg Farm in Easedale. Her youngest daughter, Mary, who transcribed
                  the 
                  “Narrative,”
                  lived at the farm with her parents until her marriage in 1847. It is likely that her
                  interest in the Greens’ story came about because the family’s residence was near the
                  cottage where the Greens had lived (and which remains there today). As the Fletchers
                  did not move to Easedale until 1839, the 
                  “Narrative”
                  was likely not copied until some time later, suggesting ongoing interest in the story.
                  The other con copy, WLMSH/2/5, was transcribed by Mary Wordsworth’s sister Sara Hutchinson.
                  The year in which this transcript was made is not known.</p>

                  <p>The number of extant copies demonstrates the significance the 
                     “Narrative”
                      held for the Wordsworths and their social circle, as a document meant to record an
                     important incident in the life of the village but also to travel widely. In 1839,
                     De Quincey reports his understanding that the 
                     “Narrative”
                      “went into the hands of the royal family; at any rate, the august ladies of that house
                     (all or some of them) were amongst the many subscribers to the orphan children.”

                     is five, for the <em>Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland, A.D, 1803</em>. However, the 
                     “Narrative”
                      is a close second with four complete manuscripts and one partial copy. In contrast,
                     Dorothy’s <em>Journal of a Tour of the Continent, 1820</em> survives in only a single copy, as is the case with her Grasmere journal notebooks,
                     which were evidently not meant to be shared outside of the household.</p>

                  <p>A November 1850 letter from Mary Wordsworth to her sister-in-law Mary Monkhouse Hutchinson
                     establishes that the 
                     “Narrative”
                      was still being circulated and copied four decades after its composition. Midway through
                     this letter, the then-80-year-old Mary Wordsworth asks whether Monkhouse’s daughters,
                     Elizabeth and Sarah, had “ever beg[u]n to copy the Green’s Narrative and if so what
                     they did with it.” Apparently, Fanny Wordsworth, wife of William Jr., had recently
                     reported, “Eliz. was about it when she was at Carlisle, and Sarah talked of doing
                     it at the Cooksons.” Since, as Mary Wordsworth explains, the Green “family have applied
                     again for it,” her recently deceased husband’s long-time clerk, John Carter, “is ready
                     to make them a Copy, if he hears one is not in forwardness.”

                     was passed down from John Green—a seven-year-old at the time of his parents’ death—to
                     his granddaughter, who wrote about her possession of it in a letter to the Wordsworths’
                     descendants.</p>

                  <p>Dorothy would have been highly gratified to have known of the Greens’ fondness for
                     her 
                     “Narrative,”
                      for she had always believed that those who had personal knowledge of the subjects
                     of her writing would be most appreciative of it. This philosophy of writing was one
                     of the reasons she published so little of what she wrote and sometimes struggled to
                     revise her work (like the Scotch tour) to ready it for a wider, public audience. As
                     she told Catherine Clarkson, she supported the publication of the 
                     “Narrative”
                      after the Green children were grown and out of danger of exploitation, and so would
                     probably have approved of Ernest de Sélincourt publishing the first print edition
                     of the 
                     “Narrative”
                      in 1936. Though much more time had passed than the “thirty or forty years” Dorothy
                     had asked for it to remain private, she had no objections, as noted previously, to
                     its publication, provided that “it should be thought that any service would be done.”
