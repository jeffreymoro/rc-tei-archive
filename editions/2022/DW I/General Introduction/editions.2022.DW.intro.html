                  <p>On Christmas Day of 2021, admirers of Dorothy Wordsworth (1771–1855) around the world
                     celebrated the sestercentennial of a writer who, after long years in her elder brother’s
                     shadow, has at last gained an independent reputation. Dorothy (fig. 1) is now widely
                     known as one of nineteenth-century England’s most perspicacious nature writers and
                     keen-eyed chroniclers of the everyday. There has never been a better time to study
                     her life and work, as besides an ever-growing body of biographical and critical studies,
                     recent decades have seen the arrival of several important print collections of her
                     writings, including the first-ever classroom anthology of her “greatest hits” as a
                     diarist, travel writer, and poet.

               <p>Even in the wake of such advances, <em>Dorothy Wordsworth’s Lake District</em> represents a major step forward for both the general availability and scholarly study
                  of her remarkable journals, poems, and travel writings. While more a topical anthology
                  than complete works edition, this Romantic Circles Electronic Edition offers by far
                  the most extensively annotated and meticulously transcribed collection of Dorothy’s
                  texts to date. Its central thematic focus is the deep connection, at once aesthetic,
                  affective, and spiritual, that this most observant of writers felt with the people
                  and scenery of her native Lake District. Yet, even while concentrated on a single
                  region, this edition might also be taken as a general introduction to Dorothy’s writings,
                  as it samples widely from her output in a range of genres and across all phases of
                  her adult life, featuring both well-known works like her Grasmere journal notebooks
                  and others that have either never before been published or never appeared in a reliable
                  edition. Several texts, moreover, appear in multiple versions, and all are introduced
                  with critical essays and headnotes explaining their composition, reception, and biographical
                  and historical contexts.</p>
               <p>To cater to specialized scholars and general readers alike, we have divided our prefatory
                  material into two parts. This introduction reviews the pertinent aspects of Dorothy’s
                  life, our rationale for focusing on her Lakeland writings, and the edition’s contents.
                  A separate essay on our <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/dw/editions.2022.dw.ed-phil.html">“Editorial Philosophy  and Guidelines”</a> situates this project within the history of editing women writers in general and
                  Dorothy Wordsworth in particular, articulates the advantages of publishing such an
                  edition in an open-access digital format, and summarizes our editorial practices and

               <h2><span class="head">A Life in the Lakes</span></h2>
               <p>The third of John and Ann Wordsworth’s five eventual children, and their only daughter,
                  Dorothy Wordsworth was born on 25 December 1771 in Cockermouth, Cumberland, a town
                  in the northwest corner of the English Lake District (fig. 2). After six happy years
                  with her parents and brothers, she suddenly found her comfortable childhood upended
                  by her mother’s passing in early 1778. While her brothers would remain in the Lakes,
                  staying with relatives when not attending Hawkshead Grammar School, Dorothy would
                  largely be exiled from the region for over two decades, spending most of her formative
                  years with relatives in Halifax, Yorkshire (1778–1787) and Forncett, Norfolk (1788–1794).
                  An 18-month stay with her maternal grandparents in Penrith in 1787–1788 did little
                  to ease her sense of displacement, though it did rekindle her love for the region’s
                  beauty and yield lifelong friendships, especially with her future sister-in-law, Mary
                  Hutchinson.</p>

                  <p>For good reason, then, virtually every biographer has stressed the joy and relief
                     Dorothy felt in her mid-to-late 20s upon reconnecting with her siblings and returning
                     to her native Cumbria. What is generally considered the happiest period of her life
                     began in 1795, when she and William, the brother 20 months her senior to whom she
                     had always felt especially close, were finally able to live under the same roof. Four
                     years later, after sojourns in the south of England and in Germany, they and their
                     younger brother John began planning to establish a permanent home in the Lakes. While
                     touring the Lake District with Samuel Taylor Coleridge in November 1799, William reported
                     to Dorothy that “C[oleridge] was much struck with Grasmere and its neighbourhood and
                     I have much to say to you[;] you will think my plan a mad one, but I have thought
                     of building a house there by the Lake side. John would give me #40 to buy the ground,
                     and for #250 I am sure I could build one as good as we can wish.”
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                              (3)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Letters, 1:272.</span></div>
                     </div> This vision clearly outpaced their finances, as William and Dorothy were tight on
                     funds and John was just launching his career as a merchant sailor. Nevertheless, the
                     siblings were so taken with the prospect of making a home together in Grasmere that
                     by the year’s end William and Dorothy had taken a lease on the home now known as Dove
                     Cottage and John had promised to join them on his next shore leave.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Lucy Newlyn recently observed that, “returning to the Lake District to reclaim their
                     regional identity and reestablish their family, the Wordsworths found themselves at
                     one remove from their childhood origins—neither insiders nor quite outsiders in Grasmere.”
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                              (4)

                     </div> Yet any such dual consciousness was likely felt more acutely by Dorothy than her brothers,
                     as, unlike them, she had not spent her formative years attending school just south
                     of Grasmere in Hawkshead. Accordingly, her distinctive position as an insider-outsider
                     in the Central Lakes frequently shows through in earlier selections in this edition
                     (especially the first journal notebook), which display a deep curiosity about the
                     area’s society, topography, and plant and animal species and speak in the voice of
                     one making the transition from tourist to longtime resident.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>While William and Dorothy would never build the dream house they began imagining in
                     1799, their other wish, to establish a permanent home in the area, was fulfilled entirely.
                     Dove Cottage served as their cramped but cherished abode from December 1799 through
                     May 1808, a period when the siblings composed many of their most iconic works and
                     were joined first by Mary Hutchinson, whom William married in October 1802, and then
                     by the couple’s first three children. Famously, these were years of “plain living
                     and high thinking,”

                     Dove Cottage, the family spent three years at Allan Bank in Grasmere, where William
                     and Mary’s two youngest children were born, followed by two years in the village rectory
                     (figures 3–4). Then, in May 1813, after William secured a government post that significantly
                     eased the family’s money worries, they moved two miles east of Grasmere to Rydal Mount,
                     the spacious and comfortable home in which William, Mary, and Dorothy would reside
                     until their respective deaths in the 1850s.</p>

               <p>The Wordsworths’ Grasmere period is rightly celebrated in the annals of British literature.
                  But if, as traditional accounts suggest, William’s peak years as a poet were behind
                  him by 1813, the family’s first two decades at Rydal Mount saw Dorothy reach new heights
                  both in her literary creativity and output. There she composed most of her poems and
                  reworked for potential publication journals she kept on the Continent in 1820 and
                  in Scotland in 1822. At Rydal she also returned to keeping a daily journal, ultimately
                  filling 15 notebooks, known collectively as the <em>Rydal Journals</em>, between 1824 and 1835. Two of these notebooks, the first and last, appear in their
                  entirety for the first time in this edition.</p>
               <p>Into her late fifties, Dorothy remained remarkably vigorous both in mind and body,
                  frequently remarking that she felt even more energetic than in her twenties. But,
                  as chronicled in the latter half of the <em>Rydal Journals</em>, her health gradually but irreparably declined after she became severely ill in early
                  1829. By the end of 1835 chronic pain, a lack of stamina, and intermittent dementia
                  effectively ended her writing career, and she would spend her final two decades confined
                  to the house and grounds of Rydal Mount. After her passing on 25 January 1855, she
                  was buried in the Grasmere churchyard alongside her brother William and numerous beloved
                  friends and family members.</p>

                  <p>Considering that in his later years William was widely seen as England’s greatest
                     living bard and that he would eventually replace Byron as the face of British Romanticism,
                     it was perhaps inevitable that his sister’s life and works would first be valued primarily
                     for whatever insights they afforded into his writings. And, while just how willingly
                     Dorothy played the handmaiden to William’s genius remains hotly contested, her letters
                     and journals suggest she would have had few qualms about going down in literary history
                     as her brother’s unwavering assistant and occasional collaborator.

                              in two recent biographies. In Frances Wilson’s The Ballad of Dorothy Wordsworth (2008),
                              DW is cast as the victim of unrelenting emotional abuse at WW’s hands, which ultimately
                              led to her early-onset dementia. More persuasively, Lucy Newlyn presents their relationship
                              as undeniably collaborative and companionate, as reflected in her titling her 2013
                              joint biography William and Dorothy Wordsworth: “All in Each Other.”</span></div>
                     </div> Moreover, it is abundantly clear from the trove of unpublished journals, travelogues,
                     stories, poems, and commonplace books she left behind that she wrote primarily for

                     Her longtime friend Thomas De Quincey, for one, attested to both her distinctive genius
                     and bona fides as public author when he maintained in 1839, “Miss Wordsworth would
                     have merited a separate notice in any biographical dictionary of our times, had there

                     on the people and places of the English Lakes.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The initial spark for this project can be traced to an earlier Romantic Circles collaboration,
                  the scholarly edition of William Wordsworth’s <em><a class="link_ref" href="/editions/guide_lakes">Guide to the Lakes</a></em>  that Nicholas Mason and Paul Westover, in collaboration with students and colleagues
                  at Brigham Young University (BYU), published in 2015 and revised and expanded in 2020.
                  While investigating the textual history of the five distinct editions of William’s
                  <em>Guide</em>, we were routinely struck by his sister’s crucial, if largely unacknowledged, contributions.
                  This led us to ponder what a “Guide to the Lakes” written entirely by Dorothy might
                  look like, a question we soon took up with Michelle Levy of Simon Fraser University
                  (SFU), a fellow Romanticist who had worked extensively with Dorothy’s manuscripts
                  in researching her articles and books on women’s writing, manuscript culture, and
                  family authorship.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>As we three began seriously considering how we might reverse engineer such a “guidebook”
                     from Dorothy’s writings on the Lakes, we turned to Jeff Cowton, the longtime curator
                     at the Wordsworth Trust, and several BYU and SFU students who had worked with the
                     Wordsworths’ manuscripts while interning or studying in Grasmere. The result has been
                     a collaborative process of over seven years, in which the three lead editors have
                     worked with the Wordsworth Trust and student researchers to study, transcribe, and
                     contextualize Dorothy’s works. Although, in their final forms, the critical apparatus
                     and texts to follow were primarily authored or edited by an experienced scholar—with
                     Michelle Levy leading out on the Grasmere Journal excerpts, the Greens narrative,
                     and the poems; Paul Westover on the Ullswater and Scafell Pike excursions; and Nicholas
                     Mason on the <em>Rydal Journals</em>—every part of this edition has been deeply collaborative.

                  <p>In the early stages of this project, we informally called it 
                     “Dorothy Wordsworth’s Guide to the Lakes.”
                      But, not wanting to confuse readers or perpetuate the image of Dorothy invariably
                     following in her older brother’s footsteps, we eventually settled on the less allusive 
                     “Dorothy Wordsworth’s Lake District.”
                      Whatever its liabilities, however, our working title still encapsulates our vision
                     of gathering and showcasing Dorothy’s vivid portraits of this famously picturesque
                     region, which ultimately became Lake District National Park (1951) and a UNESCO World
                     Heritage Site (2017). Strictly speaking, apart from the substantial sections she supplied
                     for William’s <em>Guide</em>, Dorothy never composed guidebook material as such.

                     </div> In fact, in an amusing 1803 letter to her friend Catherine Clarkson, she ranted, “I
                     think journals of Tours except as far as one is interested in the travellers are very
                     uninteresting. Wretched, wretched writing!”

                     </div> It’s all the more ironic, then, that travel writing—along with the notes, letters,
                     and diary entries inspired by walks closer to home—would become central to her creative
                     output and legacy. Works based on her experiences as a traveler or short-term resident
                     include her journals from Alfoxden and Germany (both 1798), her <em>Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland</em> (1803–1806), her <em>Journal of a Tour on the Continent</em> (1820), her second tour of Scotland (1822), and large segments of the <em>Rydal Journals</em> written on the road. While these texts encompass various literary traditions—nature
                     diary, weather journal, travelogue, commonplace book, and so forth—they cohere as
                     records of things observed and felt by a writer who, left to her own devices, would
                     often walk over a dozen miles a day. Even when at home in Cumbria and drawing on daily
                     experience, Dorothy might say, as Thoreau would years later, that she had “traveled
                     a good deal” in the Lake District.</p>

                     to the Lakes. Eric Sutherland Robertson, for instance, asked in his 1911 book <em>Wordsworthshire</em>, “Who wrote the noblest Guide to the Lakes—William or Dorothy? Let the reader study
                     every page of the [Grasmere] Journal and of the other work before attempting to decide.”

                     are set in or focused upon areas outside the Lakes (for instance, her tours of Scotland
                     and the Continent and several sections of her <em>Rydal Journals</em>). Even then, however, there were more than enough texts to choose from for an edition
                     of this scope, which forced us to leave several brilliant descriptions of the region
                     on the cutting-room floor. Dorothy’s letters alone, for instance, with their recurring
                     effusions on the joys of rambling throughout Westmorland fells and dales, could easily
                     supply enough content for a substantial anthology of Lakeland writing.

                  portrait of Westmorland life at the moment when the Wordsworths returned to the area

               <p>Though Dorothy was self-effacing about her poetic abilities, verse became an important
                  genre for her, especially in later years. This is evidenced by what the Wordsworth
                  Trust labels her Commonplace Book (DCMS 120), which, along with miscellaneous extracts
                  and quotations, includes copies of most of her known poems. Many of these poems, moreover,
                  appear in multiple versions, thereby displaying how serious she was about reworking
                  and recopying her work. Besides offering a diplomatic transcription of all of the
                  verse in DCMS 120, whether complete poems or fragments, this section also includes
                  an introductory essay on what we can learn from Dorothy’s poetry manuscripts and multiple

               <p>Despite the renown of Dorothy’s earlier journals, most of the 15 notebooks recording
                  her daily life between 1824 and 1835 remain unpublished. This edition’s annotated
                  texts of the first and last volumes of her <em>Rydal Journals</em> therefore represent a watershed of sorts in offering a wealth of new perspectives
                  on Dorothy’s daily life in late middle age. Both notebooks included here reflect an
                  abiding affinity for the scenery and inhabitants of the Lakes; but, whereas Notebook
                  1 captures a period marked by boundless energy, Notebook 15 finds her confined to
                  a sickbed, reminiscing over past excursions and taking in whatever sights and sounds

               Clarkson, who, after rereading “heaps” of them in 1833, gushed, “What a heart and
               what a head they discover!” and contemplated all the celebrated authors “whose thinkings
               and feelings are not to be compared with hers!” (Letter to Henry Crabb Robinson, in
               Robinson, <em>Diary, Reminiscences, and Correspondence</em>, 3:35).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
