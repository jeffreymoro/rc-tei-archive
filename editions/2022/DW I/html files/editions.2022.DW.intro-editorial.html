               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In 1995, when “electronic edition” still had a futuristic ring and even the most inclusive
                     of syllabi were constrained by which noncanonical texts were readily available in
                     print, Marilyn Butler issued a call for scholars and publishers to prioritize producing
                     high-quality yet affordable editions of important works by women. “We must have true
                     scholarly editions of a significant body of women’s writing,” she argued, “not only
                     to grasp the internal dynamics of an individual career, but to understand its group
                     dynamics, its inter-relations with society and history.” Merely reprinting an old
                     poem, play, or novel wasn’t enough, as “we mustn’t underrate how much a good edition
                     adds to a ‘raw’ text—far more, indeed, if it’s discreetly presented than most readers
                     retain much consciousness of.” Even a rudimentary critical apparatus, Butler suggested,
                     tends to make us take a text more seriously, as there is an inherent aura to a work
                     that comes shrouded in a “penumbra of knowledge, biographical, textual, intertextual
                     and extra-textual.”

                  </p>
               </div>
               <p>Around the time of Butler’s appeal, many important new editions of Romantic women’s
                  writing did, in fact, appear in print. Since then digital publication has emerged
                  as a key avenue for publishing women’s writing of the period, with the web offering
                  key advantages over print for representing full-color, high-quality images of manuscripts
                  and also for rendering diplomatic transcriptions. In the present instance, publishing
                  on Romantic Circles offers a stable, open-access, and peer-reviewed platform that
                  adheres to the editorial standards of the best print series while also facilitating
                  web-specific features like hypertext links and high-resolution galleries of illustrations
                  and manuscript pages. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Whether publishing in print or online, editors of Romantic-era women writers face
                     particular challenges. Researchers studying most women writers lack the trove of archived
                     manuscripts, letters, and notebooks that have been used to make modern editions of
                     male Romantic writers the gold standard for exhaustively researched, copiously annotated,
                     theoretically informed, and editorially inventive critical texts. Thus, while the
                     trailblazing textual scholarship of Romanticists like Neil Fraistat, Jerome McGann,
                     Donald Reiman, Charles Robinson, and Jack Stillinger has reinvigorated the field of
                     scholarly editing, their weighty volumes have sometimes left editors of the period’s
                     women writers uncertain how to follow suit. 
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div> As Daniel Robinson has observed in relation to his own edition of the writing of Mary
                     Robinson, “the relationship of the previously neglected woman writer to the canon
                     may be forever tenuous due to the nature of the archive, and this determines the work
                     an editor can do. The quality of an edition, therefore, is contingent upon, in effect,
                     the quality of the archive.” 
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div> For many women of the period, the archive consists mainly or exclusively of print
                     editions. Therefore, with a few notable exceptions, those producing editions of women
                     Romantic writers lack primary resources. This is true even for those working on writers
                     like the prolific Ann Radcliffe or ultra-canonical Jane Austen, for whom we have only
                     one manuscript fragment from her six printed novels.</p>

               <p>With Dorothy Wordsworth, however, the opposite is true. She is a writer who published
                  little in her lifetime, especially under her own name, but who left behind a wealth
                  of manuscripts. Several of her works survive in multiple manuscript versions, almost
                  all of which are conveniently archived at the Wordsworth Trust and, since 2012, available
                  digitally through Adam Matthew’s <em>Romanticism: Life, Literature, and Landscape</em> database. Moreover, unlike most of her female contemporaries’, Dorothy’s writing
                  has, since the Victorian age, been admired, edited, and even re-edited by a series
                  of leading scholars.</p>
               <p>Four years before Dorothy’s death, excerpts from her <em>Grasmere Journals</em> first appeared under her name in <em>Memoirs of William Wordsworth</em>, the biography her nephew Christopher Wordsworth Jr. published in the wake of the
                  poet’s death. Twenty-three years later, Principal J. C. Shairp’s 1874 edition of her
                  <em>Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland A.D. 1803</em> proved so popular that it went into a third edition within a year. Then, in 1889,
                  the preeminent Wordsworthian of late-Victorian England, William Knight, published
                  the most extensive selections from Dorothy’s Alfoxden, Hamburg, and Grasmere journals
                  to date in his eleven-volume <em>Life of William Wordsworth</em> (1889). Knight soon republished these excerpts, along with several more from her
                  travel narratives and “mountain rambles,” in his landmark two-volume <em>Journals of Dorothy Wordsworth</em> (1897). This was the standard Dorothy Wordsworth edition until 1941, when Ernest
                  de Sélincourt, the great Wordsworth editor of the early twentieth century, released
                  his own two-volume edition of her journals. (De Sélincourt, like Knight before him,
                  began by working on William’s writings but soon became one of Dorothy’s champions.)
                  Although only minimally contextualized and annotated, and devoid of any detailed analysis
                  of conflicting versions and other textual concerns, De Sélincourt’s <em>Journals of Dorothy Wordsworth</em> remains in many respects the closest thing to a proper scholarly edition of Dorothy’s
                  prose works.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Another breakthrough moment for the study of Dorothy Wordsworth, and arguably for
                     Romantic women writers more broadly, came in 1974, when the Romanticism section in
                     the third edition of the <em>Norton Anthology of English Literature</em>, edited by M. H. Abrams, admitted her into what had previously been an all-male club.
                     Yet, even while introducing excerpts from the <em>Grasmere Journals</em>, the anthology signaled that Dorothy’s inclusion had less to do with the intrinsic
                     merits of her writing than with the light they shed on the domestic and writing life
                     of her famous poet-brother.

                              (4)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>This enduring sense of DW’s writings being more useful as secondary than primary sources
                              partly explains the early, persistent, and, at times, exclusive focus on those passages
                              from her Grasmere Journals that capture peak moments in WW’s and Coleridge’s poetic
                              careers.</span></div>
                     </div> Of course, the <em>Norton Anthology</em> was hardly the first to treat her journals as, above all, a study aid for the masterpieces
                     composed by men of the “Wordsworth circle.” Knight, for instance, notoriously justified
                     abridging her journals by explaining that they “contain numerous trivial details”
                     and contending, “there is no need to record all the cases in which the sister wrote,
                     ‘Today I mended William’s shirts,’ or ‘William gathered sticks,’ or ‘I went in search
                     of eggs,’ etc. etc.” He preferred passages that would cast “a flood of light on the
                     circumstances under which her brother’s poems were composed.” 
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">
                              (5)

                     </div> And while De Sélincourt was well ahead of his time when he declared that “Dorothy
                     Wordsworth is probably the most remarkable and the most distinguished of English writers
                     who never wrote a line for the general public,” 
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">
                              (6)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>DWJ, 1:v.</span></div>
                     </div> the critical apparatus to his edition of her journals perpetuated the tradition of
                     placing heaviest emphasis on moments when her writings might illuminate William’s
                     life and works. Furthermore, his claim that Dorothy never wrote for the public demands
                     some scrutiny, for although she rarely wrote with publication directly in view, she
                     knew that much of what she wrote would be absorbed by William and published by him.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>With the late twentieth-century feminist turn in literary studies, however, scholars
                     began to be newly attuned to Dorothy’s distinctive gifts, and to the audience that
                     her writing garnered, even in her lifetime. Susan Levin’s <em>Dorothy Wordsworth and Romanticism</em> (1987) was a breakthrough moment in this respect, as it at once made a persuasive
                     case for revaluing Dorothy’s life and work and, in its latter half, offered the first
                     anthology of her poems. Likewise, successive Oxford World’s Classics versions of <em>The Grasmere and Alfoxden Journals</em>, beginning with Helen Darbishire’s pocket-sized edition of 1958 and culminating in
                     Pamela Woof’s masterful edition of 2001, treated Dorothy’s diaries as “classics” worthy
                     of meticulous presentation and generous annotation. When the 2001 edition appeared,
                     Nicola Trott rightfully celebrated how Woof “establishes the full independence of
                     Dorothy Wordsworth as a writer” and “makes it abundantly clear that Dorothy’s writing
                     was not merely fodder for his [William’s] own, nor indeed was it about him, except
                     in so far as he entered a narrative already crowded with incident and observation.”

               <p>As in Woof’s edition, Dorothy is the undisputed protagonist of this Romantic Circles
                  electronic edition of her writings on the Lake District. To a degree matched only
                  by Levin’s 2009 Longman Cultural Edition, our <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.contents.html">table of contents</a> strays from the beaten path in including a range of lesser-known and even previously
                  unpublished works demonstrating her abilities in multiple genres and stages of life.
                  Moreover, excepting Woof, no previous editors have contextualized and annotated Dorothy’s
                  works as thoroughly as we have here, and we pay unprecedented attention to the material
                  forms of her texts and what they can teach us about the nature of her writing process,
                  literary sociability, and intended audiences.</p>
               <p>At a moment of belt-tightening in academic publishing in the humanities, a scholarly
                  edition with this level of breadth and detail is increasingly imaginable only in the
                  digital realm, where editors face fewer constraints in matters of length, layout,
                  and illustration. Since the earliest online editions appeared in the mid-1990s, the
                  best examples of the genre have appreciated and capitalized on the distinctive advantages
                  of this new medium. As a case in point, the digital version of Charles Robinson’s
                  <a class="link_ref" href="http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/contents/frankenstein/"><em>Frankenstein</em> Notebooks</a> published two decades ago in the Shelley-Godwin Archive remains an essential resource.
                  On a platform available to anyone with an internet connection, it offers high-resolution
                  images of Mary Shelley’s manuscripts and scrupulous transcriptions, which combine
                  to present the material contexts of this novel’s production and circulation in an
                  entirely new light. Similarly, the <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.edickinson.org/">Emily Dickinson Archive</a> deploys digital tools to re-present a manuscript writer whose poetry has consistently
                  been distorted by print mediations.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Following in the footsteps of leading digital editors, we have designed this edition
                     to showcase the challenges of rendering Dorothy’s manuscripts into typographic characters.
                     Thanks to the Wordsworth Trust’s generosity, we provide dozens of scans of the original
                     manuscripts, providing many opportunities to compare them to our transcriptions. As
                     the digitized pages from her notebooks make readily apparent, Dorothy often wrote
                     to the moment, particularly when journaling, and did not always come back to revise
                     or create fair copies. When necessary, she wrote in a neat, legible hand; otherwise,
                     as readers of her letters know, she usually preferred to apologize for her “bad habit
                     of scrawling” rather than labor over every word.

                     </div> Consequently, merely transcribing some of her more private texts, like her <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-1-intro.html">Rydal Journals</a>, presents countless editorial dilemmas.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Dorothy’s poems pose different challenges, as many survive in multiple drafts that
                  are rife with variants. Since she published only a handful of these poems and did
                  not regularly identify or collect final versions, no one manuscript can be said to
                  have authority over another. Still other texts, like <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.Greens-intro.html">“A Narrative Concerning George &amp; Sarah Green”</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.Ulls-intro.html">“Excursion on the Banks of Ullswater,”</a> survive in multiple copies made for various purposes and audiences, some with substantial
                  corrections and revisions.</p>
               <p>Given such variations, we have been ecumenical in our editorial approach. As detailed
                  in our introductions to specific sections, we have tried to tailor our digital presentation
                  and editorial methodology to the distinctive features of individual texts and manuscripts.
                  For instance, recognizing the challenges of engaging with the fragmentary and allusive
                  <em>Rydal Journals</em> without a familiarity with Dorothy’s world ca. 1825–1835, we supplement our transcriptions
                  with detailed contextual introductions, indexes of key people and places, and hundreds
                  of hyperlinked endnotes. In contrast, with Woof and others having already thoroughly
                  annotated the <em>Grasmere Journals</em>, we instead opt to provide a diplomatic transcription of the first of the four notebooks,
                  emphasizing Dorothy’s revisions and the manuscript’s physical characteristics. And
                  for her Lakeland “excursions,” we include interactive maps and dozens of illustrations
                  to create a stronger sense of geography and material circumstances. In sum, we trust
                  that editorial flexibility reflects Dorothy Wordsworth’s own flexibility and variety
                  as a writer.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Just as we have tried to adopt best practices from earlier digital editions, we have
                     followed the lead of pioneering editors of women’s writing in questioning the conventional
                     belief that, as W. W. Greg put it in 1954, the editor’s task is “to present the text,
                     so far as the available evidence permits, in the form in which we may suppose that
                     it would have stood in a fair copy, made by the author himself, of the work as he
                     finally intended it.”

                     </div> Authorial intention is a notoriously vexed subject in critical theory—“final intention”
                     perhaps even more so, not least because it depends on the often shaky assumption that
                     “final” versions exist. Further, as McGann has argued, this traditional focus on final
                     intentions rests upon notions of “the autonomy of the isolated author,” an arguably
                     masculine construction that “has the effect of desocializing our historical view of
                     the literary work.”

                     </div> And Dorothy is an exemplary social writer, frequently customizing her texts for different
                     readers and occasions and often writing in close collaboration with others. She frequently
                     customized her texts for different readers and occasions. She also tended to leave
                     multiple versions of texts side by side in her notebooks, making it all but impossible
                     in many cases to determine her “final intentions.” The same facts make it impossible
                     to adopt the tenets of an opposing philosophy of textual editing—one perhaps most
                     famously embraced by the Cornell Wordsworth editors—that consistently privileges the
                     earliest completed version. Even where the sequence of versions can be reconstructed
                     in Dorothy’s notebooks—and usually it cannot—it is impossible to say that one version
                     is better, more authoritative, or more important than another.</p>

                  <p>Fortunately, the nature of this digital edition allows us in several cases to offer
                     multiple versions of a text, leaving readers to interpret each on its own terms. In
                     such instances, we apply principles from the modern “versioning” school of textual
                     editing, which has perhaps been most effectively modeled by editors such as Mays and
                     Stillinger, who have taken pains to reproduce multiple versions of poems by Coleridge
                     and Keats. As Amy Culley and Anna F. Fitzer have suggested, this approach treats writing
                     “as a collaborative and social product” and discerning authorial intent as “just one
                     in a sequence of textual negotiations.”

                     as described by Ann Hollinshead Hurley and Chanita Goodblatt, “focuses on the material
                     properties of the manuscript or book, its print or performance history, and records
                     of its dissemination.”

               <p>While our editorial approach may vary from text to text, all sections of this edition
                  adhere to the following practices: </p>
               <ul class="unordered">
                  <li class="item" id="d30e398"><span style="font-weight:bold">References to the author</span>: We default to the somewhat familiar “Dorothy” as an imperfect alternative to the
                     potentially confusing “Wordsworth” (which still tends to connote the brother) or the
                     clumsy repetition of both writers’ first and last names. Likewise, where William Wordsworth
                     appears in our apparatus, he becomes “William.” For the sake of brevity, our endnotes
                     use initials for Dorothy (DW), William (WW), and Mary Wordsworth (MW), Sara Hutchinson
                     (SH), and Samuel Taylor Coleridge (STC). Endnotes reference William and Mary’s three
                     surviving children (John, Dora, and Willy) by first names only (see the list of <span class="ref">Abbreviations of Commonly Used Names</span>).</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d30e405"><span style="font-weight:bold">References to the region</span>: To avoid overusing any one toponym, we use “the Lakes,” “the Lake District,” “Lakeland,”
                     and “Cumbria” interchangeably. In doing so, we are cognizant that the Wordsworths
                     would have considered themselves residents of “the Lakes” and Westmorland but perhaps
                     not of “the Lake District” (which, first gaining traction in the 1820s, would have
                     seemed a neologism) or “Cumbria” (which had grown archaic). These latter labels became
                     normative only in the latter half of the twentieth century, after the formations of
                     the “Lake District National Park” in 1951 and County of Cumbria (encompassing the
                     traditional counties of Westmoreland and Cumberland and slivers of Lancashire and
                     Yorkshire) in 1974.

                              from its 1835 edition forward had “District of the Lakes” in its title.</span></div>

                  <li class="item" id="d30e415"><span style="font-weight:bold">Spelling and punctuation</span>: All transcriptions strive to replicate Dorothy’s spelling and punctuation precisely.
                     When unconventional, inaccurate, or omitted punctuation in the manuscript might produce
                     confusion, we provide punctuation marks inside editorial brackets (e.g., [,]). While
                     our reading texts preserve Dorothy’s variant or archaic renderings of place names
                     (e.g., “Ulswater” and “Scawfell”), our editorial apparatus generally privileges modern
                     spellings (e.g., “Ullswater” and “Scafell”).</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d30e419"><span style="font-weight:bold">Citations</span>: As per general Romantic Circles guidelines, all citations follow the short-form
                     rules dictated in the <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em> (17th edition). See also our list of <span class="ref">Abbreviations for Commonly Used Sources.</span></li>
                  <li class="item" id="d30e429"><span style="font-weight:bold">Titles</span>: When Dorothy provided a title for a text, we reproduce it. In many cases, however,
                     she saw no need for titles. For her unnamed poems, we have resisted the urge to offer
                     standardized titles, adopting instead the first line and placing it within brackets.
                     For her journals, also untitled, for ease of reference we use names commonly used
                     by scholars—that is, <em>Grasmere Journals</em> and <em>Rydal Journals</em>. This practice adheres to the norm of formatting references to posthumously constructed
                     texts (e.g., <em>The Prelude</em> of 1805) identically to those for lifetime editions (e.g., <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> of 1798). But when referring to the physical manuscripts or to specific journal entries
                     we use the term “Grasmere journal notebooks” in acknowledgement of the fact that DW
                     never appears to have considered the four notebooks now known as the <em>Grasmere Journals</em> a unified work. The fact that many teaching editions extract her Grasmere entries
                     from notebooks that also contain other materials reminds us that “journals” are not
                     necessarily identical with the manuscripts in which they are found. Especially when
                     referencing these early journals, then, we attempt to distinguish between the text
                     and its material instantiation on paper.</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d30e448">For Dorothy’s two “excursion” narratives, we adopt titles supplied for them in William’s
                     <em>Guide to the Lakes</em> and retained by later editors, as these serviceably describe their contents.</li>
