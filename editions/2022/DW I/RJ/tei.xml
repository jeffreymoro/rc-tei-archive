                        for her newborn daughter, Dinah (or Diana, 1825&#8211;93). Betty and her stonemason husband, Edward
                        Dixon (1789&#8211;1830), lived on the edge of Grasmere in Easedale, and she may have known DW from
                        having once worked at RM. Parish and census records show Diana growing up to work as a housemaid in
                        Loughrigg before marrying Frank Garnett of Grasmere in 1852.</note>

                        driving stodgy “poetic diction” out of fashion (319) and having conveyed “a

                        ([Taylor], “Wordsworth’s <hi rend="italic">Poetical Works</hi>,” 319, 338).

                        with the Hoares, see WLMS 1 / 9 / 3 and 1 / 11 / 7). The eldest son, John,
                        had just returned from a long trip in Florence, where he pursued his
                        classical interests while trying to restore his fragile health. The middle
                        son, Charles, had also spent much of 1833–34 on the Continent, and, while
                        touring the Louvre, he had fallen in “Love at First Sight” with Charlotte
                        Day, a clergyman’s daughter from Suffolk whom he would marry in December

                        months between entries, SH had unexpectedly passed away on 23 June, Dora’s
                        condition had gradually improved, and DW had often struggled with acute
                        physical pain and memory loss (<hi rend="italic">Letters</hi>, 6:78, 83,
                        89). In a 26 September letter to his and DW’s brother Christopher, WW
                        reported that “Our dear Sister is in bodily health undoubtedly much better”
                        but “her mind received a shock upon the death of Miss Hutchinson from which
                        is has never recovered.” More specifically, he noted that “her memory of
                        passing events has greatly failed, and her judgements also in all that
                        respects her disease, though not at all in other things. Indeed I think upon
                        points of morals, character, literature, etc., she expresses herself as well
                        or better than ever she did” (<hi rend="italic">Letters</hi>, 6:96). Writing
                        to Robert Southey two days later, however, he was less upbeat, fearing that
                        her faltering memory and “impaired judgement” were side-effects of “the
                        great quantity of opium which it has been thought proper to give her” (<hi

                        and often in an unusually unsteady hand, DW used several pages in the back
                        of Notebook 15 to revise portions of “Lines to Dora H.,” a new poem for
                        Dorothy Harrison (1825–73), the eldest daughter of her <hi
                            rend="color(ED7D31)">“Cousin Dorothy” Harrison</hi> of Ambleside.
                        Levin’s Longman edition includes a full version of this poem that is based
                        on a fair copy that Elizabeth (“Ebba”) Hutchinson made in DW’s commonplace
                        book (DCMS 120) in June 1835 (Levin, 215–17). Levin tentatively identifies
                        the poem’s recipient as a daughter of George Hutchinson, MW’s youngest
                        brother, but this is confuted by the fact that his Dora was not born until
                        late 1835 (or several months after Ebba’s dated transcription of this poem)
                        and survived for less than six months. Elsewhere in the Longman edition,
                        Levin misidentifies DW’s initial pages of revisions to this poem in Notebook
                        15 as “a final [journal] entry of disconnected words scrawled irregularly on
                        the page” (175).</p></note>
