                     literary reputation and greater freedom to travel from home as his children came of
                     age and the household had more disposable income. Besides frequent periods when intense
                     eye pain rendered him unable to read or write, he was otherwise, by DW’s report, “well
                     but much thinner than he used to be, and this makes him look old.”

                  family and friends outside the Lake District. Such trips were largely possible because
                  of DW’s willingness to stay at Rydal Mount supervising the household staff and any

                     and “his limbs are knitting together – they do not look so large and clumsy as last
                     year.” More flatteringly, she added, “He has a manly generous mind – gentle disposition

                     at 42, Dora was generally lively and energetic in the mid-1820s. She spent part of
                     1823 living in Ambleside as a temporary teacher at the Dowlings’ school for girls
                     and, after returning home, functioned increasingly as her father’s scribe and traveling
                     companion. Her distant cousin Tom Robinson’s brief, and ill-fated, attempt to woo
                     her in the autumn of 1825 is obliquely chronicled in Notebook 1.</p>

                     generally opted to school him at home rather than expose him to germ-infested dormitories.
                     In late 1823 DW reported that “Willy continues stout and well, and improves as much
                     in scholarship as can be expected . . . of one so lively and volatile as he is.”

                  and Wales. At the outset of Notebook 1, she was with her dying cousin, Thomas Monkhouse,

               such a thing was never before heard, being not needed” (<em>Letters</em>, 2:232). Almost exactly a year later, she described Mr. North as “a Man hated by
               all his Neighbours” (2:339). And on 6 April 1813, she recounted being briefly “vexed
               with [herself] for having spoken so ill-naturedly of the Norths” until their dilatory
               departure from Rydal Mount quashed any urge to “repent [her] of [her] malice” (3:89–90).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note49_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               for the Wordsworths at Dove Cottage in 1806–1807 and at Rydal Mount in 1814, with
               stints in the households of the De Quinceys and Lloyds (of Old Brathay). Another Dawson,
               Jane, worked briefly for the family in 1820, as evidenced by SH’s acidic contrast
               between the “daftness” of Jane Dawson and the “more decorous” ways of “Old Mary” Dawson
               (<em>LSH</em>, 201). The spelling of Ann’s name (which DW generally renders “Anne”) and her age
               come from the census record for the inhabitants of Rydal Mount in 1841.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note64_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
