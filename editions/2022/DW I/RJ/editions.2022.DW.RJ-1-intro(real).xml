                brother, with whom she had shared a home since 1795. In his mid-fifties, WW’s
                literary reputation and audience were still steadily expanding, and he continued to
                write new poems and rework old ones, including the revisions to 
                <title level="m">The Excursion</title> chronicled in Notebook 1.

                        </note> 
                Although chronic eye pain often made it
                difficult for him to read and DW remarked in 1825 that he was “much thinner than he
                used to be, and this makes him look old,” the poet generally remained as hale and
                hearty as his sister.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors"><title level="m">Letters</title></note>, 4:332.</note> 
                Beyond his literary
                commitments, WW devoted considerable energy during this period to his duties as
                Distributor of Stamps for Westmorland and his extensive engagement with local and
                national politics.

                age 55):</hi> WW’s wife,
                who before meeting her husband had been DW’s friend when they were teenagers in
                Penrith. Like the other adults in her household, MW was increasingly prone to
                wanderlust as her children came of age, and for much of the 1820s she, DW, and SH
                essentially alternated being on duty at RM while the others traveled. With it being
                DW’s turn to stay at home in 1825, MW spent most of that summer and fall with
                friends and family at Kents Bank on the Cartmel Peninsula, Harrogate spa in
                Yorkshire, and Coleorton Hall in Leicestershire. Accordingly, she appears less
                frequently in Notebook 1 than in many subsequent sections of the

                struggles with mathematics, a subject emphasized more heavily there than at other
                universities. Accordingly, in 1823, WW used family connections to secure his son’s
                admission to New College, Oxford.

                While John was still
                enrolled, his parents kept him at home for much of 1825 owing to a reported typhus
                outbreak at Oxford. This left him largely carefree, and DW’s journal suggests he
                spent much of his time both with old friends and with Fanny Barlow, a pretty young
                heiress who arrived in the area in early 1825.

                After spending part of 1823–24
                working in Ambleside as a teacher at the Dowlings’ school, Dora moved back to RM,
                where, when healthy, she helped her mother and aunts with household chores and her
                father compose letters and copy poems. For much of the decade covered by the 
                <title level="m">RJ</title>, her chronic illnesses dominated the family’s domestic
                routines and travel schedules. In the summer of 1825, for instance, the Wordsworths
                spent two months at a rental home at Kents Bank on Morecambe Bay largely for her
                health. In the short term, the rest and sea air appear to have helped, as during
                this vacation a revitalized Dora formed the most intense attachment of her young
                life with the family’s new friend Jane Jewsbury.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors"> The depth and immediacy of Dora’s attachment to

                        frank, exuberant, and, ardent correspondence in the months that

                caught the eye of Lt. Tom Robinson, a distant cousin spending his shore leave at his
                brother’s home in Ambleside. In general, DW remained characteristically discrete
                about this budding relationship, but, if there is any prevailing theme to the final
                segment of Notebook 1, it is how inseparable Dora and Tom became throughout the fall
                of 1825.

                being largely educated at home rather than exposed to contagion at a boarding
                school. In late 1823 DW reported that her then-13-year-old nephew “continues stout

                Oxford, in 1818, Hartley secured a prestigious fellowship at Oriel College, only to
                be promptly expelled for insolence and insobriety. After two unfruitful years of
                trying to support himself writing for London periodicals, he grew resigned to “not
                expecting much happiness” in life and, heeding his father’s advice, accepted a
                teaching job at his old school in Ambleside.

                however, their fortunes abruptly turned, when he was court-martialed for having
                knowingly sold the army horses that were unfit for action, found guilty, and
                stripped of his rank and commission.

                Where the Elliotts took refuge in the wake of this calamity is
                unclear, but there is no indication that any reputational stain followed them north
                in the 1820s. If anything, their new neighbors initially feared this fashionable and
                childless couple would find Westmorland life decidedly provincial, with their
                housekeeper at Ivy Cottage fretting that she would “have some trouble with the new
                Tenants” and MW spreading advance reports that Mrs. Elliott was “a fine 
                <emph>stately woman</emph>” who “expected to find in the Cottage the
                accommodations of a stately Mansion.”

                Such anxieties were soon
                dispelled, however, by the new arrivals’ generosity and conviviality, and the
                Wordsworths quickly came to rely on both their company and newspaper subscriptions.
                Just days before the start of Notebook 1, the Elliotts vacated Ivy Cottage and took
                temporary accommodations in Ambleside. Thereafter they spent much of 1825 in
                Devonshire with friends before returning to the area that autumn.

                fellow “Lake Poet” (and, since 1812, the nation’s poet laureate) and the daughter of
                a Bristol milliner he had married in 1795, shortly after his fellow “pantisocrat”
                Samuel Taylor Coleridge had married Edith’s older sister Sarah. Since 1803 the
                Southeys and Coleridges had lived together at Greta Hall in Keswick, with the former
                helping to compensate for the financial and emotional support that was increasingly
                unforthcoming from Mrs. Coleridge’s husband. Despite being routinely linked together
                in the public mind, Southey and WW were more rivals than friends for the first
                decade of their acquaintance, especially after Southey published a withering review
                of <hi rend="italic">Lyrical Ballads</hi> in 1798. DW initially shared her brother’s
                disdain, believing Southey showed “nothing of the dignity or enthusiasm of the
                Poet’s Character”; but her opinion was irrevocably changed in 1805 by his
                compassionate response to her brother John’s tragic death, as he “was so tender and
                kind that I loved him all at once – he wept with us in our sorrow, and for that
                cause I think I must always love him.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn88" n="87"><p

                “we liked Mr Tillbrook very much for his unaffected manners,” but, presumably
                alluding to his laboring-class roots, she also noted “a coarseness, a want of polish
                about him which might be smoothed away with advantage.”<note place="foot"

                for much of the year, he typically leased it out, and over time several of his
                tenants—including the Quillinans, Gees, and Elliotts—became intimates of the
                Wordsworths. While Tillbrook himself developed a cordial relationship with his
                neighbors, he never became as close to WW as he was to Robert Southey.<note

                The late bishop had been a towering figure on the national stage, earning separate

                father’s. After her husband’s passing in 1816, Mrs. Watson remained at Calgarth with

                        the eldest, Dorothy, provided fodder for local gossips by carrying on a
                        romantic intrigue with John Christian Curwen, a Windermere grandee who,
                        besides being married and twenty years her senior, was one of her father’s
                        closest friends. Gleefully reporting this “scandalam magnatum” to a friend,
                        Southey noted that Curwen “confesses to impudence but vows &amp; protests
                        innocence as to any thing farther,” before spitefully adding that Miss
                        Watson’s “beauty affords about as much excuse as his youth &amp;
                        inexperience” (<ref

                interacted during the bishop’s lifetime, they became increasingly friendly
                thereafter, partly as a reflecting of the Wordsworths’ increasing standing both in
                the community and beyond. The <hi rend="italic">RJ</hi> show the families exchanging
                visits a few times each year, and DW noted in a February 1826 letter that “at Rydal

                of Calgarth (the Bishop’s Daughters).”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn96" n="95"><p
