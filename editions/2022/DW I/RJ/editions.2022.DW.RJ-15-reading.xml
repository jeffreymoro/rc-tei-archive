                        for her newborn daughter, Dinah (or Diana, 1825&#8211;93). Betty and her stonemason husband, Edward
                        Dixon (1789&#8211;1830), lived on the edge of Grasmere in Easedale, and she may have known DW from
                        having once worked at RM. Parish and census records show Diana growing up to work as a housemaid in
                        Loughrigg before marrying Frank Garnett of Grasmere in 1852.</note>

                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">The influential London publisher John Murray (1778&#8211;1843, <ref target="https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/64907">
                     <title level="m">DNB</title</ref>) had sent the November 1834 number of his <title level="m">Quarterly Review</title>, which included an effusive
                      41-page review of two new editions of WW&#8217;s poems that honored him for driving stodgy &#8220;poetic diction&#8221; out of fashion (319) and having 
                      conveyed &#8220;a deeper sense of the dignity of his calling&#8221; than any previous poet ([Taylor], <title level="a">Wordsworth&#8217; 
                      <title level="m">Poetical Works</hi>,</title> 319, 338). WW had already been informed of this review by its anonymous author, his friend and admirer Henry Taylor.</note>

                      Heath (see note for 6 October; for their earlier stays with the Hoares, see WLMS 1 / 9 / 3 and 1 / 11 / 7). The eldest son, John, had just returned
                      from a long trip in Florence, where he pursued his classical interests while trying to restore his fragile health. The middle son, Charles, had also
                      spent much of 1833&#8211;34 on the Continent, and, while touring the Louvre, he had fallen in &#8220;Love at First Sight&#8221; with Charlotte
                      Day, a clergyman&#8217;s daughter from Suffolk whom he would marry in December 1835 (Charles Wordsworth, <title level="m">Annals</hi>, 158&#8211;60).</note>

                        James Kingsley (1809&#8211;39). Three years on, Fleming was using his family&#8217;s influence to have himself reinstated and his popular 
                        replacement evicted from the rectory attached to the living. This struck many, including the Wordsworths, as an unusually egregious case of

                        condition had gradually improved, and DW had often struggled with acute

                        89). In a 26 September letter to his and DW’s brother Christopher, WW
                        reported that “Our dear Sister is in bodily health undoubtedly much better”
                        but “her mind received a shock upon the death of Miss Hutchinson from which
                        is has never recovered.” More specifically, he noted that “her memory of
                        passing events has greatly failed, and her judgements also in all that
                        respects her disease, though not at all in other things. Indeed I think upon
                        points of morals, character, literature, etc., she expresses herself as well
                        or better than ever she did” (<hi rend="italic">Letters</hi>, 6:96). Writing
                        to Robert Southey two days later, however, he was less upbeat, fearing that
                        her faltering memory and “impaired judgement” were side-effects of “the

                            rend="color(ED7D31)">“Cousin Dorothy” Harrison</hi> of Ambleside.
                        Levin’s Longman edition includes a full version of this poem that is based
                        on a fair copy that Elizabeth (“Ebba”) Hutchinson made in DW’s commonplace
                        book (DCMS 120) in June 1835 (Levin, 215–17). Levin tentatively identifies
                        the poem’s recipient as a daughter of George Hutchinson, MW’s youngest
                        brother, but this is confuted by the fact that his Dora was not born until
                        late 1835 (or several months after Ebba’s dated transcription of this poem)
                        and survived for less than six months. Elsewhere in the Longman edition,
                        Levin misidentifies DW’s initial pages of revisions to this poem in Notebook
                        15 as “a final [journal] entry of disconnected words scrawled irregularly on
                        the page” (175).</p></note>
