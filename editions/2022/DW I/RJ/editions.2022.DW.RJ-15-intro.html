            <h3>(DCMS 118.5, 4 October 1834—19 April 1835, 4 November 1835)</h3>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>When, in October 1834, Dorothy Wordsworth began what would prove the last volume of
                  her <em>Rydal Journals</em> (<span style="font-style:italic">RJ</span>), she already seemed on borrowed time, having repeatedly been on deathwatch since
                  falling seriously ill in April 1829. Her survival was, in part, a testament to the
                  devoted care of her physician, Thomas Carr, and her family, including her brother
                  William, whose daily routine in 1833 included reading to her, massaging her swollen
                  feet, and, weather permitting, wheeling her into the garden (fig. 1).

                  </div> While Dorothy’s condition was no longer critical during the six-month span (October
                  1834–April 1835) at the center of Notebook 15, she remained largely confined to her
                  upstairs bedroom at Rydal Mount.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The prevailing norm for interpreting—or, perhaps more accurately, disregarding—the
                  two decades between the close of the <span style="font-style:italic">RJ</span> in 1835 and Dorothy’s death in 1855 was established by Ernest De Sélincourt in 1933,
                  when he asserted that “the last twenty years of posthumous life . . . only belong
                  to the biography of Dorothy Wordsworth in so far as they reveal in fitful gleams something
                  of what she once had been.” 
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)

                  </div> While subsequent biographers have devoted more space to diagnosing Dorothy’s medical
                  condition—variously speculating that suffered from gallstones, arteriosclerosis, “pre-senile
                  dementia of a type similar to Alzheimer’s disease,” or “depressive pseudo-dementia,
                  a condition in which severe depression mimics the symptoms of dementia.” 
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Newlyn, 275; Gittings, 271, 282–83; Wilson, Ballad of Dorothy Wordsworth, 281.</span></div>
                  </div> —they have largely followed De Sélincourt’s lead in taking the period covered by Notebook
                  15 as a harrowing transition into Dorothy’s “posthumous life.” With growing sensitivity
                  in literary studies toward ageing and disability, however, this pattern might be changing.
                  Polly Atkin’s recent book <span style="font-style:italic">Recovering Dorothy</span> (2021), in particular, offers an overdue corrective to the longstanding impulse to
                  dismiss her final decades. Noting how “Dorothy Wordsworth’s biographers have had a
                  peculiar predilection for killing her long before her death,” Atkin sets out “to shine
                  a light into the darkness and restore the rest of Dorothy’s narrative.” Quite simply,
                  she insists, Dorothy “did not die, emotionally or otherwise, until 1855. She did not
                  vanish. She was not undone. She may have changed, as we all do, in sickness and in
                  health, but she was still Dorothy.” 
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                           (4)

                  </div>
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>Of course, there is no disputing that Dorothy’s health was never again as robust after
               she was stricken with cholera or some other disease in early 1829; and, if read in
               isolation, Notebook 15 might be taken as proof of her gradual physical and mental
               decline. Shaky handwriting, ink spills, crossings-out, and basic errors proliferate
               as the volume draws to a close, and signs of what seems an increasingly circumscribed
               and dreary existence appear at every turn. On the “dull, dark &amp; cold” tenth day of
               February 1835, for instance, Dorothy writes, “My limbs unusually weak. With difficulty
               I went to window &amp; back.” A month later, on 15 March, she laments, “The greatest evil
               attending my present disordered state is that I can read or work little or none.”
               For every simple pleasure, such as her “companion Robin,” the bird who frequents her
               windowsill throughout the autumn of 1834, there seems a counterbalancing threat, like
               the new cat at Rydal Mount that leaves Dorothy in terror about the bird’s safety.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Seemingly further support for a narrative of steady decline comes in Dorothy’s concluding
                  entry of 4 November 1835. Since having last written in her journal on 19 April, she
                  had grown too “dreadfully weak and languid” to write, and her mental health had further
                  plummeted after the shock of Sara Hutchinson’s sudden passing on 23 June. 
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">
                           (5)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Letters, 6:51, 78.</span></div>
                  </div> Yet, resolved to return to her decade-long habit of recording her daily activities,
                  she “[took] up the pen once again.” The pathos of the final entry that follows emanates,
                  in part, from its inaccuracies—she gives the year as 1815 (not 1835) and seems to
                  have been confused about her nephew John’s recent whereabouts—and also from its ending
                  with the double negative “Dora not unwell,” as if asserting that to be “not unwell”
                  is all one might reasonably hope for in this life (see fig. 2). The most heartbreaking
                  aspect of this entry, however, is its isolation on the journal’s last page, as, after
                  having mustered the strength to resume her journal, Dorothy could eke out but a single
                  entry before needing to set it aside for good.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Writing in his own journal two months later, Dorothy’s friend Henry Crabb Robinson
                  would attest to the severity of her physical decline. Two years had passed since Robinson’s
                  last visit to Rydal, and he was obviously rattled to find on 2 January 1836 that,
                  even in what was said to be “her best state,” Dorothy paid little heed to his presence
                  and “went on repeating without intermission fragments of poetry—her brother’s, Cowper’s,
                  Dr. Watts’s—then repeating the Doxology, and the most melancholy act of all, carried
                  away by the association of ideas, repeating the Amen in a loud tone and mocking a
                  clerk accompanied by loud laughter.” 
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> Were one to stop reading there, this might seem unimpeachable proof of her ongoing
                  deterioration; but continuing just a few pages further, we find Robinson rejoicing
                  on 31 January at having found her “much calmer and reasonable.” Dorothy “sang some
                  of her brother’s poems,” he reports, and “she evidently knew me, and was not irrational
                  in anything she said.” 
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">

            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>That this was not merely a momentary rebound is suggested by a remarkably lucid and
                  witty letter that Dorothy sent Christopher Wordsworth Jr. a few weeks after Robinson’s
                  visit. Playfully greeting her 28-year-old nephew as a “public Orator” often summoned
                  “to speak in the presence of Kings, Princes and Bishops,” she explains she is writing
                  because Christopher’s “uncle, the Poet of the Lakes, has been deputed” to speak at
                  the groundbreaking for a new seminary, but “alas! the poet is no Orator and he knows
                  not what to say on this important occasion.” Rushing to her brother’s aid, she merrily
                  entreats her nephew, as “the first Orator of the Nation,” to “make a speech for [William]
                  which I will answer for it he will pronounce verbatim.” Dorothy concludes by announcing
                  her intention “to see you all at Cambridge in summer,” sanguinely reporting, “I have
                  got through a mighty struggle, and thank God am now as well as ever I was in my life
                  except that I have not recovered the use of my legs. My Arms have been active enough
                  as the torn caps of my nurses and the heavy blows I have given their heads and faces
                  will testify.”

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Clearly, then, as Pamela Woof has written, “even in these final years there was more
                  than imbecility to Dorothy Wordsworth; there are glimpses of what De Quincey calls
                  her ‘very originality’ . . . in the later letters, verses and journals.” 
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note9" id="Note9_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> Recognizing as much offers an important check upon any temptation to reduce the whole
                  of Notebook 15 to a tale of her physical and mental slide. It invites us to balance
                  Dorothy’s recurring complaints over the deaths of several dear friends, her own debilitating
                  maladies, and dispiriting political news from Westminster with other moments when
                  she exudes her trademark optimism and zest for life. The series of entries she wrote
                  as 1834 rolled over into 1835, for instance, are among the most affecting and exuberant
                  in the whole of the <em>RJ</em>. In her entry for 30 December, she describes how “W<sup>m</sup> came to me rejoiced to hear thickly pattering rain after so long a pause – I could
                  not but feel a touch of sympathy with him in remembrance of many a moist tramp; but
                  sh[oul]d have been better pleased with bright moon &amp; stars, &amp; our late splendid evenings
                  &amp; mornings.” Two days later, after noting the “Lovely sun-rise &amp; set,” she rhapsodizes,
                  “Never surely in the 63 years that I have lived can there have been such brilliant
                  New-years &amp; Christmas days.” And, in the same elevated strain, she writes on 2 January,
                  “Another year begun! and what a brilliant sun-rise – Oh! that men’s hearts could be <span style="text-decoration:underline">softened</span>! – then elevated by the goodness &amp; beauty of all that is done for &amp; spread before
                  us!”</p>
            </div>
            <p>Elsewhere, Notebook 15 paints a portrait of long days and nights in a sickroom, where,
               when well enough, Dorothy read newspapers and religious books, made rugs for friends,
               and welcomed visits from well-wishers. While the entries at the start of this volume
               show her reading voraciously, her stamina had waned by February 1835 to the point
               that she had become reliant on her goddaughter (and regular companion) Ebba Hutchinson
               reading to her aloud. Wary, no doubt, of the addiction that had plagued her friends
               Coleridge and De Quincey, Dorothy took to assiduously logging each time she opened
               a new bottle of laudanum, and—in what should prove a remarkable trove for historians
               of medicine—she details treatments including the bleeding and blistering regimens
               endured by her niece Dora and her own use of Morrison’s Pills, arrowroot biscuits,
               and divers concoctions prepared by her faithful attendant Mr. Carr. Especially amid
               the political tumult surrounding the general election of early 1835, Dorothy’s mood
               seems to have risen and fallen depending of how successful the Tories had been in
               staving off Whig offensives. Such is the case near the end of Notebook 15, when, in
               her entry for 30 March 1835, she initially expresses pleasure that the Wordsworths’
               new neighbor Dr. Thomas Arnold would be bringing to his family to the Lakes for Easter
               before remembering that the last visit of this “active zealous Doctor” had been “to
               vote for a Destructive Member” in the parliamentary election—a trip that, as she wryly
               and triumphantly notes, was “Happily not successful.”</p>
