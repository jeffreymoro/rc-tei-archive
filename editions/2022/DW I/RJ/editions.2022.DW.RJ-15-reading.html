               Dora’s condition had gradually improved, and DW had often struggled with acute physical
               pain and memory loss (<em>Letters</em>, 6:78, 83, 89). In a 26 September letter to his and DW’s brother Christopher, WW
               reported that “Our dear Sister is in bodily health undoubtedly much better” but “her
               mind received a shock upon the death of Miss Hutchinson from which is has never recovered.”
               More specifically, he noted that “her memory of passing events has greatly failed,
               and her judgements also in all that respects her disease, though not at all in other
               things. Indeed I think upon points of morals, character, literature, etc., she expresses
               herself as well or better than ever she did” (<em>Letters</em>, 6:96). Writing to Robert Southey two days later, however, he was less upbeat, fearing
               that her faltering memory and “impaired judgement” were side-effects of “the great
               quantity of opium which it has been thought proper to give her” (<em>Letters</em>, 6:100).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note194_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               a new poem for Dorothy Harrison (1825–73), the eldest daughter of her <a class="link_ref" href="/editions.DW.editions.2023.DW.RJ-15-index.html#Harrison">“Cousin Dorothy” Harrison</a> of Ambleside. Levin’s Longman edition includes a full version of this poem that is
               based on a fair copy that Elizabeth (“Ebba”) Hutchinson made in DW’s commonplace book
               (DCMS 120) in June 1835 (Levin, 215–17). Levin tentatively identifies the poem’s recipient
               as a daughter of George Hutchinson, MW’s youngest brother, but this is confuted by
               the fact that his Dora was not born until late 1835 (or several months after Ebba’s
               dated transcription of this poem) and survived for less than six months. Elsewhere
               in the Longman edition, Levin misidentifies DW’s initial pages of revisions to this
