At various points in 1825, the year when she completed her first <em>RJ</em> notebook (DCMS 104.1), Dorothy told one friend, “When the air is clear I can walk nine or ten miles or more with as little fatigue as ever I did in my life” and another that she could “walk as well as when but twenty years old, and can climb the hills better than in those days.” <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

Until her first major health crisis in the spring of 1829, only heavy rain and occasional aches and pains kept the middle-aged writer from spending her days wandering the Westmorland fells and her nights socializing among an ever-widening circle of friends.</p></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Like her brother William and sister-in-law Mary, Dorothy grew increasingly prone to wanderlust as the three surviving Wordsworth children came of age during the 1820s. Just how disencumbered she had become by 1825 is suggested by a letter explaining that what was supposed to be a week-long trip to see <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-1-reading.html#Cookson">the Cooksons</a> in Kendal had stretched to a fortnight because her friends begged her to stay, and, “having no particular object to call [her] home, [she] could not refuse.” <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

Not that her 1825 was entirely devoid of holidays, however, as we find her taking several multiday trips throughout the Lakes. For many readers, in fact, the highlight of Notebook 1 will be her entries for 5–8 July 1825, which break from her typical just-the-facts style to describe in vivid detail each leg of a four-day excursion across the region’s southern peninsulas. The expansive, keen-eyed, and witty style of these entries brings to mind sections of Dorothy’s travel narratives from Scotland and the Continent. <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

          </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>DW never appears to have returned to her 5–8 July entries to expand them into a proper “excursion,” but this may have been owing to the unexpected gap between the fourth (1823) and fifth (1835) editions of the Guide. By the time WW began working in earnest on the 1835 edition, DW lacked the requisite stamina for this sort of intensive writing project.</span></div></div></p></div><div class="wrapper"><p>All other sections of Notebook 1 chronicle daily rhythms and routines at Rydal Mount, offering an affecting portrait of Dorothy’s devotion to her closest family and friends and a clear window into the lives of the middle-aged Wordsworths and, more generally, the provincial English gentry of this period. Within the first few pages, it becomes clear that this was an unusually convivial period for Dorothy. Just how much of a social butterfly she had become was captured by <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-1-reading.html#SH">Sara Hutchinson</a>, who, upon returning to Rydal in August 1825 after a two-year absence, reported finding “dear Dorothy as well and active as ever—&amp; a knott of good friends around her—so that we are in no want of society which would have been no <span style="text-decoration:underline">loss</span> on my first arrival.” <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">

Just how few social niceties stood between her and her closest female friends is suggested by entries like that of 26 July 1825, in which she records how on this “loveliest of nights” she “called on Mrs Luff in her Bed-room – past 10.”</p></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Throughout Notebook 1, Dorothy mixes freely with young and old alike, displaying a particular relish for playing the surrogate aunt to the grown Cookson, Coleridge, and Southey children, whom she had known since their childhoods, and new favorites like <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-1-reading.html#Jewsbury">Maria Jane Jewsbury</a> and the <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-1-reading.html#Dowling">Dowling sisters</a>. Unlike her letters from the mid-1820s, in which she frequently rails against radicals and reformers, the <em>RJ</em> show Dorothy to be thoroughly ecumenical in her choice of friends, with her inner circle ranging beyond orthodox Anglicans and Tories to incorporate progressives like <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-1-reading.html#Barber">Samuel Barber</a> and the <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-1-reading.html#Marshall">Marshalls</a> and a bevy of Unitarians (<a class="link_ref" href="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-1-reading.html#Cookson">the Cooksons</a>), Catholics (the Quillinans), and Presbyterians (Mary Honeyman and <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-1-reading.html#Harden">the Hardens</a>). <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note8" id="Note8_return"><sup class="super">

For, not only do we repeatedly see her socializing with working folk in ways women of her rank would never seem to imagine in the contemporary novels of Jane Austen, but we even catch her commiserating with a Windermere ferryman about how “all the Land” above the lake . . . had been “divided among the Gentry” and opining that the surrounding hills would be considerably “more cheerful” if “scattered over with houses” of ordinary Dalesmen. <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note9" id="Note9_return"><sup class="super">

          </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>RJ, 8 July 1825.</span></div></div></p></div><p>Similarly compelling moments elsewhere in this first volume of the <em>RJ</em> capture the range and breadth of Dorothy’s reading and her enduring bonds with her brother, his family, and the natural wonders of the Lakes. And, especially through the lists of expenditures and favorite Bible verses she kept inside its front and back covers, we gain a deeper and more nuanced understanding of Dorothy’s sensibilities, both spiritual and material, than even the fullest biography provides. All told, then, however succinct and weather-obsessed the journal entries may be for pages at a time, those reading this edition’s transcription of Notebook 1 will find in it a consistently engaging and frequently illuminating portrait of a year in the life of one of the most fascinating figures of Britain’s Romantic age.</p></div></section></div>
