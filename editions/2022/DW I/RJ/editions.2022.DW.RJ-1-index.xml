                        beloved brother and long-time housemate. By the mid-1820s, WW enjoyed a growing
                        literary reputation and greater freedom to travel from home as his children came of
                        age and the household had more disposable income. Besides frequent periods when
                        intense eye pain rendered him unable to read or write, he was otherwise, by DW&#8217;s
                        report, &#8220;well but much thinner than he used to be, and this makes him look old.&#8221;

                        Along with his
                        responsibilities as Distributor of Stamps for Westmorland and political activities
                        as a major supporter of Tory causes and opponent of Reform, he still regularly
                        composed new poems and revised old ones, often with assistance from DW and MW.

                        The Wordsworths spent 1825 in dread of possibly
                        losing the lease to Rydal Mount at year&#8217;s end, with WW musing, &#8220;It would almost
                        break our hearts to be forced to quit it.&#8221;

                estranged wife and prodigy daughter of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Although Hartley had
                moved to Ambleside, Sarah and Sara remained in Keswick with Sarah&#8217;s sister, Edith
                Southey, and her family. In late 1824, the prestigious house of John Murray
                published Sara&#8217;s translation from the French of a book chronicling the Chevalier de
                Bayard&#8217;s exploits. After hosting the Coleridge women at Rydal Mount for a fortnight
                in April 1825, DW wrote, &#8220;Adversity is the best school, I believe, for the best of
                us; and poor Mrs Coleridge has had enough of it, in the shape of humiliation and
                disappointed hopes concerning the talents of her Sons. Dear Sara is a sweet
                creature, so thoughtful and gentle, patient and persevering—and in conversation not
                disputatious as she used to be.&#8221;

                From May 1824
                through October 1825, Margaret remained in the Lakes with their growing brood—the
                child she delivered in late 1824 was their fifth in seven years—while Thomas
                attempted to stave off creditors by writing feverishly for the London press. During
                the spring of 1825, in his absence, the family was turned out of Fox Ghyll, their
                home since 1820, by its new owner, Mrs. Luff. Thomas&#8217;s steep fall in the
                Wordsworths&#8217; eyes is manifest in Dora&#8217;s referring to her one-time favorite as &#8220;the
                poor little man&#8221; and MW disgustedly reporting in the spring of 1825 that the De

                who was the latest in a series of Dawsons employed by the family.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors"> See <title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:106, 156, 226, 427, and 3:140. 
                        &#8220;<emph>My</emph> Mary Dawson,&#8221; as the young Dora took to calling her, was a particular favorite, 
                        working for the Wordsworths at Dove Cottage in 1806&#8211;1807 and at Rydal Mount in 1814, with stints 
                        in the households of the De Quinceys and Lloyds (of Old Brathay). Another Dawson, Jane, worked 
                        briefly for the family in 1820, as evidenced by SH&#8217;s acidic contrast between the &#8220;daftness&#8221; of Jane
                        Dawson and the &#8220;more decorous&#8221; ways of &#8220;Old Mary&#8221; Dawson (<title level="m">LSH</title>, 201). The 
                        spelling of Ann&#8217;s name (which DW generally renders &#8220;Anne&#8221;) and her age come from the census record
                        for the inhabitants of Rydal Mount in 1841.
                    </note> 
                In Notebook 1, Ann is seen accompanying the Wordsworths on their summer holiday to
                Kents Bank and contracting a severe illness in the fall that DW tracked
                carefully.

                Soon after Ann arrived at Rydal Mount in 1823, DW remarked that she was &#8220;much admired not for her
                beauty but for her sensible countenance and respectable appearance.&#8221;
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors"><title level="m">Letters</title>, 4:219.</note> 
                Ann would ultimately stay with the family into the early 1840s, becoming a beloved and
                constant presence in the household.

                servant that takes delight in [Dora].&#8221; Alternately, if one reads the description in
                DW&#8217;s 17 January 1825 entry of the &#8220;Old Woman fallen down stairs&#8221; as appositional
                with &#8220;Betty Dawson,&#8221; she may have been the mother of Mary Dawson who had helped bury
                Catherine Wordsworth in 1812.

                    </note>
                Upon Peggy&#8217;s death in 1830, DW noted, &#8220;[Peggy] came to us when John was a Babe in arms&#8221;
                and the family had stayed &#8220;in daily intercourse with her to the last—and as she was
                our Servant at the very commencement of her course of life—a sweet-tempered innocent
                Girl and perfectly beautiful—we have always been interested for her—therefore her
                Sickness and Death have been like a domestic sorrow.&#8221;
