                Storm – wind rain flood – Chapel opened – Water falls
                    <note place="foott resp="editors">The Christmas Day opening of the
                            new chapel Lady Ann le Fleming had erected in Rydal was spoiled by
                            torrential rain. Dora wrote, “I never was out in such a storm, nor does
                            my Father ever remember experiencing so violent a one” 
                            (<ref target="https://tinyurl.com/mr356d7e">WLL / Wordsworth, Dora / 1 / 6</ref>). WW groused of the new chapel
                            that “the cost . . . much exceeded what was needful” but conceded that
                            “when time has softened down the exterior a little it will prove a great
                            ornament to the Village” (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 4:301). MW
                            considered it “a great monument to the Village,” despite “all the
                            blunders that have been made by the ignorance of the Builders” 
                            (<title level="m">LMW</title>, 120). Less equivocally, DW rejoiced that
                            Rydal was “beautified by our new Chapel which is a great comfort to us”
                            <title level="m">Letters</title>, 4:396).

                            Fox Ghyll to Mrs. Luff and turned out the De Quinceys, Margaret Blakeney
                            (1764–1828) held a multi-day sale of furnishings from the house. Decades
                            later, Thomas De Quincey would characterize such sales as highlights of
                            the Westmorland social calendar for rich and poor alike. Besides
                            offering free liquor (customarily at the seller’s expense) and
                            occasional bargains, these events facilitated reunions between old
                            acquaintances separated either by “real distance” or the “virtual
                            distance” created “by difficult tracts of hilly country” (“Recollections
                            of Grasmere,” 571). For another lively account of Westmorland moving
