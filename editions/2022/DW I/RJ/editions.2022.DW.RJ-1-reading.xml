                            new chapel Lady Ann le Fleming had erected in Rydal was spoiled by
                            torrential rain. Dora wrote, &#8220;I never was out in such a storm, nor does
                            my Father ever remember experiencing so violent a one&#8221; 
                            (<ref target="https://tinyurl.com/mr356d7e">WLL / Wordsworth, Dora / 1 / 6</ref>). WW groused of the new chapel
                            that &#8220;the cost . . . much exceeded what was needful&#8221; but conceded that
                            &#8220;when time has softened down the exterior a little it will prove a great
                            ornament to the Village&#8221; (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 4:301). MW
                            considered it &#8220;a great monument to the Village,&#8221; despite &#8220;all the
                            blunders that have been made by the ignorance of the Builders&#8221; 
                            (<title level="m">LMW</title>, 120). Less equivocally, DW rejoiced that
                            Rydal was &#8220;beautified by our new Chapel which is a great comfort to us&#8221;

                        of Moral Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. Among WW&#8217;s earliest
                         disciples, Wilson bought the Elleray estate near Bowness in his early
                            twenties largely for its proximity to his literary icon. For a decade
                            thereafter the Wilsons and Wordsworths enjoyed a close bond, but it was
                            severely strained after Wilson began publishing alternately admiring and
                            satirical <title level="m">Blackwood&#8217;s</title> articles on the &#8220;Lake

                            Letitia Luff, Eliza Dowling, and a Miss Woodville. Then, while the rest
                            of the party continued on by cart, DW and Henry Hutchinson (whom they
                            met in Coniston) traveled five miles by foot and boat to his summer
                            rental on Coniston Water. Thereafter details about her travel companions
                            are fuzzy, but at least WW and MW appear to have accompanied her on the
                            ten-mile cart ride to the Lund, Benson Harrison&#8217;s family home in

                            an Ulverston wine and spirits merchant and friend of Benson Harrison.
                            The widowed and ailing Mrs. Yarker would herself pass away five months
