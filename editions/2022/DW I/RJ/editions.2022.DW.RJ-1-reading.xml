                    <note place="foot" resp="editors"> Apparently not a major injury, as this is the only 
                        reference to it in <title level="m">RJ</title> or surviving letters. The entire 
                        family appears to have gone to Barber&#8217;s via the road that had just opened between 
                        Rydal and Grasmere. Comparing this new route (which remains the main thoroughfare 
                        today) and the old one, the <title level="m">Penny Magazine</title> explained in 
                        June 1837, &#8220;Between Rydal and Grasmere the high road formerly ran winding among, 
                        and over a succession of knolls; and being half hidden in its serpentine course, 
                        afforded a series of exquisite views, without deforming this lovely valley. But 
                        the steepness of the hills was ill suited to the convenience of increasing traffic, 
                        and about twelve years ago a new road was made, which runs close along the lower 
                        end of Grasmere, and is fenced from it by a long, straight, odious stone wall, 
                        which offends the eye, and cuts the sweetest part of the landscape with its 
                        rectilinear deformity&#8221; (247).

                        Quincey characterized them as highlights of the Westmorland social
