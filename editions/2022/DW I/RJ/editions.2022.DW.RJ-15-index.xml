                had grown feeble or passed away. In 1835 Henry Crabb Robinson described her as
                &#8220;perfect of her kind,&#8221; and Hartley Coleridge remarked in 1832 that &#8220;Mrs. W seems
                remarkably flourishing, and does not grow older. Indeed, both she and her excellent
                husband belong to that class of persons, who look very old at thirty and very young

                only surviving daughter, who, partly owing to her fragile health, continued to live
                with her parents at RM. In her twenties, Dora had had at least two serious suitors:
                her distant cousin Lt. Tom Robinson in 1825 (as chronicled in Notebook 1) and Rev.
                William Ayling, a visitor to Rydal who unexpectedly proposed in 1830 and was
                decisively rejected.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">For details on Ayling&#8217;s surprise proposal, see <title level="m">Letters</title>,
                        5:429n. Years later, Dora conjectured that Ayling and his family &#8220;only wanted [her] among them because [she]
                        was Wordsworth&#8217;s daughter&#8221; (<hi rend="italic">LDW</hi>, 90).</note> 
                Between her chronic illnesses and an apparent eating disorder, Dora grew so feeble in the mid-1830s that
                her parents openly referred to her and DW as the twin &#8220;Invalids&#8221; of RM and WW
                privately worried that his daughter might need to be sent away, as &#8220;the state of
                [her] poor Aunt causes so much Distress to Dora that <hi rend="italic">she</hi>
                cannot I am sure recover, if she remains here.&#8221; &#8220;The most painful part,&#8221;

                boarding school in Wiltshire. While devoutly Christian and deeply moralistic, he zealously
                campaigned for ecclesiastical and parliamentary reform, often leaving him at odds

                In the early 1830s Mr. Carr scaled back his practice and the childless couple moved from Cumpstone

                several times in a week when Dora&#8217;s or DW&#8217;s condition required. While DW teased him

                A retired East India Company surgeon and his literary wife, whose debut verse collection of 
                1824 had garnered praise from such poetic luminaries as WW, Robert Southey, and Joanna
                Baillie. The Godwins were married soon after this volume&#8217;s release and settled in
                Barbon, the village in the southeast corner of Westmorland where she had spent most
                of her adolescence. In 1829 Mrs. Godwin dedicated her second collection, 
                <title level="m">The Wanderer&#8217;s Legacy</title>, to WW, and it was in hopes of forging
                a closer relationship with him and his family that she and her husband repeatedly
                leased Spring Cottage in Loughrigg in ensuing years, including during the period of
