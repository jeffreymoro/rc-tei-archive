                <p>Contrary to the lingering notion that the <title level="m">Rydal Journals</title> 
                (<title level="m">RJ</title>) are, above all, a chronicle of Dorothy Wordsworth&#8217;s
                inexorable, decade-long slide into infirmity and senescence, the first nine of its
                15 notebooks capture the tireless comings and goings of a hale and hearty
                50-something relishing a new stage of life with fewer household duties and relative
                financial security. At various points in 1825, the year when she completed her first
                <title level="m">RJ</title> notebook (DCMS 104.1), Dorothy told
                one friend, &#8220;When the air is clear I can walk nine or ten miles or more with as
                little fatigue as ever I did in my life&#8221; and another that she could &#8220;walk as well as
                when but twenty years old, and can climb the hills better than in those days.&#8221;
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">DW to
                            Elizabeth Crump, late April 1825 (<title level="m">Letters</title>,

                    </note>
                If anything, the first several volumes of the <title level="m">RJ</title> log 
                proportionally fewer days when Dorothy was confined to a sickbed than her 
                <title level="m">Grasmere Journal</title>
                from a quarter-century before. Until her first major health crisis in the spring of
                1829, only heavy rain and occasional aches and pains kept the middle-aged writer
                from spending her days wandering the Westmorland fells and her nights socializing
                among an ever-widening circle of friends.
            </p>
                
            <p>Like her brother William and sister-in-law Mary, Dorothy grew increasingly prone to
                wanderlust as the three surviving Wordsworth children came of age during the 1820s.
                Just how disencumbered she had become by 1825 is suggested by a letter explaining
                that what was supposed to be a week-long trip to see 
                <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-1-reading.html#Cookson">the Cooksons</ref> 
                in Kendal had stretched to a fortnight because her friends begged
                her to stay, and, &#8220;having no particular object to call [her] home, [she] could not
                refuse.&#8221;

                While her ultimate travel dream was to take another trip
                to the Continent,

                        Continental tour never came to fruition.

                she settled in
                the meantime for extended excursions in the British Isles, including a seven-week

                10-month stay with family and friends in the Midlands in 1826, and a trip with
                William to the Isle of Man in the summer of 1828.
            </p>
                
            <p>All of this travel in surrounding years makes Notebook 1 something of an outlier, as
                Dorothy spent the entire year it covers (11 December 1824&#8211;9 December 1825) in anchor
                at Rydal Mount. Not that her 1825 was entirely devoid of holidays, however, as we
                find her taking several multiday trips throughout the Lakes. For many readers, in
                fact, the highlight of Notebook 1 will be her entries for 5–8 July 1825, which break
                from her typical just-the-facts style to describe in vivid detail each leg of a
                four-day excursion across the region&#8217;s southern peninsulas. The expansive,
                keen-eyed, and witty style of these entries brings to mind sections of Dorothy&#8217;s
                travel narratives from Scotland and the Continent.

                Perhaps even closer parallels, though, can be found in the shorter accounts she made of her

                it seems entirely possible that
                Dorothy composed this distinctive segment of Notebook 1 in anticipation of her
                brother&#8217;s wanting to include a third Lake District &#8220;excursion&#8221; in some later edition
                of his guidebook.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">DW never appears to have returned to her 5&#8211;8 July
                         entries to expand them into a proper &#8220;excursion,&#8221; but this may have been
                         owing to the unexpected gap between the fourth (1823) and fifth (1835)
                         editions of the <title level="m">Guide</title>. By the time WW began
                         working in earnest on the 1835 edition, DW lacked the requisite stamina
                         for this sort of intensive writing project.

            <p>All other sections of Notebook 1 chronicle daily rhythms and routines at Rydal Mount,
                offering an affecting portrait of Dorothy&#8217;s devotion to her closest family and
                friends and a clear window into the lives of the middle-aged Wordsworths and, more
                generally, the provincial English gentry of this period. Within the first few pages,
                it becomes clear that this was an unusually convivial period for Dorothy. Just how
                much of a social butterfly she had become was captured by <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-1-reading.html#SH">Sara
                Hutchinson</ref>, who, upon returning to Rydal in August 1825 after a two-year
                absence, reported finding &#8220;dear Dorothy as well and active as ever&#8212;&amp; a knott of
                good friends around her&#8212;so that we are in no want of society which would have been
                no <hi rend="underline">loss</hi> on my first arrival.&#8221;
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">SH to John Monkhouse, 7 August

                Functioning as something of a hub for her &#8220;knott of good friends,&#8221; she inspired
                intimates like <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-1-reading.html#Luff">Letitia Luff </ref>and

                to relocate to the environs of Rydal
                and frequently brought together old neighbors, distant cousins, and respectable new
                arrivals to the area. Just how few social niceties stood between her and her closest
                female friends is suggested by entries like that of 26 July 1825, in which she
                records how on this &#8220;loveliest of nights&#8221; she &#8220;called on Mrs Luff in her Bed-room –
                past 10.&#8221;
            </p>
                
            <p>Throughout Notebook 1, Dorothy mixes freely with young and old alike, displaying a
                particular relish for playing the surrogate aunt to the grown Cookson, Coleridge,
                and Southey children, whom she had known since their childhoods, and new favorites
                like <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-1-reading.html#Jewsbury">Maria Jane Jewsbury</ref> 
                and the <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-1-reading.html#Dowling">Dowling sisters</ref>. 
                Unlike her letters from the mid-1820s, in which she frequently
                rails against radicals and reformers, the <title level="m">RJ</title> show Dorothy to
                be thoroughly ecumenical in her choice of friends, with her inner circle ranging
                beyond orthodox Anglicans and Tories to incorporate progressives like 
                <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-1-reading.html#Barber">Samuel Barber</ref> and the

                Her 1825 diary may, in
                fact, reveal flickering embers of her youthful republicanism. For, not only do we
                repeatedly see her socializing with working folk in ways women of her rank would
                never seem to imagine in the contemporary novels of Jane Austen, but we even catch
                her commiserating with a Windermere ferryman about how &#8220;all the Land&#8221; above the lake
                . . . had been &#8220;divided among the Gentry&#8221; and opining that the surrounding hills
                would be considerably &#8220;more cheerful&#8221; if &#8220;scattered over with houses&#8221; of ordinary
                    Dalesmen.

            <p>Similarly compelling moments elsewhere in this first volume of the <title level="m">RJ</title> 
                capture the range and breadth of Dorothy&#8217;s reading and her enduring
                bonds with her brother, his family, and the natural wonders of the Lakes. And,
                especially through the lists of expenditures and favorite Bible verses she kept
                inside its front and back covers, we gain a deeper and more nuanced understanding of
                Dorothy&#8217;s sensibilities, both spiritual and material, than even the fullest
                biography provides. All told, then, however succinct and weather-obsessed the
                journal entries may be for pages at a time, those reading this edition&#8217;s
                transcription of Notebook 1 will find in it a consistently engaging and frequently
                illuminating portrait of a year in the life of one of the most fascinating figures
                of Britain&#8217;s Romantic age.
