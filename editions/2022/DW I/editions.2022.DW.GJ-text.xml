            as I could amongst the stones<lb/>
            of the shore. The wood<lb/>
            rich in flowers. A beau-<lb/>

            Bull &amp; a cow – he walked<lb/>
            with two sticks. Came home<lb/>
            by Clappersgate. The valley<lb/>
            very green – many sweet views<lb/>
            up to Rydale head when<lb/>
            I could juggle away the<lb/>

            disturbed me even more<lb/>
