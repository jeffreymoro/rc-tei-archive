                    wife of Thomas Clarkson (1760&#8211;1846), later this week (see entry for 6 September). 
                    They became close friends and regular correspondents. The Clarksons lived from 
                    1794 to 1803 in the Lakes, at Eusemere, on Ullswater. Thomas Clarkson was a 
                    well-known abolitionist who worked alongside William Wilberforce and others.

            Their foot marks do not trouble me<lb/>

            And to the last were good and kind<lb/>
            Methinks ‘tis strange I did not perish<lb/>
            The Moment I was left behind</p>
                
            <p>Why do I watch those running deer<lb/>

            And wherefore do I seem to love<lb/>

            To me the people of a dream<lb/>
            A dream in which there is no love<lb/>

            [Seven illegible words]<lb/>
            One moment one to me arrive<lb/>
            When I could live without a pain<lb/>
            And feel no wish to be alive<lb/>
            In quiet hopelessness I sleep<lb/>
            Alas how quiet and how deep!</p>
                
            <p>Ah no I do not cannot rue<lb/>
            I did not strive to follow you<lb/>
            I might have dropp&#8217;d &amp; died alone<lb/>
            On unknown snows, a spot unknown<lb/>
            This spot to me must needs be dear<lb/>

            <p>Alas that one beloved, forlorn<lb/>
            Should lie beneath the cold starlight<lb/>
            With them I think I could have borne<lb/>
            The journey of another night<lb/>
            And with my friends now far away<lb/>
            I could have lived another day.
