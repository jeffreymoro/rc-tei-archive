            <p>A lively friend of Dorothy who was a writer, a music teacher, an amateur painter,
               and a fell walker. Mary met Robert Southey in Portugal in 1800 and became a close
               friend, eventually settling next door to his family in Keswick (1812–1817). Over time,
               she became acquainted with the broader Southey-Coleridge-Wordsworth circle, close
               especially with Dorothy and Sara Hutchinson. In 1816, she overextended herself financially
               to build a new home in Rosthwaite, Borrowdale, where she lived for just a short time,
               despite her love for the landscape and having become an “active climber of the hills.”
               This house was the starting place for the 1818 Scafell Pike. In the following year,
               Mary moved to Boulogne in order to retrench and never returned to England, but the
               Wordsworths continued to correspond with her, and they visited her in France during
               their 1820 Continental Tour. In 1830, she married a younger man named Mr. Slade, concerning
               her friends at home. The most complete source on her life is David Bradbury’s <em>Senhora Small Fry: Mary Barker and the Lake Poets</em>(2003).</p>

            <p>Childless couple who were major patrons of the arts and, from 1803, close friends
               of the Wordsworths. Sir George was an amateur landscape painter, art collector, and
               major force in establishing the National Gallery. He married Margaret, the granddaughter
               of Lord Chief Justice John Willes, in 1778, and the two honeymooned at Keswick. Revisiting
               the town 25 years later, they met the Coleridges, Southeys, and William Wordsworth.
               Soon thereafter, Lady Margaret and Dorothy struck up an epistolary friendship, and,
               although they wouldn’t meet in person until 1806, Dorothy apparently composed her
               journal-like 
               “<a class="link_ref" href="/editions.DW.editions.2023.DW.Ulls-intro">Excursion on the Banks of Ullswater </a>(apparatus)”
               for her new friend in 1805. In later years the Wordsworths would regularly visit them
               at their Leicestershire estate, Coleorton, and their London townhouse in Grosvenor
               Square.</p>

               a plan that called for advanced students to tutored their less advanced peers which
               he developed at an orphan asylum in India. Bell met the Wordsworths through his close
               friend and later biographer Robert Southey. According to Southey’s <em>Life</em>, after Bell requested Dorothy’s feedback on his Madras school book, she “spent much
               time and labour in remodeling the work for him, and, indeed, entirely rewrote it,
               much to his apparent satisfaction at the time; subsequently, however, he threw this
               manuscript aside, and published it nearly as he had originally composed it.” William
               Johnson, the addressee of Dorothy’s 1818 Scafell Pike letter, was the head of Bell’s
               Central School in London. As a link between Dorothy, Johnson, and Lord Kenyon, Bell
               may have been involved in the production of the 
               “Kenyon Transcript.”
               By his death in 1832, his National Society for the Education of the Poor in the Principles
               of the Christian Church had charge of more than 12,000 schools.</p>

               at Mrs. Fletcher’s school for girls. After taking over the school in 1818, she briefly
               employed her former student Dora Wordsworth as a teacher. In the early 1830s, the
               Carrs moved from Cumpstone Lodge in Ambleside to Hill Top in Near Sawrey, a home now
               associated with its later occupant, Beatrix Potter.</p>

            <p>Couple whom William Wordsworth met in 1799 while touring the Lake District with Samuel

               Ullswater estate in 1794 when the war with France stalled the movement to end slavery.
               Two years later, he married Catherine Buck of Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, a like-minded
               gentlewoman. According to her childhood friend (and later boon companion of the Wordsworths)
               Henry Crabb Robinson, she “was the most eloquent woman I have ever known, with the
               exception of Madame de Staël. She had a quick apprehension of every kind of beauty
               and made her own whatever she learned.” Though the Clarksons left the Lakes in 1804,
               when Thomas returned to public life, their friendship with the Wordsworths endured
               and Caroline became one of Dorothy’s most regular correspondents. In 1807, Thomas
               would help achieve the long-delayed passage of the Slave Trade Act.</p>

               teach at his former school, and returning to periodical writing after the school was

            <p>Poet, critic, philosopher, walker, and beloved early friend of Dorothy and William
               Wordsworth. In 1800, Coleridge and his wife, Sara, moved to Greta Hall in Keswick,
               13 miles from Dove Cottage. In 1804, he left Keswick (and his troubled marriage) for
               Malta and Italy in hopes of recovering his physical and mental health. He returned
               little recovered in 1806 and almost immediately separated from his wife, leaving her
               and his daughter at Keswick with the Southeys but arranging for his boys to attend

            <p>Sara Hutchinson was the unmarried younger sister of Mary Wordsworth, a close friend
               of Dorothy’s, and for many years an integral part of the Wordsworth household. Best
               known, perhaps, as “Asra,” the woman with whom S. T. Coleridge hopelessly fell in
               love in 1799 (distressing all families concerned), she was an eager mountaineer, a
               lively correspondent, and a keen mind. It was to her that Dorothy and Mary Barker
               wrote from the summit of Scafell Pike in 1818. Coleridge said of Sara, “If Sense,
               Sensibility, Sweetness of Temper, perfect Simplicity and an unpretending Nature, joined
               to shrewdness &amp; entertainingness, make a valuable Woman, Sarah H. is so.” Joanna was
               the youngest Hutchinson sister, also unmarried, and also a frequent visitor and companion
               to Dorothy. Together they traveled to Scotland in 1822 and the Isle of Man in 1828.
               Dorothy wrote “Lines addressed to Joanna H. from Gwerndovennant June 1826” to this
               valued sister-in-law. Sara and Joanna both kept house at times for their brother Thomas,
               who farmed in various locations, including Gallow Hill (Yorkshire), Park House (near
               Ullswater), and Hindwell (Mid Wales).</p>

               He was intimate with the Wordsworths, and Sara Hutchinson’s letters indicate that
               he was thought a possible match for her sister Joanna. Johnson was born in Cumberland
               but ended up spending much of his career in London, having been hired by Dr. Andrew
               Bell to run a new model school established by the National Society for the Education
               of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church. His work in training students
               and fellow teachers was essential to the success of the National Society and of Bell’s
               Madras system. When he died, an obituary in <em>The Gentleman’s Magazine</em>called him the “Patriarch of National Education.”</p>

            <p>A Quaker, poet, abolitionist, and travel writer who lived on his small estate near
               Yanwath, south of Penrith. He was hired by William Lowther to superintend improvements
               on his grounds, which had been neglected by the previous Lord Lonsdale. Wordsworthians
               often remember him as the author of the passage (in his <em>Tours of the British Mountains</em>) that inspired 
               “The Solitary Reaper,”
               which was composed just before the Wordsworths’ Ullswater tour of November 1805. Wilkinson
               counted Edmund Burke, Coleridge, the Clarksons, William Wilberforce, and the Wordsworths
               among his many friends.</p>

            <p>William and Dorothy’s youngest sibling. He spent most of adolescence at Hawkshead
               Grammar School before matriculating at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1792. He eventually
               received three degrees: a BA in 1796, MA in 1799, and DD in 1810. Largely through
               his connections with the archbishop of Canterbury, he became a rector in Norfolk in
               1804 and domestic chaplain to the archbishop a year later. In later years, he would
               hold a series of clerical and academic appointments, which provided a platform for
               his regular defenses of conservative and High Church causes. His largest impact, however,
               came as an administrator at Trinity College, Cambridge, during the 1820s and 1830s,
               where he oversaw a series of educational and clerical reforms. In 1804 he married
               Priscilla Lloyd, the daughter of a wealthy Birmingham banker who, after bearing three
               sons, tragically died in 1815.</p>

            </header>
            <p>William and Mary Wordsworth’s oldest and only surviving daughter, who was particularly
               close to her father and protective of his literary reputation. Her namesake, Dorothy,
               was something of a third parent to her, often serving as her main disciplinarian and
               nursing her through chronic illnesses. After struggling in various educational establishments,
               Dora flourished when Ann Dowling took over the girls’ school in Ambleside in 1818.
               In adulthood, Dora gradually replaced Dorothy as William’s principal scribe and traveling
               companion, accompanying him and Coleridge on their summer 1828 tour of Northern Europe.
               In 1839, William rejected Edward Quillinan’s request for Dora’s hand, ostensibly because
               of this family friend’s Catholicism and troubled finances but also because of the
               poet’s deep dependence on his daughter. Eventually, however, he relented and blessed
               the couple’s May 1841 union. After convalescing from a serious illness in Portugal
               in 1845 and 1846, Dora returned to Rydal Mount, dying there in July 1847.</p>

            <p>Sailor brother of Dorothy and William who planned to establish a permanent home with
               them in Grasmere. In 1800 he was appointed captain of the<span style="font-style:italic">Earl of Abergavenny</span>, one of East India Company’s largest merchant ships. Five years later, he and over
               200 others died in a shipwreck caused by pilot error off the southern coast of England.
               Besides leaving his siblings with a permanent sense of loss, his death also proved
               a financial blow, as they had invested heavily in his personal cargo. Nine months
               after his death, Dorothy and William were still in deep mourning during their Ullswater
               tour of November 1805.</p>

            <p>William and Mary Wordsworth’s oldest child. While widely considered a dull-witted
               disappointment outside the family, he remained a favorite of Dorothy, who was something
               of a second mother to William’s children. Owing to fears that John would not be able
               to pass the mathematics requirement at his father’s alma mater, Cambridge, William
               arranged for his matriculation at New College, Oxford, from which he graduated in
               1826. After taking orders, he received the curacy at Whitwick near Coleorton in 1828
               and several subsequent livings as a result of his father’s connections. In 1830, John
               married Isabella Curwen, daughter of an influential Lake District MP, with whom he
               had six children before her death in 1848.</p>

            <p>William and Mary’s youngest child, born within months of his parents’ respective fortieth
               birthdays. His reputation for being lazy and spoiled was captured by a mock advertisement
               his sister Dora and Maria Jane Jewsbury wrote in 1825: “Wants a Situation. A youth
               of about fifteen years of age. He is able to do any kind of work, but prefers sitting
               to standing, riding to walking, and lying in bed to anything in the world.” Forbidden
               by his parents from joining the army in 1828, Willy remained largely aimless until
               his father made him his Sub-distributor of Stamps in 1831, which paved the way for
               him to replace William as Distributor in 1842. He married Fanny Eliza Graham in 1847,
               with whom he had four children.</p>
