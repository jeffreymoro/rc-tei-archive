                <p>On 6 November 1805, just as mild weather gave way to autumn rain, Dorothy and William
                Wordsworth set out to see their friends Charles and Letitia Luff in Patterdale, 12
                miles northeast of Grasmere on the southern tip of Ullswater.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Composing in the form of a journal, DW divides her account into days. However, as often happens in her 
                    journals, she mistakes the dates. As noted, she and WW left Grasmere on Wednesday, 6 November (not on 7 November, as stated in her manuscripts) 
                    and returned on the night of Tuesday, 12 November. Therefore, when DW mentions a date, readers should simply subtract one, though she is accurate 
                    in identifying the days of the week.
                    </note>
                They planned for only a short visit but ended up spending a week exploring what
                Dorothy called the &#8220;wonderful country&#8221; around England&#8217;s second-largest lake.

                Her account of this tour, <title level="a">Excursion on the Banks of Ullswater</title> (hereafter <title level="a">Ullswater Excursion</title>), 
                    presents her observations and experiences in genial prose. Since many of the landmarks she mentions remain today, much of what she saw appears 
                    in our <ref target="https://tinyurl.com/bdfunzhh">

            <p>Dorothy&#8217;s Ullswater tour was essentially a counterclockwise circuit of the lake
                punctuated by side excursions. Afterward, she summarized her itinerary for her
                friend Catherine Clarkson: &#8220;William and I spent three days at Luff&#8217;s and three at
                Park house.

                If we add that the siblings crossed the Kirkstone Pass (1,489 ft.&#8212;the Lake
                District&#8217;s highest road) to reach the Luffs&#8217; and that six days later they marched
                down Ullswater&#8217;s long western shore and traversed Kirkstone again, we can imagine
                something like the trip&#8217;s full circle (see fig. 3.1).</p>

                                formula needs slight qualification in this case, given that DW was
                                not for the most part exploring new territory. She had been to
                                Ullswater many times, so the novelty of the trip had mainly to do
                                with circumstances. Still, she and WW wished to visit &#8220;some of the
                                vales tributary to Ullswater, where [they had] never been before&#8221;

                It belongs to the Dove Cottage period, when Dorothy also produced her <title level="m">Grasmere Journals</title> (1800&#8211;1803) and 
                    <title level="m">Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland, A.D. 1803</title>. In fact, <title level="a">Ullswater Excursion</title> was composed

                    but DW completed her first clean copy of the text on 31 May 1805, and the earliest surviving manuscript is a copy made at Patterdale by 
                    DW&#8217;s friend Catherine Clarkson on 1 November 1805, less than a week before the author&#8217;s Ullswater tour. For details, see

                    she wrote to Catherine Clarkson in late 1803, &#8220;not a Journal, for we took no notes, but <hi rend="italic">recollections</hi> of our Tour in the 
                    form of a Journal&#8221; (<title level="m">Letters</title> 1:421). In truth, DW did make a few hasty notes in Scotland, but she wished she had written 
                    more (see Carol Kyros Walker&#8217;s editorial introduction to <title level="m">Recollections</title>, 20).
                </note>
                As Ernest de Sélincourt explained, her Scottish journal was &#8220;written at leisure
                after her return, while the events recorded were still vivid in her memory, and when
                she could see the whole tour in something of artistic perspective&#8221;; the same seems
                to be true of the Ullswater text.

                    While Dorothy included some details from the trip in a <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.Ulls-letters">letter</ref> she wrote on the
                trip&#8217;s second day, she apparently waited until after her return to Grasmere to draft the full narrative.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">Unfortunately, the manuscripts do not indicate composition dates; each simply begins &#8220;November 1805.&#8221; However, 
                    given that DW was still describing details of the trip in letters to Catherine Clarkson and Lady Beaumont at the end of November 
                    (see <title level="m">Letters</title>, 1:646&#8211;47, 648&#8211;52), she likely had not yet completed her
                                complete account by then. Her late-November letters also indicate
                                that she had been ill and quite busy, probably without much leisure
                                to write. Possibly she finished drafting the narrative in December
                                1805 or January 1806.

                <p>Why she wrote this account, and for whom, is not altogether clear. As the <title level="m">Grasmere Journals</title> (1800&#8211;1803) 
                demonstrate, personal and shared memories routinely jostled
                together in her notebooks, and she often recorded experiences as potential sources
                for her own future writing or for William&#8217;s. In <title level="a">Ullswater Excursion,</title> she records
                joyful moments with her brother, yet she clearly has an external audience in mind.
                She remarks in her report on day 2, &#8220;To attempt to <hi rend="italic">describe</hi>
                the place would be absurd when you for whom I write have been there, or may go
                thither as soon as you like.&#8221; Thus, her first intended reader (or readers) must have
                lived in or near the Lake District or had the means to visit easily. She might have
                said, as she later did concerning her Scottish tour, &#8220;I wrote my journal, or rather
                <hi rend="italic">recollections</hi> for the sake of my Friends who it seemed
                ought to have been with us, but were confined at home by other duties.&#8221;

                At this point, seemingly, she had no thoughts of print publication.

                <p>In 1941, De Sélincourt speculated that Dorothy wrote <title level="a">Ullswater Excursion</title> for Lady
                Margaret Beaumont, citing William&#8217;s 1823 explanation that it &#8220;was written for one
                acquainted with the general features of the country.&#8221;

                In light of the letters Dorothy sent to Lady Beaumont during and just after the
                Ullswater tour, she was likely the one of whom William spoke <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.Ulls-letters">(see section appendix)
                </ref>. Although the two women had yet to meet in person, they had been carrying on a warm correspondence.
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors">See, for instance, DW&#8217;s affectionate letter of 27 October: &#8220;I am sure I seem to know you very well. 
                        I have the same kind of pleasure in thinking of you as if I had really seen you, I am reminded of you by things daily before our eyes, 
                        just as if you had been often with us, had frequented the same paths and were familiar with the retired places of our valley&#8221; 
                        (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 1:630&#8211;31).
                        </note>
                Perhaps Lady Beaumont, enthused by Dorothy&#8217;s letters, had
                asked for a longer, more circumstantial account of her adventure. She and her
                husband, Sir George, were generous patrons as well as friends to the Wordsworths, so
                Dorothy was understandably eager to please them. <title level="a">Ullswater Excursion</title> might, then,
                be read as a reciprocal gift offered in a spirit of gratitude.
                </p>
            
                <p>As detailed more fully in Section II, two manuscript versions of <title level="a">Ullswater
                Excursion</title> survive. The first, preserved in one of Dorothy&#8217;s notebooks, is slightly
                longer and somewhat messier, while the second&#8212;a fair copy likely prepared for Lady
                Beaumont&#8212;removes some details while offering clarifications and stylistic
                adjustments. Regrettably, we know little about the manuscripts&#8217; use or possible
                circulation. Our primary clues about their reception are the simple facts already
                related: one copy was carefully preserved by the Beaumonts, and the other, retained
                by Dorothy herself, remained significant in Wordsworth family memory. William
                thought highly enough of it to make it part of his Lakeland guidebook, and, years
                later, nephew Christopher mentioned it in his 1851 <title level="m">Memoirs of
                William Wordsworth</title>, acknowledging the authorship of his aunt.
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors"><title level="m">Memoirs</title>, 1:319. Christopher&#8217;s revelation that 
                            <title level="a">Ullswater Excursion</title> was &#8220;from Miss Wordsworth&#8217;s pen&#8221; made no 
                            significant ripple in the reception record, but at least he was able to recognize DW&#8217;s work four years
                            before her death. At that point, the <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> version of her narrative, 
                            generally thought to be WW&#8217;s, had been in print for 28 years.

            <p>Dorothy composed <title level="a">Ullswater Excursion</title> at a time distinguished by creative
                accomplishment but also by personal and family worries. She left a good deal unsaid.
                For instance, when she reports that &#8220;Derwent ran to meet us,&#8221; informed readers
                should picture a five-year-old who has not seen his father for almost two years,
                eager to embrace some of the most important adults in his life. The missing father,
                Samuel Taylor Coleridge, appears by name at only one point, yet his perplexing
                absence hangs in the air. Then, to acknowledge another powerful absence, when
                Dorothy describes coming in view of &#8220;the mountains above Grisedale,&#8221; ostensibly
                making the plainest sort of topographical reference, she unavoidably has in mind her
                beloved brother John&#8212;Captain John Wordsworth, who died in a shipwreck in February.
                It was near Grisedale Tarn that she and William parted with him after his last visit
                to Grasmere, bidding farewell as he rushed down the Ullswater side of the mountains,
                full of hope about his coming voyage on the <hi rend="italic">Earl of
                Abergavenny</hi>. It was there, too, that William had found a vent for his
                feelings in early June, composing an elegy through tears.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">See WW&#8217;s &#8220;I only look&#8217;d for pain and grief&#8221; (<title level="m">Major Works</title>,08&#8211;11),

                    </note>
                As Dorothy exclaimed in her 9 June letter to Lady Beaumont, &#8220;Oh! My dear Friend, you
                will not wonder that we love that place.&#8221;
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors"><title level="m">Letters</title>, 1:598&#8211;99.</note>
                Similarly, when in <title level="a">Ullswater Excursion</title> she recounts the tale of two local brothers
                drowning (thus explaining the name of &#8220;Brothers Water&#8221;), it seems unimaginable that
                she isn&#8217;t also reflecting on the recent drowning of her own brother. And might she
                not also think of him when she describes learning about the death of Admiral Nelson
                at Trafalgar?
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">In her 29 November letter to Lady Beaumont, DW recalls that the sudden news of Nelson&#8217;s 
                    death caused her to burst into tears. Just before this, she reports that &#8220;the Image of our departed Brother haunts me with many a pang&#8221; 
                    and confesses her worry that STC may face dangers at sea <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.Ulls-letters">(<title level="m">Letters</title>, 1:648&#8211;45)</ref>.

            <p>Indeed, with all of these interweaving stories in mind, Dorothy&#8217;s <title level="a">Ullswater
                Excursion,</title> for all its frankness, actually seems reticent. Most of its emotional
                iceberg remains underwater. Then again, Dorothy apparently had no need to explain
                such personal contexts to her first readers. Perhaps an implicit understanding of
                circumstances was part of what she had in mind when she wrote to Lady Beaumont on 29
                November, &#8220;To make [our daily goings-on and my own peculiar feelings] interesting
                love must be in your heart.&#8221;

            <p>Because Dorothy&#8217;s original readers (in manuscript) must have been relatively few, the
                reception of the Ullswater text becomes easier to follow once it finds its way into
                print. Both of Dorothy&#8217;s &#8220;excursions&#8221;&#8212;<ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.SP-intro">

                (1805)&#8212;have been widely admired since they first appeared, respectively, in the

                Lakes</title>. Though written some 13 years apart, these texts were forever linked
                by being placed alongside each other (and similarly transformed) in all editions or

                forward (see fig. 3.2).

            <p>Whether quoting from them or reproducing them in full, Victorian travel books
                consistently attributed both excursions to William, largely as a result of his never

                At the 1883 gathering of the Wordsworth Society, Stopford Brooke attempted to
                support his argument about William&#8217;s propensity for &#8220;falling into the modes of
                poetry [even] in the midst of his prose&#8221; by quoting several remarkable passages from
                the <title level="m">Guide</title> actually written by Dorothy.

                again anthologized as by the famous poet rather than his sister.

            <p>On one level, the Wordsworth siblings&#8217; journey to Ullswater was a house-hunting trip.
                Fond as they were of Dove Cottage, it was becoming too small for the growing family
                and its regular house guests, especially in the wintertime, when everyone spent more
                time indoors. In November 1805, William and Mary had two children under the age of
                three and were expecting their third.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">John was born on 18 June 1803 and Dora on 16 August 1804. Thomas would be born on 15 June 1806.</note>
                Moreover, they longed to become homeowners, as evidenced in numerous letters from
                this period contemplating possible locations and building projects. An early
                highlight of the trip to Ullswater, then, was inspecting Broad How, an attractive
                lot for sale near the Luffs&#8217; home in Patterdale. Almost immediately, as Dorothy&#8217;s
                account chronicles, they began imagining a dream home there, and to that end William
                visited their friend Thomas Wilkinson to ask for help negotiating the purchase of
                this property.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Some details about discovering the potential house site appear in one manuscript (DCMS 51) 
                    but not in the other (Coleorton). DW writes in the more detailed account, &#8220;Our fancies could not resist the temptation &amp; 
                    we fixed upon a spot for a cottage which we began to build &amp; finished as easily as castles are raised in the air.&#8221;
                    </note>
                Ultimately, with the help of Lord Lowther, William did purchase it in 1806. He held
                on to this plot for nearly 30 years but never did remodel the old home that stood
                there or build a new one.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">On the acquisition of Broad How, see Gill, 253; Knight, <title level="m">Life of William

                    of the Wordsworth Country</title>, 180&#8211;81. As DW reports, WW first visited Wilkinson on the evening of Saturday, 9 November,
                    after leaving DW at Park House. Then WW and DW (along with SH and one of the Misses Green) returned to Wilkinson&#8217;s house on
                    Monday, 11 November on their way to visit Lowther Woods, taking Wilkinson as their guide. WW walked Wilkinson home that evening
                    while DW and the others waited at Red Hill. No doubt the men talked business. WW and DW returned to Grasmere on the following day,
                    apparently confident that their property negotiations would be in good hands. In the end, the deal did not transpire exactly as 
                    WW wished, but he reluctantly accepted the terms. Lord Lowther put up &#35;1,000, though WW had said the land was worth no more 
                    than &#35;800.
                    </note>
                To alleviate the crowding problem in Grasmere, the Wordsworths spent the winter of 1806&#8211;1807
                at Coleorton as guests of the Beaumonts, and in 1808 they moved from Dove Cottage to Allan Bank.

                <p><title level="a">Ullswater Excursion</title> also records the Wordsworths taking strength
                from their extended network of friends and family, including the Hutchinsons at Park House and
                Captain John Wordsworth at Brougham Hall. (Captain Wordsworth was the kinsman who
                mentored their late brother in his sailor&#8217;s trade.) Yet, while never concealing that
                their trip was as much about domestic affairs and business as pleasure, Dorothy used
                the material at hand to create a first-rate piece of travel writing. She was fond of
                Ullswater because, as she told Lady Beaumont, it had not yet been spoiled by &#8220;fancy
                builders&#8221; and was &#8220;full of visions of things . . . that might have employed our
                fancy happily for hours, if they had not in the next moment been replaced by others
                as beautiful.&#8221;

                And, like many of the age&#8217;s best travel narratives, Dorothy&#8217;s recounts experiencing
                a distinctive region chiefly on foot. Nature walks were of course among the
                Wordsworth siblings&#8217; favorite pastimes, and, true to form, Dorothy managed to cover
                some 75 miles in six days, with only occasional breaks riding her pony (a recent
                gift from her oldest brother, Richard) or cruising in the Luffs&#8217; rowboat. As Dorothy
                would afterward quip, her stamina left both herself and her brother &#8220;boast[ing] of
                [her] wonderful strength.&#8221;

                </p>
            
                <p>If anything, Dorothy&#8217;s delight in the journey increased as it became more ambitious.
                Though confessedly reluctant to embark from Grasmere on a &#8220;damp and gloomy morning,&#8221;
                she reported that &#8220;as the mists thickened&#8221; over Kirkstone Pass, &#8220;[their] enjoyments
                increased.&#8221; On subsequent days&#8212;usually with William and sometimes also with their
                friends&#8212;she explored the lake&#8217;s southeastern shore, hiked over the mountains from
                Martindale to Patterdale, wandered through the Lowther Woods and the familiar
                streets of Penrith, and twice trekked the full length of Ullswater. On the final day
                alone, she and William walked or rode approximately 23 miles, all after 3:00 p.m.
                After coming back across Kirkstone by starlight, she and William arrived at Dove
                Cottage long after Mary and the children had gone to bed.
                </p>
                
                <p>For Dorothy, this had been a genuine holiday, one reminiscent of tramps undertaken in
                earlier years, when she and her brother spent much of their lives walking, talking,
                and planning the future together. It must also have sparked memories of previous
                Ullswater visits, including their famed encounter with the daffodils beside the lake
                in 1802, when William was settling his affairs with Annette Vallon and preparing to
                wed Mary Hutchinson. Grounded, then, in feelings both present and past, <title level="a">Ullswater
                Excursion</title> offers some of Dorothy&#8217;s most luminous writing. Over two centuries later,
                it still lingers in the ear and on the mind&#8217;s eye: &#8220;At such a time and in such a
                place every scattered stone the size of one&#8217;s head becomes a companion&#8221;; &#8220;Place-Fell
                steady and bold as a lion; the whole lake driving onward like a great river&#8221;; &#8220;We
                observed the lemon-coloured leaves of the birches . . . as the wind turned them to
                the sun, sparkle, or rather flash, like diamonds&#8221;; &#8220;The stars in succession took
                their stations on the mountain-tops&#8221;; &#8220;All the cheerfulness of the scene was in the
                sky.&#8221; These passages and others like them await the reader of &#8220;Excursion on the
                Banks of Ullswater,&#8221; which this edition presents with thorough annotations and
                illustrations.

            <p>As noted previously, <title level="a">Excursion on the Banks of Ullswater</title> survives in two
                manuscripts. The first, Dove Cottage Manuscript 51 (DCMS 51) is a hand-sewn notebook containing 
                both prose and verse (fig. 3.3). This notebook preserves various materials related to the Ullswater
                text, including five pages of draft fragments (pp. 1&#8211;5) plus two experimental introductions
                (pp. 18&#8211;20) that helped produce the 1823 <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title>. Its 
                complete copy of the Ullswater narrative (pp. 21&#8211;34) is the earliest known. Like 
                <title level="a">Excursion up Scawfell Pike,</title> it shows multiple sets of revisions, some 
                in pen and some (later) in pencil. The base layer is in Dorothy&#8217;s hand, while edits appear
                in her handwriting but possibly also in William&#8217;s. We ignore the penciled edits in
                our apparatus, seeking so far as possible to emphasize Dorothy&#8217;s own work rather
                than trace the evolution of William&#8217;s <title level="m">Guide</title>. Still, all of
                the edits, along with the separate fragments and draft introductions, are arguably
                important for the reception history of Dorothy&#8217;s writing, and readers can see the
                results of the multistage revision process in our transcription of the 1823 
                <title level="m"><ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.SP-C">Guide</ref></title> text.

                Library and Museum in New York, this 16-page document (MA 1581) appears in Dorothy&#8217;s
                neatest hand (fig. 3.4).

                Editors Owen and Smyser named it the &#8220;Coleorton Manuscript,&#8221; noting that it appeared among the Morgan

                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">The manuscript remained with the Beaumont family until at least 1882&#8211;1883, when Sir George, the 10th baronet,
                    loaned it to William Knight, and probably into the early decades of the twentieth century. When and how it left the family is uncertain, but eventually
                    it came into the possession of <ref target="https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-31085">Benjamin

                and supposing (with De Sélincourt) that it was made for Lady Beaumont, who for much
                of her life resided at Coleorton Hall in Leicestershire. Added support for their
                surmise comes from the manuscript itself, which features, at the top of its first
                page, a descriptive note in another hand: &#8220;a mountainous ramble by D Wordsworth
                sister to <hi rend="underline">the poet</hi>.&#8221; While it is difficult to draw certain
                conclusions based on a 10-word sample, this appears to be the handwriting of Lady
                Beaumont.
                </p>
            
                <p>In this attractive document, Dorothy edits the DCMS 51 text or a closely related
                draft for style and accuracy. Notably, she removes her account (from 11 November,
                day 6) of walking in Penrith at night, seeing old acquaintances, and revisiting
                familiar haunts. Perhaps she considered this tour of sites linked to her adolescence
                too private or just uninteresting for her likely readers.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Newlyn suggests this passage was &#8220;a keepsake for her sister-in-law [MW], to commemorate their shared past&#8221;
                     (215). The two became close when, as an orphaned teenager, DW lived in Penrith with her stern maternal grandparents. At that time, the girls (along 
                     with Mary&#8217;s sister Peggy) would sneak out to walk in the country or visit one another&#8217;s houses (<title level="m">DWB</title>, 17&#8211;18).
                    </note>
                In any case, the Coleorton Manuscript probably best reflects her intentions for a
                manuscript text to be read outside of the immediate family circle.

                <p>In William&#8217;s <title level="m">Guide</title>, <title level="a">Ullswater 
                Excursion</title> gains acceptability for a general audience but loses some of 
                its personality. As De Sélincourt succinctly puts it, &#8220;Dorothy wrote a 
                journal of this tour which her brother afterwards recast and appended to his
                <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title>: few readers will prefer his more
                formal, &#8216;literary&#8217; version to Dorothy&#8217;s.&#8221;
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors"><title level="m">DWB</title>, 196.</note> 
                To be fair, the <title level="m">Guide</title> version is also memorable, adapted
                for its purpose and embellished with a few novel passages. Nonetheless, Dorothy&#8217;s
                original is warmer, more detailed, and generally more engaging. This is true not
                only because of what De Sélincourt calls her &#8220;vivid beauty of feeling and 
                expression&#8221;
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors"><title level="m">DWB</title>, 196.</note>
                    &#8212;most of her best descriptive passages do appear in the <title level="m">Guide</title>, even if slightly altered&#8212;but also 
                    because of the intimacy of her report, which lends it human interest that might actually be out of place in a guidebook.
                </p>
            
                <p>As in the case of <title level="a">Excursion Up Scawfell Pike,</title> the first
                thing one notices in comparing Dorothy&#8217;s manuscript text to the <title 
                level="m">Guide</title>&#8217;s adaptation is that the latter is shorter and less
                personal. All of the individuals are missing: no &#8220;dear Coleridge,&#8221; no
                Luffs, no Hutchinsons, no Thomas Wilkinson. Even the pony is gone, and that seems 
                a shame; the poor beast is an important character, if only for what he reveals about
                Dorothy, whose sympathy toward animals, both wild and domesticated, comes through 
                strongly in the manuscripts.
                </p>
                
            <p>Overall, then, the social nature of this tour becomes obscured in William&#8217;s retelling.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors"> Comparing the two versions in this manner, we make WW accountable for the changes. 
                    However, manuscript evidence somewhat complicates this simple division of responsibility. DCMS 51 shows late-stage edits in 
                    DW&#8217;s hand as well as WW&#8217;s. Given that DW and WW worked on revisions for the 
                    <title level="m">Guide</title> together (though certain new passages are unambiguously his), we should consider the possibility 
                    that edits for publication sometimes represented DW&#8217;s intention.
                </note>
                To be sure, William often adopts the first-person plural, as in &#8220;We left Grasmere
                vale,&#8221; &#8220;We noticed, as we passed,&#8221; and &#8220;The mists gathered as we
                went along&#8221;&#8212;his narrator does not wander lonely as a cloud. Nonetheless, his
                &#8220;we&#8221; remain basically anonymous. His formal &#8220;We were more than contented,
                &#8221; describing the travelers&#8217; wet crossing of the Kirkstone Pass, is far less 
                evocative than Dorothy&#8217;s report of brother and sister cheerfully advancing through 
                the mist, &#8220;as happy Travellers as ever paced side by side on a holiday ramble.&#8221;
                Lamentably, the changes made for the <title level="m">Guide</title>, necessary as they might
                be to preserve privacy, tend to obscure the core relationship that drives the text: the 
                partnership of the siblings, who must hold even more tightly to each other now that brother
                John is gone and the &#8220;set is . . . broken.&#8221;

            </p>
                
            <p>That close partnership helps explain a blunt fact that frequently troubles today&#8217;s readers:
                William published a substantial work by his sister without acknowledging the fact. Even devoted
                Victorian Wordsworthians could find this appropriation odd, as did Knight in his 1889 biography
                of the poet: &#8220;[Wordsworth] concluded [the <title level="m">Guide</title>] by incorporating
                the whole, or nearly the whole, of his sister&#8217;s journal, without any indication to the
                reader of who the real journalist was, or when his work ended, and that of his sister began!&#8221;
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Knight, <title level="m">Life of William Wordsworth</title>, 2:29. A few years later, Knight included WW&#8217;s 
                    <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> in volume 2 of his <title level="m">Prose Works</title> (1896) and duly inserted a footnote to the
                    Ullswater section: &#8220;It was written by his sister Dorothy.&#8212;E<hi rend="smallcaps">D</hi>.&#8221; (106). To his credit, having discovered 
                    the truth about the material&#8217;s authorship, Knight seemed eager to publicize it.
                    </note>
                We feel certain that William did so with her cooperation; &#8220;Wordsworth&#8221; was the family
                brand, and Dorothy regularly did what she could to support it, contributing to her own financial
                security as well as her brother&#8217;s reputation.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Several scholars have written persuasively on the Wordsworths&#8217; shared investment in the family business. See,
                    for instance, Wallace, &#8220;Home at Grasmere Again,&#8221; and Heinzelman, &#8220;Cult of Domesticity.&#8221;
                    </note>
                The result was a substantially coauthored <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title>,
                even if it was not publicly acknowledged as such. With her intimate knowledge of the
                region, her capacity for wonder, and her gift for descriptive language, Dorothy
                contributed significantly to the <title level="m">Guide</title>&#8217;s success. As Mary
                Ellen Bellanca properly observes, &#8220;These considerations make plain that it is well
                past time to discard the notion of Dorothy Wordsworth as an unpublished, or only
                posthumously published, writer.&#8221;

                    </note></p>
            <p>That said, to the extent that we base our edited text on manuscript evidence, the posthumously
                published Dorothy Wordsworth takes precedence in this edition. We offer <title level="a">Ullswater
                Excursion</title> complete with all of its personal, chatty, quotidian, and whimsical elements. 
                By doing so, we privilege Dorothy&#8217;s perspective on the Lake District, acknowledge the terms
                of her appeal to her first readers, and celebrate the qualities that make her travel writing unique.

            <p>After William&#8217;s <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title>, the first significant printing of
                Dorothy&#8217;s <title level="a">Ullswater Excursion</title> appeared in the 1883 issue of the 
                <title level="m">Transactions of the Wordsworth Society</title>.

                    </note>
                At that year&#8217;s gathering of the Society, William Knight announced that a copy of &#8220;a Mountain Ramble
                with the Poet, written by his Sister, in the year 1805&#8221; had come into his possession.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Knight, ed.,<title level="m">Transactions of the Wordsworth Society</title> No. 5 8, Records attached
                     to the Coleorton Papers at the Morgan Library and Museum confirm that Sir George Beaumont (10th Baronet, 1851&#8211;1914) lent a number
                     of Wordsworth-related items to Knight in November 1882 and March 1883. The Ullswater &#8220;ramble&#8221; (Coleorton Manuscript) must 
                     have been among these items.
                    </note>
                Though he lacked the requisite time to share the text at the meeting, he included an abridged version of it in the 
                <title level="m">Transactions</title>, explaining that &#8220;a curious 
                <hi rend="italic">recast</hi> of this Journal-record of his
                sister was published by Wordsworth in an edition of his <title level="m">Guide to
                    the Lakes.</title>&#8221;

                Knight&#8217;s was the first publication of the narrative under Dorothy&#8217;s name,
                approximately 78 years after its composition.
            </p>
                
            <p>Knight mentioned the text again in his 1889 biography of William, noting the poet&#8217;s incorporation of this &#8220;Mountain Ramble&#8221; in the 
            <title level="m">Guide</title> and calling it &#8220;one of the most curious instances of
            the literary &#8216;communism&#8217; between [the siblings].&#8221;
                <note place="foot">Knight, <title level="m">Life of William Wordsworth</title>, 2:29. Knight mistakenly claims the Ullswater 
                    text first appeared in the <title level="m">Guide</title>&#8217;s fifth edition (1835) rather than the fourth (1823)
                </note>
             Then, in 1897, he included his abridgment in his landmark edition of the <title level="m">Journals of Dorothy Wordsworth</title> 
             as <title level="a">Journal of a Mountain Ramble by Dorothy and William Wordsworth, November 7th to 13th, 1805.</title>
                <note place="foot" resp="editors"><title level="m">KJ</title>, 2:153&#8211;160. In <title level="m">Journals</title> 
                (as in <title level="m">Transactions</title>, Knight omitted 13 separate passages, or a
                total of 1,030 words, that appeared in the Coleorton MS,
                acknowledging his abridgments with ellipses in all cases but two. He
                apparently preferred a brisk pace and pure description to what he
                might regard as digressive, personal chitchat.
                </note>
             Note that Knight&#8217;s consistent use of the word <hi rend="italic">ramble</hi> suggests
             that he had discovered the Coleorton Manuscript, which includes that label on its
             first page (see fig. 3.3).
            </p>
            
            <p>Knight&#8217;s edition remained the established text until 1941, when De Sélincourt included a new version in his own 
            <title level="m">Journals of Dorothy Wordsworth</title>.
                <note place="foot"><title level="m">DWJ</title>, 1:413&#8211;22.</note>
            He explained, &#8220;Professor Knight printed an abbreviated version, [but it] is here given complete
            from Dorothy&#8217;s manuscript.&#8221;
                <note place="foot" resp="editors"><title level="m">DWJ</title>, 1:xiv.</note>
            In fact, however, De Sélincourt sometimes followed Knight&#8217;s
            text, even while seeming unaware of the Coleorton Manuscript. It is possible that De
            Sélincourt worked from a third manuscript, now unknown,
                <note place="foot" resp="editors"><title level="m">Prose</title>, 2:367.
                </note>
            but it seems more likely that he drew on DCMS 51 with an
            eye toward Knight. Instead of retaining Knight&#8217;s title (&#8220;A Mountain Ramble&#8221;), he
            privileged that used in the <hi rend="italic">Guide to the Lakes</hi>, &#8220;Excursion on
            the Banks of Ullswater,&#8221; solidifying for twentieth-century readers the formal title
            we also adopt.

                <p>In 1974, Jane Worthington Smyser and W. J. B. Owen undertook
                the most thorough textual analysis to date of <title level="a">Ullswater Excursion</title> in
                their <title level="m">Prose Works of William Wordsworth</title>
                volume 2, Appendix IV, pp. 368&#8211;78). They
                detailed all available manuscript material, including the fragments and false-start
                introductions of DCMS 51, endeavoring to illuminate the textual history of William&#8217;s
                <title level="m">Guide</title>. For tracing textual variants, their work remains
                indispensable. Unfortunately, <title level="m">Prose Works</title> is available only
                at high cost or in research libraries. Our electronic edition incorporates many of
                its findings while adding fresh research, providing manuscript facsimiles and other
                illustrations, and placing Dorothy Wordsworth in the foreground for a broad
                audience.
