            <p>William and Mary returned from Parkhouse by the Patter-<br/> dale road along with M<sup>r</sup> and M<sup>rs</sup> Clarkson, having<br/> made a delightful excursion of three days. They had<br/> engaged that W<sup>m</sup> and I should go to M<sup>r</sup> Luff’s<br/> on Wednesday or Thursday if the weather conti-<br/> nued favorable. It was not very promising on <br/> Wednesday; but, having been fine for so long a time,<br/> we thought that there would not be an entire change<br/> all at once, therefore on a damp and gloomy morn-<br/> ing we set forward, W<sup>m</sup> on foot, and I upon the<br/> pony with W.’s great coat slung over the saddle<br/> crutch and a wallet containing our bundle of<br/> “needments.” As we went along the mists gathered<br/> upon the vallies, and it even <span style="text-decoration:underline">rained</span> all the <br/> way to the head of Patterdale; but there was<br/> never a drop [two illegible deleted words] upon my habit larger<br/> than the smallest pearls upon a Lady’s ring.<br/> The trees of the larger Island upon Rydale<br/> Lake were of the most gorgeous colours, the<br/> whole Island reflected in the water, as I remember<br/> once in particular to have seen it with dear</p>
            <p>[end page 1]</p>
            <p>Coleridge, when either he or William observed that<br/> the rocky shore spotted and streaked with purplish<br/> brown heath and its image in the water together<br/> were like an immense catterpillar, such as when<br/> we were children we used to call <span style="text-decoration:underline">Woolly Boys</span>,<br/> from their hairy coats. I had been a little coward<br/> -ly when we left home, fearing that heavy rains<br/> might detain us at Patterdale; but as the mists<br/> thickened our enjoyment encreased, and my hopes<br/> grew bolder; and when we were at the top of <br/> Kirkstone (though we could not see fifty yards<br/> before us) we were as happy Travellers as ever<br/> paced side by side on a holiday ramble. At<br/> such a time and in such a place every scat-<br/> -tered stone the size of one’s head becomes a com<br/> -panion: there is a fragment of an old wall at<br/> the top of Kirkstone, which, magnified yet ob<br/> -scured as it was by the mist, was scarcely less<br/> interesting to us when we cast our eyes upon it<br/> than the view of a noble monument of anci<br/> -ent grandeur has been — yet this same pile<br/> of stones we had never before observed. When<br/> we had descended considerably the fields of Hartsop<br/> below Brotherswater were first seen, like a Lake <br/> coloured by the reflection of yellow clouds, I </p>
            <p>[end page 2]</p>
            <p>mistook them for the water; but soon after we saw<br/> the Lake itself gleaming faintly with a grey steely<br/> brightness; then appeared the brown oaks, and the<br/> birches of splendid colour, and, when we came still<br/> nearer to the valley, the cottages under their tufts<br/> of trees and the old Hall of Hartsop with its long<br/> irregular front and elegant chimneys. We had<br/> eaten our dinner under the shelter of a Sheep-fold<br/> by the bridge at the foot of the mountain,<br/> having tethered the pony at the entrance, where<br/> it stood without one impatient beating of a<br/> foot — I could not but love it for its meekness,<br/> and indeed I thought we were selfish to enjoy<br/> our meal so heartily while his poor jaws were<br/> tethered by the curb bridle. We reached M<sup>r</sup><br/> Luff’s about two hours before tea-time.</p>
            <p>Thursday Nov<sup>r</sup> 8<sup>th</sup><br/> <span class="indent8">Incessant rain till eleven o’clock,</span><br/> when it became fair, and W<sup>m</sup> and I walked to <br/> Blowick. Luff joined us by the way. The wind<br/> was strong and drove the clouds forward along<br/> the side of the hill above our heads; four or<br/> five goats were bounding among the rocks;<br/> the sheep moved about more quietly or cowered<br/> in their sheltering places — the two storm-stiffened</p>
            <p>[end page 3]</p>
            <p>black Yew Trees on the crag above Luff’s house were<br/> striking objects, close under or seen through the <br/> flying mists. I do not know what to say of<br/> Blowick; for to attempt to <span style="text-decoration:underline">describe</span> the place<br/> would be absurd when you for whom I write have<br/> been there, or may go thither as soon as you like.<br/> When we stood upon the naked Crag upon the Com<br/> -mon overlooking its <sup>x</sup> woods &amp; bush-besprinkled fields,<br/> the Lake, Clouds, and Mists were all in motion to<br/> the sound of sweeping winds — the Church and Cottages<br/> of Patterdale scarcely visible from the brightness<br/> of the thin mist. Looking backwards toward<br/> the Foot of the Water the scene less visionary —<br/> Place Fell steady and bold as a lion — the whole<br/> Lake driving down like a great river — waves <br/> dancing round the small Islands. We walked<br/> to the house; the Owner was salving sheep in<br/> the barn — an appearance of poverty and decay<br/> every where; — he asked us if we wanted to pur :<br/> -chase the estate. We could not but stop fre -<br/> -quently both in going and returning to look at<br/> the exquisite beauty of the woods opposite. The<br/> general colour of the trees was dark brown,<br/> rather that of ripe hazel nuts; but towards</p>

            <p>x N.B. The fields <sup>&amp; woods</sup> belonging to the Farm of Blowick.</p>
            <p>[end page 4]</p>
            <p>the water there were yet beds of green, and, in some of<br/> the hollow places in the highest part of the woods, the<br/> trees were of a yellow colour, and, through the glittering<br/> light, they looked like masses of clouds as you see<br/> them gathered together in the West, and tinged with<br/> the golden light of the sun. After dinner we walk<br/> -ed with M<sup>rs</sup> Luff up the Vale; I had never had an<br/> idea of the extent and width of it in passing thro’<br/> along the road on the other side. We walked along<br/> the path which leads from house to house; two or<br/> three times it took us through some of those copses<br/> or groves that cover every little hillock in the mid<br/> -dle of the lower part of the Vale, making an<br/> intricate and beautiful intermixture of lawn and<br/> woodland. We left William to prolong his walk; and when<br/> he came into the house he told us that he had pitched<br/> upon the spot where he should like to build a house<br/> better than in any other he had <sup>ever</sup> yet seen. M<sup>rs</sup> Luff went<br/> with him by moonlight to view it. The Vale looked<br/> as if it were filled with white light <span style="text-decoration: line-through">when the moon</span><br/> when the moon had climbed up to the middle of the<br/> sky; but long before we could see her face, while all<br/> the eastern hills were a black shade, those on the<br/> opposite side were almost as bright as snow.<br/> M<sup>rs</sup> Luff’s large white Dog lay in the moonshine<br/> upon the round knoll under the old yew tree,<br/> a beautiful and romantic image — the dark</p>
            <p>[end page 5]</p>
            <p>Tree with its dark shadow, and the elegant creature<br/> as fair as a Spirit.</p>
            <p>Friday Nov 9<sup>th</sup><br/> <span class="indent7">It rained till near ten o’clock, but<br/></span> a little after that time, it being likely for a tolera-<br/> -bly fine day, we packed up bread and cold meat, and,<br/> with Luff’s servant to help to row, set forward in the<br/> Boat. As we proceeded the day grew finer — clouds<br/> and sunny gleams on the mountains. In a grand<br/> Bay under Place Fell we saw three Fishermen with<br/> a Boat dragging a net, and rowed up to them.<br/> They had just brought the net ashore, and hun<br/> -dreds of fish were leaping in their prison. They<br/> were all of one kind, what are called Skellies.<br/> After we had left them the Fishermen continu<br/> -ed their work, a picturesque group under the<br/> lofty and bare crags; the whole scene was very<br/> grand, a raven croaking on the mountain above<br/> our heads. — Landed at Sanwick — the man took<br/> the Boat home, and we pursued our journey<br/> towards the village along a beautiful summer<br/> path, at first through a copse by the Lake<br/> side, then through green fields — the Village and<br/> Brook very pretty, shut out from mountains and<br/> Lakes — it reminded me of Somersetshire — Passed<br/> by Harry Hebson’s house — I longed to go in for<br/> the sake of former times. W<sup>m</sup> went up one side</p>
            <p>[end page 6]</p>
            <p>of the Vale and we the other, and he joined us<br/> after having crossed the one-arched bridge above the<br/> Church — a beautiful view of the church with its <br/> “bare ring of mossy wall” and single Yew Tree. At<br/> the last house in the Vale we were kindly<br/> greeted by the Master, who was sitting at the door<br/> salving sheep — he invited us to go in and see a <br/> room lately built by M<sup>r</sup> Hazel for his accommo<br/> -dation at the yearly chace of red Deer in his<br/> Forests at the head of these Dales; the room is fit-<br/> -ted up in the sportsman’s style, with a single cup-<br/> -board for bottles and glasses &amp;c, some strong chairs, and<br/> a large dining-table; and ornamented with the horns <br/> of the stags caught at these Hunts for many years<br/> back, with the length of the last race they ran<br/> recorded under each. We ate our dinner here; the<br/> good woman treated us with excellent butter and new<br/> oat bread, and, after drinking some of M<sup>r</sup> Hazel’s<br/> strong Ale we were well prepared to face the<br/> mountain, which we began to climb almost immedi-<br/> -ately. Martindale divides itself into two dales<br/> at the head. In one of these (that to the left)<br/> there is no house to be seen, nor any building<br/> but a cattle shed on the side of a hill which<br/> is sprinkled over with wood, evidently the remains <br/> of a Forest, formerly a very extensive one. At<br/> the bottom of the other Valley is the house of which<br/> I have spoken, and beyond the enclosures of this man’s</p>
            <p>[end page 7]</p>
            <p>Farm there are no other. A few old trees remain, relicks<br/> of the Forest, a little stream passes in serpentine wind-<br/> -ings through the uncultivated valley, where many Cattle<br/> were feeding — the Cattle of this country are generally<br/> white or light-coloured; but those were mostly dark<br/> brown or black, which made the scene resemble ma-<br/> -ny parts of Scotland. When we sate on the hill-<br/> -side, though we were well contented with the quiet<br/> every-day sounds, the lowing of cattle, bleating of<br/> sheep, and the very gentle murmuring of the valley<br/> stream, yet we could not but think what a grand<br/> effect the sound of the Bugle Horn would have<br/> among these mountains. It is still heard once<br/> a year at the Chace I have spoken of, a day<br/> of festivity for all the Inhabitants of this Dis-<br/> trict except the poor Deer, the most ancient <br/> of them all. The ascent, even to the top of the<br/> mountain, is very easy. When we had accomplish-<br/> -ed it we had some exceedingly fine mountain<br/> views, some of the mountains being resplendent<br/> with sunshine, others partly hidden by clouds. <br/> Ulswater was of a dazzling brightness bordered by<br/> black hills — the plain beyond Penrith smooth<br/> and bright, (or rather <span style="text-decoration:underline">gleamy</span>) as the sea or sea<br/> Sands. Looked into Boar Dale above Sanwick,<br/> deep and bare, a stream winding down it. After<br/> having walked a considerable way on the tops of<br/> the hills, came in view of Glenriddin and the </p>
            <p>[end page 8]</p>
            <p>mountains above Grisdale. Luff then took us aside,<br/> before we had begun to descend, to a small Ruin<br/> which was formerly a Chapel or place of worship<br/> where the Inhabitants of Martindale and Patterdale<br/> were accustomed to meet on Sabbath days. There<br/> are now no traces by which you could discover<br/> that the Building had been different from a com-<br/> -mon sheep-fold; the loose stones, and the few<br/> which yet remain piled up are the same as<br/> those which lie about on the mountain; but<br/> the shape of the building, being oblong, is not<br/> that of a common sheep-fold, and it stands East<br/> and West. Whether it was ever consecrated ground<br/> or not I know not; but the place may be kept<br/> holy in the memory of some now living in Pat-<br/> -terdale; for it was the means of preserving the <br/> life of a poor old man last summer who, hav-<br/> -ing gone up the mountain to gather peats, had<br/> been overtaken by a storm, and could not<br/> find his way down again. He happened to be<br/> near the remains of the old Chapel, and, in <br/> a corner of it, he contrived, by laying turf and<br/> ling and stones from one wall to the other, to<br/> make a shelter from the wind, and there he<br/> lay all night. The Woman who had sent him<br/> on his errand began to grow uneasy towards</p>
            <p>[end page 9]</p>
            <p>night and the neighbours went out to seek him.<br/> At that time the old Man had housed himself in<br/> his nest, and he heard the voices of the men; but<br/> could not make <span style="text-decoration:underline">them</span> hear, the wind being so loud,<br/> and he was afraid to leave the spot least he <br/> should not ^be able to find it again, so he remained<br/>  there all night, and they returned to their homes<br/> giving him up for lost; but the next morning the<br/> same persons discovered him huddled up in the she[l]tered<br/> work. He was, at first, stupefied and unable to move;<br/> but after he had eaten and drunk, and recollected<br/> himself a little, he walked down the mountain, and did<br/> not afterwards seem to have suffered. As we descend,<br/> the Vale of Patterdale appears very simple and grand<br/> with its two heads, Deep-dale, and Brotherswater or Hart<br/> Hartsop. It is remarkable that two pairs of Bro-<br/> -thers should have been drowned in that Lake. There<br/> is a tradition, at least, that it took its name<br/> from two who were drowned there many years<br/> ago, and it is a fact that two others did meet<br/> that melancholy fate about twenty years since. <br/> It was upon a New-year’s Day. Their Mother had<br/> sent them to thresh some corn, and they, probably<br/> thinking it hard to be so tasked when all others<br/> were keeping holiday, stole out to slide upon<br/> the ice and were both drowned. A Neighbour who</p>
            <p>[end page 10]</p>
            <p>who had seen them fall through the ice, though not near<br/> enough to be <span style="text-decoration:underline">certain</span>, guessed who they were, and went<br/> to the mother to enquire after her sons. She replied<br/> that they were in the Barn threshing, “Nay,” said<br/> the Man, they are not there, I am sure, and it<br/> is not likely today.” The Woman went with<br/> him to the Barn and the Boys were gone:<br/> he was then confirmed, and told her that he believ-<br/> -ed that they were drowned. It is said that they<br/> were found locked in each other’s arms. I was<br/> exceedingly tired when we reached home, owing<br/> to the steepness and roughness of the peat track<br/> by which we descended. I lay down on the<br/> Sofa in M<sup>rs</sup> Luff’s parlour and was asleep<br/> in three minutes – – – – –. A fine moonlight<br/> night — a thick fog in the middle of the<br/> Vale, which disheartened William about the<br/> situation of his house. Supped on some of the<br/> Fish caught by the Fishermen at the foot<br/> of Place Fell. We thought them excellent.</p>
            <p>Saturday Novr 10<sup>th</sup><br/> <span class="indent8">A beautiful morning. When<br/></span> we were at breakfast we heard suddenly the tidings<br/> of Lord Nelson’s death, and the Victory of Trafal-<br/> -gar. Went to the Inn to make further inquiries – <br/> I was shocked to hear that there had been great</p>
            <p>[end page 11]</p>
            <p>rejoicings at Penrith. Returned by William’s rock and<br/> grove, and were so much pleased with the spot that<br/> W<sup>m</sup> determined to buy it if possible, therefore we pre-<br/> pared to set off to Park House that W<sup>m</sup> might ap-<br/> -ply to Thomas Wilkinson to negotiate for him<br/> with the owner. We went down that side of the <br/> Lake opposite to Stybarrow Crag: I dismounted,<br/> and we sate some time under the same rock as<br/> before, above Blowick. Owing to the brightness of<br/> the sunshine the Church and other buildings were<br/> even more concealed from us than by the mists<br/> the other day. It had been a sharp frost in the <br/> night, and the grass and trees were yet wet.<br/> We observed the lemon-coloured leaves of the birches<br/> in the wood below, as the wind turned them to the <br/> sun, sparkle, or rather <span style="text-decoration:underline">flash</span>, like diamonds. The <br/> day continued unclouded to the end. We had a de-<br/> -lightful ride and walk, for it was both to both of <br/> us. We led the horse under Place Fell, &amp;, though<br/> I mostly rode when the way was good, William<br/> sometimes mounted to rest himself. Called at<br/> Eusemere. Went by Bower Bank, intending to<br/> ford the Emont at the Mill; but the pony would<br/> not carry us both, so, after many attempts, I rode<br/> over myself and a Girl followed me on another<br/> horse to take back the pony to William. Very cold </p>
            <p>[end page 12]</p>
            <p>before we reached Park House. Derwent ran to meet<br/> us. Sate in the kitchen till the parlour fire was<br/> lighted and then <span style="text-decoration:underline">enjoyed </span>a comfortable dish of tea.<br/> After tea William went to Thomas Wilkinson’s and<br/> to Brougham.</p>
            <p>Monday, November 12<sup>th</sup><br/> <span class="indent10">The morning being fine, we re-<br/></span> -solved to go to Lowther, and accordingly Sara H.<br/> mounted her Brother’s horse, I the pony, and<br/> W<sup>m</sup> and Miss Green set out on foot; but she<br/> had not walked long before she took a seat behind<br/> Sara. Crossed the Ford at Yanworth ––– Found Tho-<br/> -mas Wilkinson at work in one of his fields;<br/> he chearfully laid down the spade and walked<br/> by our side with William. We left our horses at <br/> the Mill below Brougham, and walked through<br/> the woods till we came to the Quarry, where the<br/> road ends, the very place which has been the<br/> Boundary of some of the happiest of the walks<br/> of my youth. The sun did not shine when we were<br/> there; and it was mid-day, therefore if it had shone,<br/> the light could not have been the same; yet so<br/> vividly did I call to mind those walks that<br/> when I was in the wood I almost seemed to see<br/> the same rich light of evening upon the trees<br/> which I had seen in those happy hours. My heart </p>
            <p>[end page 13]</p>
            <p>was full; and I could not but grieve that any stran-<br/> -gers were with us. At this time the Path was scarce<br/> -ly traceable by the eye, all the ground being covered <br/> with withered leaves, which I was very sorry for, W<sup>m</sup><br/> having spoken of the beauty of it with so much de<br/> -light after he had been at Lowther in the summer.<br/> Scrambled along under the Quarry; then came to T.<br/> Wilkinson’s new path. We spent three delightful <br/> hours by the River side and in the woods. Called at<br/> Richard Bowman’s. We had a pleasant ride home;<br/> Sara and I stopped at Red Hills while William<br/> went over the Ford to T. Wilkinson’s. The House<br/> untidy and uncomfortable — a little Girl never<br/> ceased rocking the Baby in the cradle. We asked <br/> if it would not sleep without rocking, and the<br/> Mother said “No, for she was used to it” — Reached<br/> Park House at ten o’clock — Joanna had waited<br/> dinner and tea for us.</p>
            <p>Tuesday, November 13<sup>th</sup><br/> <span class="indent9">A very wet morning — no </span><br/> hope of being able to return home. W<sup>m</sup> read in<br/> a Book lent him by Thomas Wilkinson. I<br/> read Castle Rackrent. The day cleared at<br/> one o’clock and after dinner, at a little before<br/> three we set forward. The pony was bogged in <br/> Tom’s field &amp; I was obliged to dismount — Went <br/> over Soulby Fell. Before we reached Ulswater the </p>[end page 14]
            <p>sun shone, and only a few scattered clouds remained<br/> on the hills except at the tops of the very highest –<br/> the Lake perfectly calm – We had a delightful jour-<br/> -ney. At the beginning of the first Park William<br/> got upon the pony, and, betwixt a walk and a<br/> run, I kept pace with him while he trotted to the<br/> next gate; then I mounted again. We were joined <br/> by two Travellers; like ourselves, with one white horse<br/> between them. We went on in company till we<br/> came near to Patterdale, trotting most of the<br/> time. The Trees in Gowborough Park were very beau-<br/> -tiful, the hawthorns leafless — their round heads cover-<br/> -ed with rich red berries, and adorned with arches of<br/> green brambles, and eglantine hung with glossy hips<br/> — Many birches yet tricked out in full foliage of<br/> bright yellow — Oaks brown or leafless — the smooth<br/> branches of the ashes bare — most of the alders green<br/> as in spring. I think I have more pleasure in look-<br/> -ing at deer than any other animals, perhaps chief-<br/> -ly from their living in a more natural state. At<br/> the end of Gowborough Park, A large Troop of them<br/> were moving slowly, or standing still, among the fern.<br/> I was grieved when our companions startled them with <br/> a whistle, disturbing a beautiful image of grave<br/> simplicity and thoughtful enjoyment; for I could<br/> have fancied that even they were partaking with<br/> me a sensation of the solemnity of the closing day. </p>

            <p>The sun had been set some time, though we could only<br/> just perceive that the daylight was partly gone, and<br/> the Lake was more brilliant than before. I dismount-<br/> -ed again at Stybarrow Crag, and William rode till<br/> we came almost to Glenriddin. Found the Luffs at <br/> tea in the kitchen. After tea set out again; Luff<br/> accompanied me on foot and William continued to<br/> ride till we came to the foot of Brothers-water. <br/> — A delightful evening — the Seven Stars close to<br/> the hill tops in Patterdale — all the stars seemed<br/> brighter than usual. The steeps were reflected in Bro-<br/> -thers-water, and above the Lake appeared like enormous black<br/> perpendicular walls. The torrents of Kirkstone had been<br/> swoln by the rains, and filled the mountain Pass<br/> with their roaring, which added greatly to the solem-<br/> -nity of our walk — the stars in succession took their<br/> stations on the mountain tops. Behind us, when we<br/> had climbed very high we saw one light in the Vale<br/> at a great distance, like a large star, a solitary<br/> one, in the gloomy region — all the cheerfulness of<br/> the scene was in the sky above us. Found Mary &amp;<br/> the children in bed — no fire — luckily William was<br/> warm with walking, and I not cold; having wrap-<br/> -ped myself up most carefully, &amp; the night being mild.</p>
