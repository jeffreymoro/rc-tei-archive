                           to carry both her and WW across the River Eamont. One of DW’s letters to Richard,
                           written a few days after the tour (15 November 1805), explains that the pony has an
                           unfortunate tendency to stumble, prompting her to think she must replace it. This

                           and it is just possible that DW, with tongue in cheek, has Spenser in mind: “A Dwarfe

                  at the top of Kirkstone, which, magnified yet obscured as it was by the mist, was
                  scarcely less interesting to us when we cast our eyes upon it than the view of a noble
                  monument of ancient grandeur has been – yet this same pile of stones we had never
                  before observed. When we had descended considerably the fields of Hartsop below Brotherswater
                  were first seen, like a Lake coloured by the reflection of yellow clouds, I [Page 3]mistook them for the water; but soon after we saw the Lake itself gleaming faintly
                  with a grey steelly brightness; then appeared the brown oaks, and the birches of splendid
                  colour, and, when we came still nearer to the valley, the cottages under their tufts
                  of trees and the old Hall of Hartsop with its long irregular front and elegant chimneys.

                     others did meet that melancholy fate about twenty years since. It was upon a New-year’s
                     Day. Their Mother had sent them to thresh some corn, and they, probably thinking it
                     hard to be so tasked when all others were keeping holiday, stole out to slide upon
                     the ice and were both drowned. A Neighbour [Page 11] who had seen them fall through the ice, though not near enough to be certain, guessed
                     who they were, and went to the mother to inquire after her sons. She replied that
                     they were in the Barn threshing, “Nay,” said the Man, [“]they are not there, I am
                     sure, and it is not likely today.” The Woman went with him to the Barn and the Boys
                     were gone: he was then confirmed, and told her that he believed that they were drowned.
                     It is said that they were found locked in each other’s arms. I was exceedingly tired
                     when we reached home, owing to the steepness and roughness of the peat track by which

                     of the very highest – the Lake perfectly calm – We had a delightful journey. At the

                     in Gowborough Park were very beautiful, the hawthorns leafless – their round heads

                     hung with glossy hips – Many birches yet tricked out in full foliage of bright yellow

                     animals, perhaps chiefly from their living in a more natural state. At the end of

                     day. [Page 16] The sun had been set some time, though we could only just perceive that the daylight
                     was partly gone, and the Lake was more brilliant than before. I dismounted again at

               One of DW’s letters to Richard, written a few days after the tour (15 November 1805),
               explains that the pony has an unfortunate tendency to stumble, prompting her to think
               she must replace it. This she regrets because she enjoys riding and finds that the
