            Dorothy Wordsworth at the request of her Brother,<lb/>

            which had come within her notice; thinking that<lb/>
            the end for which the account was written would<lb/>
            be thereby better answered, viz. that of leaving<lb/>
            behind a record of human sympathies, and<lb/>
            moral sentiments, either as they were called forth<lb/>
            or brought to remembrance, by a distressful<lb/>
            event, which took place, in the course of the month<lb/>
            of March, 1808, at Grasmere in the County of<lb/>

                which was to see her Daughter who was in service there, and to settle with her
                Mistress about her continuing in her place. Accordingly, after having spent a few

                the Fells, and drop down just upon their own Cottage; and they were seen, nearly at
                the top of the hill in their direct course, by some Persons in Langdale

               <add rend="sup">and were never more seen alive.</add> It is supposed that soon
               afterwards they must have been bewildered by a mist, otherwise they might almost
               have reached their own Cottage at the bottom of the hill on the opposite side before
               daylight was entirely gone. They had left a Daughter at home, eleven years of age, with the
                care of five other Children younger than herself, the youngest an Infant at the
                breast; and they, poor Things! sate up till eleven o&#8217;clock expecting their Parents:

                they stayed all night in Langdale because of the weather. All next day they
                continued to expect them, and again went to bed as before; and at noon on Monday,
                one of the Boys went to the nearest house to borrow a Cloak, and, on being asked for
                what purpose, he replied that his Sister was going to Langdale, as he expressed it,
                &#8220;to <hi rend="underline">lait their Folk</hi>,&#8221; meaning to seek their Father and

                and many Men went out upon the hills to search; but in vain: no traces of them could
                be found; nor any tidings heard, except what I have mentioned, and that a Shepherd
                who had been upon the Mountains on Sunday morning had observed indistinct foot-marks
                of two Persons who had walked close together. Those foot-marks were now covered with
                fresh snow: the spot where they had been seen was at the top of Blea Crag above
                Easedale Tarn, that very spot where I myself had sate down <add rend="sup">&lt;three&gt;</add>

                at Stickell Tarn. A mist came on after I had parted with him, and I wandered long,
                not knowing whither. When, at last, the mist cleared away I found myself at the edge
                of the Precipice, and trembled at the Gulph below, which appeared immeasurable.
                Happily I had some hours of daylight before me, and after a laborious walk, <hi rend="strike">I</hi> arrived at home in the evening. The neighbourhood of

                searched above and below, wherever foot could come; yet, recollecting my own
                dreadful situation, I could not help believing that George and Sarah Green were
                lying somewhere thereabouts. On Tuesday</p><pb/>

                as long as daylight lasted the search was continued. It was like a sabbath in the
                Vale: for all the Men who were able to climb the heights had left their usual work,
                nor returned to it till the Bodies of the unfortunate Pair were found, which was on
                Wednesday afternoon. The Woman was first discovered upon some rough ground just
                above the mountain enclosures beside Mill Beck, in Langdale, which is the next
                stream or torrent to that which forms Dungeon Gill Waterfall. Several Persons, the
                day before had been within a few yards of the spot where she lay; but her body had
                then been covered with snow, which was now melted. Her Husband was found at no great
                distance: he had fallen down a Precipice; and must have perished instantly, for his
                Skull was much fractured. It is supposed that his Wife had been by his side when he
                fell, as one of her shoes was left midway on the Bank above the precipice;
                afterwards (probably having stumbled over a crag) she had rolled many yards down the
                breast of the hill. Her body was terribly bruised. It is believed that they <hi rend="strike">must have</hi> perished before midnight, their cries

                thinking <del rend="strike">that</del> they came from some drunken People who had been
                at the Sale. At that time the wretched Pair <add rend="sup">had no doubt</add> resigned
                all hope of reaching their own home, and were attempting to find a shelter any
                where; and, [two illegible deleted words] at the spot where they perished they might have seen
                <del rend="strike">the</del> lights <add rend="sup">from the windows</add> of that same house where their cries
                were actually heard. Soon after the alarm had been spread on Monday afternoon (and
                from that moment all were convinced of the truth; for it was well known that if the
                Mother had been <hi rend="underline">alive</hi> she would have returned to her

                at the opposite side of the dale) went to take care of the poor Children, and they
                found them in a wretched state “all crying together.” They had passed two whole days
                (from Saturday noon till Monday noon) without seeing any body, waiting patiently and
                without fear; and when the word came that their Father and Mother must have died
                upon the hills it was like a thunder- <add rend="sub">-stroke.</add>

            In a little time, however, they were somewhat pacified; and food was brought into the
                house; for their stock was almost exhausted, their Parents being the poorest People
                in the Vale, though they had a small estate of their own, and a Cow. This morsel of
                Land, now deeply mortgaged, had been in the
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors">DCMS 64: &#8220;the&#8221; is crossed out with pencil.</note>
                possession of the Family for many generations, and they were loth to part with it:
                consequently they had never had any assistance from the Parish. George Green had been
                twice married. By his former Wife he has left one Son and three Daughters; 
                and by her who died with him four Sons and four Daughters, all
                under sixteen years of age. They must very soon have parted with their Land if they
                had lived: for their means were reduced by little and little till scarcely anything
                <hi rend="underline">but</hi> the <hi rend="underline">Land</hi> was left. The
                Cow was grown old; and they had not money to buy another; they had sold their horse;
                and were in the habit of carrying any trifles <del rend="strike">that</del>
                they could spare out of house or stable to barter for potatoes or meal
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors">[BL meal = oat-meal]</note>.
                Luxuries they had none they never made tea, and when the Neighbours went to look
                after the Children they found nothing in the house but two boilings of potatoes, a
                very little meal, little bread, and three or four legs of lean dried mutton.

            The Cow, at that time, did not give a quart of milk in the day. You will wonder how
                they lived at all; and indeed I can scarcely tell you. They used to sell a few peats
                in the summer, which they dug out of their own hearts’ heart, their Land; and the
                old Man (he was sixty five years of age) might earn a little <add rend="sup">money</add>
                by doing <del rend="strike">odd</del> jobs for his neighbours; but it was not known till
                now (at least by <hi rend="underline">us</hi>) how much distressed they must have been:
                for they were never heard to murmur or complain. See them when you would, both were
                chearful; and when they went to visit a Friend, or to a Sale they were decently
                dressed. Alas! a love of Sales had always been their failing, being perhaps the only 
                publick meetings in this neighbourhood where social pleasure is to be had without the necessity
                of expending money, except, indeed, our annual Fair, and on that day I can recollect having more
                than once seen Sarah Green among the rest with her chearful countenance_ two or
                three little-ones about her; and their youngest Brother or Sister, an Infant, in her
                arms. These things are now remembered; and the awful event checks all disposition to
                harsh comments; perhaps formerly it might be said,

            and with truth, the Woman had better been at home: but who shall assert that this
                same spirit which led her to come at times among her Neighbours as an equal, like
                them seeking society and pleasure, that this spirit did not assist greatly in
                preserving her <add rend="sup">in</add> chearful independence of mind through the
                many hardships and privations of extreme poverty? &#8212; Her Children, though very
                ragged, were always cleanly, and are as pure and innocent, and in every respect as
                promising Children as any I ever saw. The three or four latest born, it is true,
                look as if they had been checked in their grown for want of full nourishment; but none 
                appear unhealthy except the youngest, a fair and beautiful Infant. It looks sickly, but
                not suffering: there is a heavenly patience in its countenance; and, while it lay asleep
                in its cradle three days after its Mother&#8217;s death, one could not look upon it

                on the floor_ the Infant was asleep; and two of the old Man’s up-grown Daughters
                wept silently while they pursued the business of the house: but several times one of
                them went out to listen at the door_ “Oh!” said they, “the worst for us is yet to
                come! we shall never be at rest till they are brought home; and that will be a
                dreadful moment.” _ Their grief then broke out afresh; and they spoke of a miserable
                time, above twenty years ago, when their own Mother and Brother died of a malignant
                fever_ nobody would come near them, and their Father was forced himself to lay his
                Wife in her coffin. “<hi rend="italic">Surely</hi>,” they often repeated, “this is

            <p>House! and indeed in like manner have I since frequently heard it spoken of by
                Persons less nearly concerned; but who still retain a vivid remembrance of the
                former affliction. It is, when any unusual event happens, affecting to listen to the
                fireside talk in our Cottages; you then find how faithfully the inner histories of
                Families, their lesser and greater cares, their peculiar habits, and ways of life
                are recorded in the breasts of their Fellow-inhabitants of the Vale; much more
                faithfully than it is possible that the lives of those who have moved in higher
                stations, and had numerous Friends in the busy world can be preserved in
                remembrance, even when their doings and sufferings have been watched for the express
                purpose of recording them in written narratives. I heard a Woman, a week ago,
                describe in as lively a manner the sufferings of George Green’s Family, when the
                former two Funerals went out of the house as if
                <hi rend="underline" xml:space="preserve">that </hi>trouble had been the <hi
                    rend="underline">present</hi> trouble. Among other things she related how
                Friends and Acquaintances, as is the custom here, when any one is sick, used to
                carry presents; but, instead of going to comfort the Family with their company and
                conversation, laid their gifts upon a Wall near the house, and watched till they
                were taken away. &lt;pb&gt;</p>

                unable to follow with the rest of the Mourners, and we had led her back to the house
                before she got through the first field; the second fainted by the Grave side; and
                their Brother stood like a Statue of Despair, silent and motionless; the younger
                Girls sobbed aloud. Many tears were shed by persons who had known little of the

                general feeling of sympathy for the helpless condition of the Orphans. After the

                we heard of the loss of her Parents, we determined to keep her till she also is fit
                for service. The eldest, and only remaining Son of George Green by his first Wife
                will maintain one of the Boys and bring him up to his own trade; so that there

                profit can be but very small: but they feel that they get something when the money
                comes, and do not feel exactly what they expend for the Children because they are
                fed out of the common stock. At ten years of age they are removed from their

                years old, and a strong, handsome-featured Boy; but though still the same traces of
                natural sense and good-temper appear, his countenance expresses almost savage

                inquiries. You will not wonder, after what I have said, that we have been anxious to

                leave him. I had the satisfaction of seeing all the five Children hospitably
                welcomed. It had been declared with one voice by the people of the Parish, men and
                women, that the Infant and her Sister Jane should not be parted. The Woman, who was
                to have the care of these two, was from home, and had requested a Neighbour to be in
                the way to receive them when they should come. She has engaged to instruct Jane in
                sewing and reading, being, according to the phrase in this Country “a fine Scholar”.

                relationship you may judge how closely the bonds of family connection are held
                together in these retired vallies. Jane and her Sister took possession of their new
                abode with the most perfect composure: Jane went directly to the fireside, and
                seated herself with the Babe on her knee: it continues to call out “Dad” and “Mam!”
                but seems not to fret for the loss of either: she has transferred all her affections
                to her Sister, and will not leave her for a moment to go to anyone else. This same

                some months ago, when they chanced to meet her in Easedale; at first not knowing who

                as she was tripping over the wooden bridge at the entrance of the Valley; and, when
                she drew nearer, the sweetness of her countenance, her blooming cheeks, her modest,

                and a pink bonnet tyed with a blue ribband, the lively colours harmonizing most
                happily with her blooming complexion. Part of this dress had probably been made up
                of her elder Sister’s cast-off cloaths: for they were accustomed to give to their
                Father’s Family whatever they could spare; often, I believe, more than they could

                at that time think that she was so soon to be called to such important duties; and

                was left by her Parents at the head of the helpless Family, and was as a Mother to
                her Brothers and Sister when they were fatherless and motherless, not knowing of

                which they did not possess. This little Girl I saw, as I have told you, take her
                place in her new home with entire composure: I know not indeed how to find a word
                sufficiently strong to express what I mean: it was a calmness amounting to dignity,
                which gave to every motion a perfect grace. We next went with two Boys in petticoats
                to a neat Farm_house: the Man and his Wife came down the lane a hundred yards to
                meet us, and would have taken the Children by the hand with almost parental
                kindness; but they clung to Miss Knott, the Lady who had fetched them from their
                Father’s Cottage on the day of the Funeral, &amp; had treated them tenderly ever

                with his old Friend. I looked at him, and perceived that his eyes were full of<hi

            <p>31</p>
            <p>aided by the peculiar situation of themselves and their Children. They lived in a

                These Children had no Playfellows but their own Brothers and Sisters; and wayward
                inclinations or uneasy longings, where there was no choice of food or toys, no
                luxuries to contend for, could scarcely exist, they seeing nothing of such feelings
                in their Parents. There was no irregular variety in the earlier part of their
                infancy and childhood, and when they were old enough to be trusted from home they
                rarely went further than their own fields, except to go on errands; so that even
                then they would be governed by the sense of having a duty to perform. No doubt many
                Families are brought up in equal solitude and under the same privations; and we see
                no such consequences; and I am well aware that these causes have often a baneful
                effect if the Parents themselves be vicious; but such very poor People as in their
                situation most resemble these are generally in a state of dependence; and the chain
                which holds them back from dishonesty or any disgraceful conduct is by no means so
                strong. While George and Sarah Green held possession of the little estate inherited
                from their Forefathers they were in a superior station; and thus elevated in their

                feelings than that of those Cottagers who live in solitude and poverty without any

                these very Children (with no Overlooker except when it was necessary for the elder
                to overlook the younger) busied in turning the peats which their Father had dug out

                and bearing away those which were dry (in burthens of three or four) upon their
                shoulders. In this way the Family were bound together by the same cares and
                exertions; and already one of them has proved that she maintained this spirit after
                she had quitted her Father’s Roof. The eldest, Mary, when only fourteen years of

                propriety in her manners which I have seldom seen in one so young; this with great

                anxiety for her Brothers and Sisters. Much, indeed, as I have said of the moral
                causes tending to produce that submissive, gentle, affectionate, and I may add <hi
                    rend="underline">useful</hi> character in these children, I have omitted to
                speak of the foundation of all, their own natural dispositions, or rather their
                constitutional temperament of mind and body. I am convinced from observation that
                there is in the whole Family a peculiar tenderness of Nature; perhaps inherited from
                their Father, whom I have several times heard speak of his own Family in a manner
                that shewed an uncommonly feeling heart; once especially: two or three years ago,
                when his Boy George had scalded himself and was lying dangerously ill, we met him in
                Easedale; and he detained us a full quarter of an hour while he talked of his<hi

                Child’s sufferings and his surpassing patience. I well remember the poor Father’s
                words “He never utters a groan_ never so much as says Oh Dear! but when he sees us
                grieved for him encourages us and often says “Never fear, I warrant you I shall get
                better again.” These circumstances and many more which &lt;pb&gt; </p>

            <p>I do not so distinctly recollect the old Man repeated with tears streaming down his
                cheeks; yet we often saw a smile of pride in his face while he spoke of the Boy’s
                fortitude and undaunted courage. I have said that George Green had been twice
                married, and that his Son and Daughters by the first Wife are in a respectable
                condition of life; but he had not only brought up thus far his own large Family; but
                also two Children, a Son and a Daughter, whom his Wife had borne before marriage. He
                received eighteen pence weekly towards the maintenance of each, and brought them up
                as his own Children. I do not know what Sarah Green’s general conduct before

                probably, a neglected Child, and, having had the merit of conquering her failings,
                she for that cause may perhaps be entitled to a higher praise than would have been
                her due if she had never fallen. Her conduct as a Wife and a Mother <hi

                those who knew them best were willing to lend them a little money to help them out

                because the Child went without ready money the Shopkeeper refused to let them have
                the bread. We, in our connection with them have had one opportunity of remarking

                necessity, and how faithful they were to their word. Our little Sally wanted two
                shifts: we sent to desire her Mother to procure them; the Father went the very next
                day to Ambleside to buy the cloth, and promised to pay for it in three weeks. The
                shifts were sent to Sally without a word of the difficulty of procuring them, or
                anything like a complaint. After her Parent’s death we were very sorry (knowing now
                so much of their extreme poverty) that we had required this of them, and on asking

                to discharge that debt) we were told by one of the Daughters that she had been to
                the Shop purposely to make the enquiry, and found that, two or three days before the

                With her many cares and fears for her helpless Family she must, at that time, have

                who refused to go by that way on account of the bad weather, and she laughed at them
                for being cowardly. It is now said that her Husband was always fond of doing things

                said to her, “What you cannot stop in such a poor House!” The Daughter after this

            <p>I ought to have mentioned that George Green’s debts, save the Mortgage on his Estate,
                were very small and few in number. The household goods sold for their full worth,
                perhaps more_The Cupboard <hi rend="strikethrough">of</hi> which I have mentioned
                was bought for fourteen shillings and sixpence_ an oaken Chest for twenty four
                shillings, and their only Feather Bed for three pounds. The Cow sold for but twenty
                four shillings, and I believe that was its full value. These articles which I have
                mentioned were the most valuable of their moveable possessions. <hi rend="underline"

                after having drunk tea with her Mistress. The Girl did not hear of the melancholy
                event till Monday Evening, and she was with difficulty kept from going herself over
                the Mountains, though night was coming on. In her distraction she thought that <hi

                she might be suffered to go in one of the Boats for though others could not find
                him_ she said “Do let <hi rend="underline">me</hi> go I am sure I can spy him!” I

            <p>shall forget the agony on her face_ without a tear. She looked eagerly towards the
                Island near the Shore of which her Son had been lost, and wringing her hands, said,
                while I was standing close to her, “I was fifty years old when I bore him, &amp; he

                sorrow till now.” The death of this young Man, William Watson, caused universal
                regret in the Vale of Grasmere. He was drowned on a fine summer’s Sunday afternoon
                having gone out in a Boat with some Companions to bathe. His Body was not found till
                the following morning though the spot where he had sunk was exactly known. All
