                <title level="a"> Ullswater Excursion</title> plus fragments and draft introductions for the Ullswater text published in William’s 
                <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> (1823).
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">The fragmentary draft materials—not included in our edition—appear on pp. 1–5 of the notebook. Owen and 
                    Smyser account for them in the apparatus of <title level="m">Prose</title>, 2:368–78.</note>
                Here, we transcribe Dorothy’s complete version, headed <title level="a">November 1805.</title> To the extent possible, we represent exactly 
                what appears on the notebook’s pages; however, we ignore marks in pencil, which belong to a later date and serve to shape the text for publication. 
                In doing so, we prefer so far as possible Dorothy’s “original” text to the adapted version prepared for William’s <title level="m">Guide</title>. 
                For ease in comparing the transcription to the manuscript, we maintain the notebook’s lineation; however, long insertions sometimes cause lines 
                to spill over. Unusually difficult passages are discussed in the notes.]

                                that the whole revised sentence would read as follows: “Two storm-stiffened black yew trees on the
