                <title level="a"> Ullswater Excursion</title> plus fragments and draft introductions for the Ullswater text published in William&#8217;s 
                <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> (1823).
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">The fragmentary draft materials—not included in our edition—appear on pp. 1–5 of the notebook. Owen and 
                    Smyser account for them in the apparatus of <title level="m">Prose</title>, 2:368–78.</note>
                Here, we transcribe Dorothy&#8217;s complete version, headed <title level="a">November 1805.</title> To the extent possible, we represent exactly 
                what appears on the notebook&#8217;s pages; however, we ignore marks in pencil, which belong to a later date and serve to shape the text for publication. 
                In doing so, we prefer so far as possible Dorothy&#8217;s &#8220;original&#8221; text to the adapted version prepared for William&#8217;s <title level="m">Guide</title>. 
                For ease in comparing the transcription to the manuscript, we maintain the notebook&#8217;s lineation; however, long insertions sometimes cause lines 
                to spill over. Unusually difficult passages are discussed in the notes.]

                    <l>day. The sun had been set some time but as the Lake <hi rend="strikethrough">though</hi> <hi rend="overbar">and</hi> 
                        <hi rend="strikethrough">we</hi> could <hi rend="strikethrough">only</hi>
                    </l>
                    <l>just perceive that the day-light was fading away from</l>
                    <l>the hills, <hi rend="strikethrough">and</hi> <hi rend="overbar">but</hi> the lake <hi rend="overbar">[Under a luminous sky]</hi>
                        was more brilliant than before.
                    </l>
                    <l>I dismounted again at Stybarrow Crag &amp; William rode</l>
                    <l>till we came almost to Glenridden. Found the Luffs</l>
                    <l>at Tea in the kitchen. After Tea <hi rend="overbar">at Patterdale</hi> set out again. Luff</l>
                    <l>accompanied me on foot unto the lane, &amp; W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi> continued</l>
                    <l>to ride till we came to Brothers-water Bridge – a </l>
                    <l>delightful evening. The Seven Stars close to the hill</l>
                    <l>tops in Patterdale – All the stars seemed brighter than</l>
                    <l>usual. The steeps were reflected in Brother&#8217;s water; and</l>
                    <l>above the Lake appeared like enormous black perpen-</l>
                    <l>dicular walls. The torrents of Kirkstone had been swoln</l>
                    <l>by the rains, &amp; filled the mountain Pass with their </l>
                    <l>roaring, which added greatly to the solemnity of our</l>
                    <l>walk. Behind us, when we had climbed very high, we</l>
                    <l>saw one light in the Vale at a great distance, like</l>
                    <l>a large <hi rend="overbar">red</hi> star, a solitary one, in the gloomy region - all</l>
                    <l>the chearfulness of the scene was <hi rend="overbar">transferred</hi> in the sky above us.</l>
                    <l>Found Mary &amp; the Children in bed – no fire – luckily</l>
                    <l>W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi> was warm with walking, &amp; I not cold, having wrap-</l>
                    <l>ped myself up most carefully, &amp; the night being <hi rend="strikethrough">mild</hi></l>
                    <l>mild – Went to bed immediately after Supper. </l>
