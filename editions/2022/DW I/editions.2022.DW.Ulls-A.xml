                <title level="a"> Ullswater Excursion</title> plus fragments and draft introductions for the Ullswater text published in William&#8217;s 
                <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> (1823).
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">The fragmentary draft materials—not included in our edition—appear on pp. 1–5 of the notebook. Owen and 
                    Smyser account for them in the apparatus of <title level="m">Prose</title>, 2:368–78.
                    </note>
                Here, we transcribe Dorothy&#8217;s complete version, headed <title level="a">November 1805.</title> To the extent possible, we represent exactly 
                what appears on the notebook&#8217;s pages; however, we ignore marks in pencil, which belong to a later date and serve to shape the text for publication. 
                In doing so, we prefer so far as possible Dorothy&#8217;s &#8220;original&#8221; text to the adapted version prepared for 
                William&#8217;s <title level="m">Guide</title>. For ease in comparing the transcription to the manuscript, we maintain the 
                notebook&#8217;s lineation; however, long insertions sometimes cause lines to spill over. Unusually difficult passages are discussed in the notes.]

                a time, and in such a place every scattered stone the size<lb/>

                 Luff&#8217;s house were striking objects close under, or seen through<lb/>
                 the flying mists. I do not know what to say of Blowick; for<lb/>

                 as soon as you like. When we stood under the naked Crag<lb/>

                 to the sound of sweeping winds, the Church &amp; Cottages of<lb/>
                 Patterdale scarcely visible from the brightness of the mist.<lb/>
                 Looking <del rend="strike">backwards towards the foot of</del> <hi rend="overbar">down</hi> the Lake,

                 round the small islands. We walked to the house; the<lb/>
                 Owner was salving sheep in the Barn – an appearance of<lb/>

                 ly, both in going &amp; returning, to observe the exquisite<lb/>
                 beauty of the woods on the opposite side of the Lake.<lb/>
                 The general color of the trees was brown, rather that of<lb/>
                 ripe hazle nuts; but towards the water there were yet<lb/>
                 beds of green; and in some of the hollow places in the<lb/>
                 highest parts of the woods the trees were of a yellow<lb/>
                 colour, and, through the glittering light, they looked like<lb/>
                 masses of clouds, as you see them gathered together in<lb/>

                 Ruin, which was formerly a Chapel, or place of worship,<lb/>

                 accustomed to meet on Sabbath days. There are now<lb/>

                 East &amp; West. Whether it was ever consecrated ground<lb/>

                 holy in the memory of some now living in Patter-<lb/>
                 dale; for it was the means of preserving the<lb/>
                 life of a poor old Man last summer who, having gone up<lb/>
                 the mountain to gather peats together, had been overtaken<lb/>
                 by a storm, and could not find his way down again.<lb/>
                 He happened to be near the remains of the old Chapel<lb/>

                <p>and stones in a corner of it from one wall to the other, to make<lb/>
                a shelter from the wind, and there he sate all night.<lb/>
                The Woman who had sent him on his errand began to<lb/>
                grow uneasy towards evening, &amp; the Neighbours went to<lb/>
                seek him. At that time the old Man had housed himself<lb/>
                in his nest, &amp; he heard the voices of the men; but could not<lb/>
                make himself heard, the wind being so loud; &amp; he was afraid<lb/>
                to leave the spot, least he should not be able to find it<lb/>
                again, so he remained there all night, and they return-<lb/>
                ed to their homes, giving him up for lost; but the next<lb/>
                morning the same persons discovered him, huddled up in<lb/>
                the sheltered nook. He was at first stupefied, &amp; unable<lb/>
                to move, yet after he had eaten and drunk, &amp; recollected<lb/>
                himself a little he walked down the Mountain, and his<lb/>
                health did not afterwards seem to have suffered. As we<lb/>
                descend the Vale of Patterdale appears very simple<lb/>
                and grand with its two heads, Deep dale, &amp; Brothers-water<lb/>
                or Hartsop. It is remarkable that two pairs of Brothers<lb/>
                should have been drowned in that Lake. There is a traditi-<lb/>
                on, at least, that <del rend="strike">two were drowned there</del> it took its<lb/>
                name from two who were drowned there many years<lb/>
                ago; and it is a fact that two others did meet that<lb/>
                melancholy fate about twenty years since. It was after<lb/>
                a New-year&#8217;s-day. Their Mother had sent them to thresh<lb/>
                some corn, and they (probably thinking it hard to be so <lb/>
                tasked when all others were keeping holiday) stole out<lb/>
                to slide upon the ice, and were both drowned. A neighbour<lb/>

                 <p>who had seen them fall through the ice, though not near<lb/>

                 to enquire after her Sons. She replied that &#8220;they were threshing<lb/>
                 in the Barn.&#8221; &#8220;Nay,&#8221; said the Man, &#8220;they are not there, nor is<lb/>
                 it likely today.&#8221; The Woman went with him to the Barn,<lb/>
                 and the Boys were gone. He was then convinced of the truth,<lb/>
                 and told her that they were drowned. It is said that they<lb/>
                 were found locked in each other&#8217;s arms. I was exceedingly<lb/>
                 tired when we reached M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Luff&#8217;s house, owing to the<lb/>
                 steepness and roughness of the peat track down which<lb/>
                 we descended. I lay down on the Sofa, &amp; was asleep in<lb/>

                the Ford at Yanworth. We found Thomas Wilkinson at work<lb/>
                in one of his fields: he chearfully laid down his spade, &amp;<lb/>

                till we came to the [illegible cancel] Quarry where the road ends, the<lb/>
                very place which has been the Boundary of some of the hap-<lb/>

                shone, the light could not have been the same; yet so vivid<lb/>
                -ly did I call to mind those walks, that when I was in the <lb/>
                wood I almost seemed to see the same rich light of<lb/>
                evening upon the trees which I had seen in those happy<lb/>
