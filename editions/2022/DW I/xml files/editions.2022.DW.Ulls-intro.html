                  <p>On 6 November 1805, just as mild weather gave way to autumn rain, Dorothy and William
                     Wordsworth set out to see their friends Charles and Letitia Luff in Patterdale, 12
                     miles northeast of Grasmere on the southern tip of Ullswater.

                              often happens in her journals, she mistakes the dates. As noted, she and WW left Grasmere
                              on Wednesday, 6 November (not on 7 November, as stated in her manuscripts) and returned
                              on the night of Tuesday, 12 November. Therefore, when DW mentions a date, readers
                              should simply subtract one, though she is accurate in identifying the days of the
                              week. </span></div>

                              in this case, given that DW was not for the most part exploring new territory. She
                              had been to Ullswater many times, so the novelty of the trip had mainly to do with
                              circumstances. Still, she and WW wished to visit “some of the vales tributary to Ullswater,
                              where [they had] never been before” (Letters, 1:637).</span></div>
                     </div> It belongs to the Dove Cottage period, when Dorothy also produced her <em>Grasmere Journals</em> (1800–1803) and <em>Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland, A.D. 1803</em>. In fact, 
                     “Ullswater Excursion”
                      was composed at roughly the same time as <em>Recollections</em>,

                              DW completed her first clean copy of the text on 31 May 1805, and the earliest surviving
                              manuscript is a copy made at Patterdale by DW’s friend Catherine Clarkson on 1 November
                              1805, less than a week before the author’s Ullswater tour. For details, see DWJ, 1.viii–xiv.</span></div>

                              writing,” she wrote to Catherine Clarkson in late 1803, “not a Journal, for we took
                              no notes, but recollections of our Tour in the form of a Journal” (Letters 1:421).
                              In truth, DW did make a few hasty notes in Scotland, but she wished she had written
                              more (see Carol Kyros Walker’s editorial introduction to Recollections, 20).</span></div>
                     </div> As Ernest de Sélincourt explained, her Scottish journal was “written at leisure after
                     her return, while the events recorded were still vivid in her memory, and when she
                     could see the whole tour in something of artistic perspective”; the same seems to
                     be true of the Ullswater text.

                     Grasmere to draft the full narrative.

                              letters to Catherine Clarkson and Lady Beaumont at the end of November (see Letters,
                              1:646–47, 648–52), she likely had not yet completed her complete account by then.
                              Her late-November letters also indicate that she had been ill and quite busy, probably
                              without much leisure to write. Possibly she finished drafting the narrative in December
                              1805 or January 1806.</span></div>

                  <p>Why she wrote this account, and for whom, is not altogether clear. As the <em>Grasmere Journals</em> (1800–1803) demonstrate, personal and shared memories routinely jostled together in
                     her notebooks, and she often recorded experiences as potential sources for her own
                     future writing or for William’s. In 
                     “Ullswater Excursion,”
                      she records joyful moments with her brother, yet she clearly has an external audience
                     in mind. She remarks in her report on day 2, “To attempt to <span style="font-style:italic">describe</span> the place would be absurd when you for whom I write have been there, or may go thither
                     as soon as you like.” Thus, her first intended reader (or readers) must have lived
                     in or near the Lake District or had the means to visit easily. She might have said,
                     as she later did concerning her Scottish tour, “I wrote my journal, or rather <span style="font-style:italic">recollections</span> for the sake of my Friends who it seemed ought to have been with us, but were confined
                     at home by other duties.”

                     circumstantial account of her adventure. She and her husband, Sir George, were generous
                     patrons as well as friends to the Wordsworths, so Dorothy was understandably eager

                     somewhat messier, while the second—a fair copy likely prepared for Lady Beaumont—removes
                     some details while offering clarifications and stylistic adjustments. Regrettably,
                     we know little about the manuscripts’ use or possible circulation. Our primary clues
                     about their reception are the simple facts already related: one copy was carefully
                     preserved by the Beaumonts, and the other, retained by Dorothy herself, remained significant
                     in Wordsworth family memory. William thought highly enough of it to make it part of
                     his Lakeland guidebook, and, years later, nephew Christopher mentioned it in his 1851 <em>Memoirs of William Wordsworth</em>, acknowledging the authorship of his aunt.

                  <p>Dorothy composed 
                     “Ullswater Excursion”
                      at a time distinguished by creative accomplishment but also by personal and family
                     worries. She left a good deal unsaid. For instance, when she reports that “Derwent
                     ran to meet us,” informed readers should picture a five-year-old who has not seen
                     his father for almost two years, eager to embrace some of the most important adults
                     in his life. The missing father, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, appears by name at only
                     one point, yet his perplexing absence hangs in the air. Then, to acknowledge another
                     powerful absence, when Dorothy describes coming in view of “the mountains above Grisedale,”
                     ostensibly making the plainest sort of topographical reference, she unavoidably has
                     in mind her beloved brother John—Captain John Wordsworth, who died in a shipwreck
                     in February. It was near Grisedale Tarn that she and William parted with him after
                     his last visit to Grasmere, bidding farewell as he rushed down the Ullswater side
                     of the mountains, full of hope about his coming voyage on the <span style="font-style:italic">Earl of Abergavenny</span>. It was there, too, that William had found a vent for his feelings in early June,
                     composing an elegy through tears.

                      for all its frankness, actually seems reticent. Most of its emotional iceberg remains
                     underwater. Then again, Dorothy apparently had no need to explain such personal contexts
                     to her first readers. Perhaps an implicit understanding of circumstances was part
                     of what she had in mind when she wrote to Lady Beaumont on 29 November, “To make [our
                     daily goings-on and my own peculiar feelings] interesting love must be in your heart.”

                  (1822) and fourth (1823) editions of William’s <em>Guide to the Lakes</em>. Though written some 13 years apart, these texts were forever linked by being placed
                  alongside each other (and similarly transformed) in all editions or reprintings of
                  the <em>Guide</em> from 1823 forward (see fig. 3.2).</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>On one level, the Wordsworth siblings’ journey to Ullswater was a house-hunting trip.
                     Fond as they were of Dove Cottage, it was becoming too small for the growing family
                     and its regular house guests, especially in the wintertime, when everyone spent more
                     time indoors. In November 1805, William and Mary had two children under the age of
                     three and were expecting their third.

                     </div> Moreover, they longed to become homeowners, as evidenced in numerous letters from
                     this period contemplating possible locations and building projects. An early highlight
                     of the trip to Ullswater, then, was inspecting Broad How, an attractive lot for sale
                     near the Luffs’ home in Patterdale. Almost immediately, as Dorothy’s account chronicles,
                     they began imagining a dream home there, and to that end William visited their friend
                     Thomas Wilkinson to ask for help negotiating the purchase of this property.

                              fancies could not resist the temptation &amp; we fixed upon a spot for a cottage which
                              we began to build &amp; finished as easily as castles are raised in the air.” </span></div>
                     </div> Ultimately, with the help of Lord Lowther, William did purchase it in 1806. He held
                     on to this plot for nearly 30 years but never did remodel the old home that stood
                     there or build a new one.

                     in his sailor’s trade.) Yet, while never concealing that their trip was as much about
                     domestic affairs and business as pleasure, Dorothy used the material at hand to create
                     a first-rate piece of travel writing. She was fond of Ullswater because, as she told
                     Lady Beaumont, it had not yet been spoiled by “fancy builders” and was “full of visions
                     of things . . . that might have employed our fancy happily for hours, if they had
                     not in the next moment been replaced by others as beautiful.”

                     </div> And, like many of the age’s best travel narratives, Dorothy’s recounts experiencing
                     a distinctive region chiefly on foot. Nature walks were of course among the Wordsworth
                     siblings’ favorite pastimes, and, true to form, Dorothy managed to cover some 75 miles
                     in six days, with only occasional breaks riding her pony (a recent gift from her oldest
                     brother, Richard) or cruising in the Luffs’ rowboat. As Dorothy would afterward quip,
                     her stamina left both herself and her brother “boast[ing] of [her] wonderful strength.” 
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note25" id="Note25_return"><sup class="super">

               </div>
               <p>If anything, Dorothy’s delight in the journey increased as it became more ambitious.
                  Though confessedly reluctant to embark from Grasmere on a “damp and gloomy morning,”
                  she reported that “as the mists thickened” over Kirkstone Pass, “[their] enjoyments
                  increased.” On subsequent days—usually with William and sometimes also with their
                  friends—she explored the lake’s southeastern shore, hiked over the mountains from
                  Martindale to Patterdale, wandered through the Lowther Woods and the familiar streets
                  of Penrith, and twice trekked the full length of Ullswater. On the final day alone,
                  she and William walked or rode approximately 23 miles, all after 3:00 p.m. After coming
                  back across Kirkstone by starlight, she and William arrived at Dove Cottage long after
                  Mary and the children had gone to bed. </p>
               <p>For Dorothy, this had been a genuine holiday, one reminiscent of tramps undertaken
                  in earlier years, when she and her brother spent much of their lives walking, talking,
                  and planning the future together. It must also have sparked memories of previous Ullswater
                  visits, including their famed encounter with the daffodils beside the lake in 1802,
                  when William was settling his affairs with Annette Vallon and preparing to wed Mary
                  Hutchinson. Grounded, then, in feelings both present and past, 
                  “Ullswater Excursion”
                  offers some of Dorothy’s most luminous writing. Over two centuries later, it still
                  lingers in the ear and on the mind’s eye: “At such a time and in such a place every
                  scattered stone the size of one’s head becomes a companion”; “Place-Fell steady and
                  bold as a lion; the whole lake driving onward like a great river”; “We observed the
                  lemon-coloured leaves of the birches . . . as the wind turned them to the sun, sparkle,
                  or rather flash, like diamonds”; “The stars in succession took their stations on the
                  mountain-tops”; “All the cheerfulness of the scene was in the sky.” These passages
                  and others like them await the reader of “Excursion on the Banks of Ullswater,” which
                  this edition presents with thorough annotations and illustrations.</p>

               <p>As noted previously, 
                  “Excursion on the Banks of Ullswater”
                  survives in two manuscripts. The first, Dove Cottage Manuscript 51 (DCMS 51) is a
                  hand-sewn notebook containing both prose and verse (fig. 3.3). This notebook preserves
                  various materials related to the Ullswater text, including five pages of draft fragments
                  (pp. 1–5) plus two experimental introductions (pp. 18–20) that helped produce the
                  1823 <em>Guide to the Lakes</em>. Its complete copy of the Ullswater narrative (pp. 21–34) is the earliest known.
                  Like 
                  “Excursion up Scawfell Pike,”
                  it shows multiple sets of revisions, some in pen and some (later) in pencil. The base
                  layer is in Dorothy’s hand, while edits appear in her handwriting but possibly also
                  in William’s. We ignore the penciled edits in our apparatus, seeking so far as possible
                  to emphasize Dorothy’s own work rather than trace the evolution of William’s <em>Guide</em>. Still, all of the edits, along with the separate fragments and draft introductions,
                  are arguably important for the reception history of Dorothy’s writing, and readers
                  can see the results of the multistage revision process in our transcription of the
                  1823 <em><a class="link_ref" href="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.SP-C.html">Guide</a></em> text.</p>

                              decades of the twentieth century. When and how it left the family is uncertain, but
                              eventually it came into the possession of Benjamin Ifor Evans, who sold it to the

                     descriptive note in another hand: “a mountainous ramble by D Wordsworth sister to <span style="text-decoration:underline">the poet</span>.” While it is difficult to draw certain conclusions based on a 10-word sample, this

                     of walking in Penrith at night, seeing old acquaintances, and revisiting familiar
                     haunts. Perhaps she considered this tour of sites linked to her adolescence too private
                     or just uninteresting for her likely readers.

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In William’s <em>Guide</em>, 
                     “Ullswater Excursion”
                      gains acceptability for a general audience but loses some of its personality. As De
                     Sélincourt succinctly puts it, “Dorothy wrote a journal of this tour which her brother
                     afterwards recast and appended to his <em>Guide to the Lakes</em>: few readers will prefer his more formal, ‘literary’ version to Dorothy’s.”

                     </div> To be fair, the <em>Guide</em> version is also memorable, adapted for its purpose and embellished with a few novel
                     passages. Nonetheless, Dorothy’s original is warmer, more detailed, and generally
                     more engaging. This is true not only because of what De Sélincourt calls her “vivid
                     beauty of feeling and expression”

                     </div> —most of her best descriptive passages do appear in the <em>Guide</em>, even if slightly altered—but also because of the intimacy of her report, which lends
                     it human interest that might actually be out of place in a guidebook.</p>
               </div>
               <p>As in the case of 
                  “Excursion Up Scawfell Pike,”
                  the first thing one notices in comparing Dorothy’s manuscript text to the <em>Guide</em>’s adaptation is that the latter is shorter and less personal. All of the individuals
                  are missing: no “dear Coleridge,” no Luffs, no Hutchinsons, no Thomas Wilkinson. Even
                  the pony is gone, and that seems a shame; the poor beast is an important character,
                  if only for what he reveals about Dorothy, whose sympathy toward animals, both wild
                  and domesticated, comes through strongly in the manuscripts.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Overall, then, the social nature of this tour becomes obscured in William’s retelling.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Comparing the two versions in this manner, we make WW accountable for the changes.
                              However, manuscript evidence somewhat complicates this simple division of responsibility.
                              DCMS 51 shows late-stage edits in DW’s hand as well as WW’s. Given that DW and WW
                              worked on revisions for the Guide together (though certain new passages are unambiguously
                              his), we should consider the possibility that edits for publication sometimes represented
                              DW’s intention.</span></div>
                     </div> To be sure, William often adopts the first-person plural, as in “We left Grasmere
                     vale,” “We noticed, as we passed,” and “The mists gathered as we went along”—his narrator
                     does not wander lonely as a cloud. Nonetheless, his “we” remain basically anonymous.
                     His formal “We were more than contented, ” describing the travelers’ wet crossing
                     of the Kirkstone Pass, is far less evocative than Dorothy’s report of brother and
                     sister cheerfully advancing through the mist, “as happy Travellers as ever paced side
                     by side on a holiday ramble.” Lamentably, the changes made for the <em>Guide</em>, necessary as they might be to preserve privacy, tend to obscure the core relationship
                     that drives the text: the partnership of the siblings, who must hold even more tightly
                     to each other now that brother John is gone and the “set is . . . broken.”

                     readers: William published a substantial work by his sister without acknowledging
                     the fact. Even devoted Victorian Wordsworthians could find this appropriation odd,
                     as did Knight in his 1889 biography of the poet: “[Wordsworth] concluded [the <em>Guide</em>] by incorporating the whole, or nearly the whole, of his sister’s journal, without
                     any indication to the reader of who the real journalist was, or when his work ended,
                     and that of his sister began!”

                              to the Ullswater section: “It was written by his sister Dorothy.—ED.” (106). To his

                     brand, and Dorothy regularly did what she could to support it, contributing to her

                     contributed significantly to the <em>Guide</em>’s success. As Mary Ellen Bellanca properly observes, “These considerations make plain
                     that it is well past time to discard the notion of Dorothy Wordsworth as an unpublished,

               on the night of Tuesday, 12 November. Therefore, when DW mentions a date, readers
               should simply subtract one, though she is accurate in identifying the days of the

               Her late-November letters also indicate that she had been ill and quite busy, probably
               without much leisure to write. Possibly she finished drafting the narrative in December

               However, manuscript evidence somewhat complicates this simple division of responsibility.
               DCMS 51 shows late-stage edits in DW’s hand as well as WW’s. Given that DW and WW
               worked on revisions for the <em>Guide</em> together (though certain new passages are unambiguously his), we should consider
               the possibility that edits for publication sometimes represented DW’s intention.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note31_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
