                brother, with whom she had shared a home since 1795. In his mid-fifties, WW&#8217;s
                literary reputation and audience were still steadily expanding, and he continued to
                write new poems and rework old ones, including the revisions to 
                <title level="m">The Excursion</title> chronicled in Notebook 1.

                        </note> 
                Although chronic eye pain often made it
                difficult for him to read and DW remarked in 1825 that he was &#8220;much thinner than he
                used to be, and this makes him look old,&#8221; the poet generally remained as hale and
                hearty as his sister.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors"><title level="m">Letters</title>, 4:332.</note> 
                Beyond his literary
                commitments, WW devoted considerable energy during this period to his duties as
                Distributor of Stamps for Westmorland and his extensive engagement with local and
                national politics.

                age 55):</hi> WW&#8217;s wife,
                who before meeting her husband had been DW&#8217;s friend when they were teenagers in
                Penrith. Like the other adults in her household, MW was increasingly prone to
                wanderlust as her children came of age, and for much of the 1820s she, DW, and SH
                essentially alternated being on duty at RM while the others traveled. With it being
                DW&#8217;s turn to stay at home in 1825, MW spent most of that summer and fall with
                friends and family at Kents Bank on the Cartmel Peninsula, Harrogate spa in
                Yorkshire, and Coleorton Hall in Leicestershire. Accordingly, she appears less
                frequently in Notebook 1 than in many subsequent sections of the

                dutiful son and kindhearted brother and nephew. Any expectations that he would
                follow his father&#8217;s and uncle Christopher&#8217;s path to Cambridge were foiled by John&#8217;s
                struggles with mathematics, a subject emphasized more heavily there than at other
                universities. Accordingly, in 1823, WW used family connections to secure his son&#8217;s
                admission to New College, Oxford.

                While John was still
                enrolled, his parents kept him at home for much of 1825 owing to a reported typhus
                outbreak at Oxford. This left him largely carefree, and DW&#8217;s journal suggests he
                spent much of his time both with old friends and with Fanny Barlow, a pretty young
                heiress who arrived in the area in early 1825.

                After spending part of 1823&#8211;24
                working in Ambleside as a teacher at the Dowlings&#8217; school, Dora moved back to RM,
                where, when healthy, she helped her mother and aunts with household chores and her
                father compose letters and copy poems. For much of the decade covered by the 
                <title level="m">RJ</title>, her chronic illnesses dominated the family&#8217;s domestic
                routines and travel schedules. In the summer of 1825, for instance, the Wordsworths
                spent two months at a rental home at Kents Bank on Morecambe Bay largely for her
                health. In the short term, the rest and sea air appear to have helped, as during
                this vacation a revitalized Dora formed the most intense attachment of her young
                life with the family&#8217;s new friend Jane Jewsbury.

                        frank, exuberant, and ardent correspondence in the months that

                And, still rejuvenated after returning to RM, she
                caught the eye of Lt. Tom Robinson, a distant cousin spending his shore leave at his
                brother&#8217;s home in Ambleside. In general, DW remained characteristically discrete
                about this budding relationship, but, if there is any prevailing theme to the final
                segment of Notebook 1, it is how inseparable Dora and Tom became throughout the fall
                of 1825.

                The son of Rear Admiral
                George Elliott of Copford, Essex, Mr. Elliott forged a distinguished military career
                himself, steadily advancing from ensign in 1782 to lieutenant colonel in 1799.

                A year after this final promotion, he married Anna Maria
                Maltby, the eldest surviving daughter of a wealthy merchant of Norwich. In 1804,
                however, their fortunes abruptly turned, when he was court-martialed for having
                knowingly sold the army horses that were unfit for action, found guilty, and
                stripped of his rank and commission.

                Where the Elliotts took refuge in the wake of this calamity is
                unclear, but there is no indication that any reputational stain followed them north
                in the 1820s. If anything, their new neighbors initially feared this fashionable and
                childless couple would find Westmorland life decidedly provincial, with their
                housekeeper at Ivy Cottage fretting that she would &#8220;have some trouble with the new
                Tenants&#8221; and MW spreading advance reports that Mrs. Elliott was &#8220;a fine 
                <emph>stately woman</emph>&#8221; who &#8220;expected to find in the Cottage the

                Such anxieties were soon
                dispelled, however, by the new arrivals&#8217; generosity and conviviality, and the
                Wordsworths quickly came to rely on both their company and newspaper subscriptions.
                Just days before the start of Notebook 1, the Elliotts vacated Ivy Cottage and took
                temporary accommodations in Ambleside. Thereafter they spent much of 1825 in
                Devonshire with friends before returning to the area that autumn.

                that quickly blossomed into an intimate friendship with the entire family at RM.
                Miss Jewsbury, or Jane to her close friends, spent most of her most of her
                adolescence in Leicestershire, where her father, Thomas (1767–1840), ran a series of
                only moderately successful textile mills. Seeking a fresh start, he moved his family
                to Manchester in 1818 and found work selling cotton goods and fire insurance. A year
                later, however, tragedy struck, when his wife, Maria (née Smith, 1778–1819), died
                shortly after delivering their seventh child, leaving the then-19-year-old Jane
                responsible for raising her younger siblings. Despite these heavy domestic
                obligations and her often debilitating chronic sicknesses, Jewsbury began regularly
                contributing to the
                <title level="m">Manchester Gazette </title>in 1821, and by the
                mid-1820s she seemed poised to join the likes of Letitia Landon, Caroline Bowles,
                and Felicia Hemans in the vanguard of English &#8220;poetesses.&#8221; Upon first meeting this
                vivacious young writer in the spring of 1825, DW called her &#8220;a young woman of

                The admiration was mutual,
                as later that year, while confiding a fear of growing old to Dora, Jewsbury mused,
                &#8220;if I could age like your Aunt W – &amp; unite green vigour with grey maturity, it

                was historically known—had been home to several generations of Knotts.

                used this inheritance to buy her new Loughrigg residence, Fox Ghyll, and begin the

                 Judging from the <title level="m">RJ</title>, any attempts Dora or her Aunt Dorothy made to dissuade
                the 31-year-old &#8220;beau from York,&#8221; as MW had dubbed him in September, were
                ineffectual, as Notebook 1 shows the cousins being largely inseparable between his
                arrival on 8 October and her parents&#8217; return from Coleorton on 17 November.

                discrete, but such was his ardor that, after leaving the area early in the new year,
                he made his case in writing to WW. The poet responded &#8220;instantly&#8221; and decisively,
                thanking his relation for being forthright but bluntly refusing permission on the
                entirely unromantic grounds that it would be better for all parties if the

                His unexpected death left

                helping to compensate for the financial and emotional support that was increasingly
                unforthcoming from Mrs. Coleridge&#8217;s husband. Despite being routinely linked together
                in the public mind, Southey and WW were more rivals than friends for the first
                decade of their acquaintance, especially after Southey published a withering review
                of <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> in 1798. DW initially shared her brother&#8217;s
                disdain, believing Southey showed &#8220;nothing of the dignity or enthusiasm of the
                Poet&#8217;s Character&#8221;; but her opinion was irrevocably changed in 1805 by his
                compassionate response to her brother John&#8217;s tragic death, as he &#8220;was so tender and
                kind that I loved him all at once – he wept with us in our sorrow, and for that

                Eight years later, as a
                confirmed bachelor in his mid-thirties, Tillbrook bought Ivy Cottage at the bottom
                of Rydal Hill. Since his commitments at Peterhouse precluded inhabiting the house
                for much of the year, he typically leased it out, and over time several of his
                tenants—including the Quillinans, Gees, and Elliotts—became intimates of the
                Wordsworths. While Tillbrook himself developed a cordial relationship with his
                neighbors, he never became as close to WW as he was to Robert Southey.

                If anything, the bishop&#8217;s wife had an even more elite

                        the eldest, Dorothy, provided fodder for local gossips by carrying on a

                        Southey noted that Curwen &#8220;confesses to impudence but vows &amp; protests
                        innocence as to any thing farther.&#8221; To this, Southey spitefully added that Miss

                While the Watsons and Wordsworths rarely
                interacted during the bishop&#8217;s lifetime, they became increasingly friendly
                thereafter, partly as a reflecting of the Wordsworths&#8217; increasing standing both in
                the community and beyond. The <title level="m">RJ</title> show the families exchanging
                visits a few times each year, and DW noted in a February 1826 letter that &#8220;at Rydal
                we get no new publications except through Southey – and sometimes from the Watsons
