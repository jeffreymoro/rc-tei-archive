                        Dorothy Wordsworth wrote for William Johnson in late 1818. It is itself a letter,
                        sent to “Miss Hutchinson” (probably Sara) in January 1819.

                        own copy (DCMS 51); it also supplies roughly 300 words missing from DCMS 51 because
                        of a tear in that manuscript’s last page. The Kenyon Transcript differs from DCMS
                        51 in punctuation, orthography, and other details. Certain spelling variations (e.g.,
                        “Seathwate,” “Scar Fell”) may be hearing errors rather than transcription errors;
                        possibly the scribe worked from dictation. For particulars on this document, reasons
                        for calling it the “Kenyon Transcript,” and ongoing research concerning it, please

               <p>Though known to scholars for decades, the document our edition calls the Kenyon Transcript
                  remains mysterious. It has traditionally been catalogued as Dorothy’s “Letter to William
                  Johnson,” but this designation is slightly misleading. First of all, Dorothy had no
                  direct part in creating this document; indeed, there is no way to know if she even
                  authorized it. Second, it was not mailed to William Johnson. It might have been mailed
                  <span style="font-style:italic">by</span> him, or under his supervision, but that is a separate matter—see our conjectures
                  in the following paragraphs. It seems best, all things considered, to emphasize that
                  this is a copy of the Johnson letter, not the letter itself. It was a new document
                  created with a different audience in mind.</p>
               <p>We have limited information about the Kenyon Transcript’s making. The editors of William
                  and Dorothy Wordsworth’s letters (second edition), Moorman and Hill, supposed that
                  the copyist might be John Carter, William Wordsworth’s longtime clerk. However, handwriting
                  comparison shows that this tentative attribution is incorrect. Ultimately, we do not
                  know for certain who made the transcript or why, but we do have several clues. </p>
               <p>Though a letter, in some ways the Kenyon Transcript hardly seems like one: it includes
                  no salutation, no signature, no epistolary framing at all aside from the fact that
                  it is folded, addressed, and mailed. However, its address panel provides essential
                  information (fig. 5.10). This panel features different handwriting from the body of
                  the text (perhaps two different hands, in fact—one for the date line and the other
                  for the address) and reads, “Ellesmere January three 1819 / Miss Hutchinson / Hindwell
                  / Radnor.” Inserted on the left is “free[?] Kenyon,” which we take to be a parliamentary
                  frank. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Ellesmere is a market town in Shropshire. “Miss Hutchinson,” presumably, is Sara Hutchinson,
                     who is mentioned briefly in the transcription.

                              uncertainty. The transcript’s mention of SH comes at the end: “To add to our uncommon
                              performances on this Day Miss Barker and I each wrote a letter from the top of the

               <p>Summarizing, then, the Kenyon Transcript is a copy of Dorothy Wordsworth’s late-October
                  1818 letter to William Johnson that was made sometime between then and 3 January 1819.
                  It was sent from Ellesmere to the Hutchinsons’ home in Radnor, some 47 miles away,
                  under a certain Kenyon’s franking privilege. With these facts in mind, we can begin
                  to reconstruct a possible history of the manuscript. </p>

                              acquaintances that it would not be at all surprising to learn that they had met. William’s
                              brother Christopher corresponded with Lord Kenyon (see, for instance, a letter of
                              5 December 1816, which Christopher sent to Kenyon at Gredington—cited in Royal Commission

                     </div> but he knew several of her friends. Consequently, unfolding the history of this transcript
                     involves reconstructing a social network. The first character of note, naturally,
                     is Johnson himself, the recipient of Dorothy’s original letter, who had become close
                     to the Wordsworths during his 1811–1812 curacy in Grasmere. Johnson knew the Hutchinsons
                     as well and might have wished to forward Dorothy’s account to Hindwell in any case.
                     But what was Johnson’s connection, if any, to Kenyon? It turns out that Johnson was
                     affiliated with an organization called the National Society for Promoting the Education
                     of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church in England and Wales (hereafter
                     “National Society”), founded in 1811, and that Kenyon was one of that organization’s
                     vice presidents.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The National Society established schools employing the “Madras System” of mutual instruction
                     pioneered by Dr. Andrew Bell, the next important character in our story. Bell and
                     Kenyon were allies in their shared educational projects; and Bell, like Johnson, was
                     a friend to Dorothy and William Wordsworth.

                     to place him at the head of his model Central School in London. We also know that
                     Bell was acquainted with the Hutchinsons as well as with Dorothy’s climbing companion,

                     </div> In short, Dorothy’s writing was probably circulating among this entire set of acquaintances—people
                     who often communicated in person when not doing so by letter.

                  <p>Several questions remain. Judging from the handwriting, Kenyon did not personally
                     duplicate Dorothy’s remarkable ascent narrative, but who did? Not Bell or Johnson—their
                     hands, too, were quite different. Possibly a clerk for one of these men was the scribe,
                     or perhaps one of them wished to test an amanuensis.

                              was introduced to Bell by Kenyon in late 1817 or early 1818. One sample of Davies’s
                              writing, an 1831 letter from Bell to Lady Burke, survives in the archive at the Wordsworth
                              Trust. Some features of his hand resemble elements in the Kenyon Transcript, but others
                              match less closely. Given that the 1818 letter to Hindwell was a fair copy of sorts,
                              presumably in the transcriber’s finest writing, and that the 1831 letter is a sample
                              of quick dictation (written, moreover, well over a decade later), it is hard to draw
                              …</span></div>
                     </div> Further research on Kenyon’s, Bell’s, or Johnson’s papers may yet allow us to identify
                     the copyist with certainty. Even then, however, we shall be left with a puzzle, not
                     knowing precisely why the copy was made and sent. One can, of course, imagine scenarios:
                     for instance, Johnson, along with Bell and Kenyon, might suspect that the Hutchinson
                     family would enjoy reading Dorothy’s account, especially because Sara was mentioned
                     in it and had already been teased by “wish-you-were-here” notes written by Dorothy
                     and Mary Barker at the Scafell Pike summit. (Indeed, the fact that the Kenyon Transcript
                     begins without preamble makes one wonder if the recipient were already expecting it.)
                     And then, Johnson might appreciate an excuse to reach out to his old friends, the
                     Hutchinsons—at one point, Sara and others thought that Johnson might be a good match
                     for her younger sister Joanna, who was also at Hindwell in January 1819.
