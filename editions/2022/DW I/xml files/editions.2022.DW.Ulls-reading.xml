                <p>William and Mary returned from Parkhouse by the Patterdale road along with Mr. and Mrs. Clarkson, having made a delightful excursion of 
                    three days.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Park House was the hilltop farm home of Thomas Hutchinson and (sometimes) Sara Hutchinson, siblings to WW&#8217;s 
                        wife, who had moved there from Gallow Hill, North Yorkshire, in May 1804. It was on the Dalemain Estate, about two miles north of Ullswater 
                        and three to the southwest of Penrith. [Illustration: Park House.] &#8220;Mr. and Mrs. Clarkson&#8221; were Thomas, the prominent abolitionist, and 
                        his wife, Catherine, who had lived at Eusemere near Pooley Bridge (not far from Park House) from 1796 to 1803. They had recently moved 
                        south for the sake of Catherine&#8217;s health, but they spent the summer of 1805 catching up with the Wordsworths at Grasmere, and in late 
                        October presumably wished to bid farewell to old friends and haunts before settling at Catherine&#8217;s hometown, Bury St Edmunds 
                        in Suffolk.
                    </note>
                    They had engaged that William and I should go to Mr. Luff&#8217;s on Wednesday or Thursday if the weather continued favorable.

                        The Wordsworths got to know the Luffs through the Clarksons. [Illustration: Side Farm.]<!--not sure if this is supposed to be a link or not-->

                        sometimes be troublesome, as shown later in the excursion when it refuses to carry both her and WW across the River Eamont. One of DW&#8217;s 
                        letters to Richard, written a few days after the tour (15 November 1805), explains that the pony has an unfortunate tendency to 
                        stumble, prompting her to think she must replace it. This she regrets because she enjoys riding and finds that the pony&#8217;s paces &#8220;suit

                    the sun. After dinner we walked with Mrs. Luff up the Vale; I had never had an idea of the extent and width of it in passing thro&#8217; along the 
                    road on the other side. We walked along the Path which leads from house to house; two or three times it took us through some of those copses 
                    or groves that cover every little hillock in the middle of the lower part of the Vale, making an intricate and beautiful intermixture of lawn 
                    and woodland. We left William to prolong his walk, and when he came into the house he told us that he had pitched upon the spot where he

                    When we sate on the hillside, though we were well contented with the quiet every-day sounds, the lowing of cattle, bleating of sheep, and the very 
                    gentle murmuring of the valley stream, yet we could not but think what a grand effect the sound of the Bugle Horn would have among these mountains. 
                    It is still heard once a year at the Chace I have spoken of, a day of festivity for all the Inhabitants of this District except the poor Deer, the 
                    most ancient of them all. The ascent, even to the top of the mountain, is very easy.

                    When we had accomplished it we had some exceedingly fine mountain views, some of the mountains being resplendent with sunshine, others partly 
                    hidden by clouds. Ulswater was of a dazzling brightness bordered by black hills &#8211; the Plain beyond Penrith smooth and bright, (or rather 
                    <hi rend="underline">gleamy</hi>) as the sea or sea Sands. Looked into Boar Dale above Sanwick, deep and bare, a stream winding down it.

                    After having walked a considerable way on the tops of the hills, came in view of Glenriddin and the <span change="blue">[Page 9] </span>mountains 
                    above Grisdale. Luff then took us aside, before we had begun to descend, to a small Ruin which was formerly a Chapel or place of worship where the 
                    Inhabitants of Martindale and Patterdale were accustomed to meet on Sabbath days.
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors"> This tiny ruin is sometimes called the &#8220;Chapel in the Hause&#8221; due to its location at Boredale Hause, midway

                    There are now no traces by which you could discover that the Building had been different from a common sheep-fold; the loose stones, and the few 
                    which yet remain piled up are the same as those which lie about on the mountain; but the shape of the building, being oblong, is not that of a 
                    common sheep-fold, and it stands East and West. Whether it was ever consecrated ground or not I know not; but the place may be kept holy in the 
                    memory of some now living in Patterdale; for it was the means of preserving the life of a poor old man last summer who, having gone up the mountain 
                    to gather peats, had been overtaken by a storm, and could not find his way down again. He happened to be near the remains of the old Chapel, and, 
                    in a corner of it, he contrived, by laying turf and ling

                    and stones from one wall to the other, to make a shelter from the wind, and there he lay all night. The Woman who had sent him on his errand began 
                    to grow uneasy towards <span change="blue">[Page 10]</span> night and the neighbours went out to seek him. At that time the old Man had housed himself 
                    in his nest, and he heard the voices of the men; but could not make <hi rend="underline">them</hi> hear, the wind being so loud, and he was 
                    afraid to leave the spot least he should not be able to find it again, so he remained there all night, and they returned to their homes giving him 
                    up for lost; but the next morning the same persons discovered him huddled up in the sheltered nook. He was, at first, stupefied and unable to move; 
                    but after he had eaten and drunk, and recollected himself a little, he walked down the mountain, and did not afterwards seem to have suffered.

                    As we descend, the Vale of Patterdale appears very simple and grand with its two heads, Deep-dale, and Brotherswater or Hartsop. It is remarkable 
                    that two pairs of Brothers should have been drowned in that Lake. There is a tradition, at least, that it took its name from two who were drowned 
                    there many years ago, and it is a fact that two others did meet that melancholy fate about twenty years since. It was upon a New-year&#8217;s Day. 
                    Their Mother had sent them to thresh some corn, and they, probably thinking it hard to be so tasked when all others were keeping holiday, stole 
                    out to slide upon the ice and were both drowned. A Neighbour <span change="blue">[Page 11]</span> who had seen them fall through the ice, though not 
                    near enough to be certain, guessed who they were, and went to the mother to inquire after her sons. She replied that they were in the Barn 
                    threshing, &#8220;Nay,&#8221; said the Man, [&#8220;]they are not there, I am sure, and it is not likely today.&#8221; The Woman went with him to the Barn and the Boys 
                    were gone: he was then confirmed, and told her that he believed that they were drowned. It is said that they were found locked in each other&#8217;s 
                    arms. I was exceedingly tired when we reached home, owing to the steepness and roughness of the peat track by which we descended. I lay down on the 
                    Sofa in Mrs. Luff&#8217;s parlour and was asleep in three minutes&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;. A fine moonlight night &#8211; a thick fog in the middle of the Vale, which 
                    disheartened William about the situation of his house. Supped on some of the Fish caught by the Fishermen at the foot of Place Fell. We thought

                    by the mists the other day. It had been a sharp frost in the night, and the grass and trees were yet wet. We observed the lemon-coloured leaves

                    beginning of the first Park William got upon the pony, and, betwixt a walk and a run, I kept pace with him while he trotted to the next gate; 
                    then I mounted again. We were joined by two Travellers; like ourselves, with one white horse between them. We went on in company till we came 
                    near to Patterdale, trotting most of the time. The Trees in Gowborough Park were very beautiful, the hawthorns leafless &#8211; their round 
                    heads covered with rich red berries, and adorned with arches of green brambles, and eglantine hung with glossy hips &#8211; Many birches yet 
                    tricked out in full foliage of bright yellow &#8211; Oaks brown or leafless &#8211; the smooth branches of the ashes bare &#8211; most of the 
                    alders green as in spring. I think I have more pleasure in looking at deer than any other animals, perhaps chiefly from their living in a more 
                    natural state. At the end of Gowborough Park, a large Troop of them were moving slowly, or standing still, among the fern. I was grieved when our 
                    companions startled them with a whistle, disturbing a beautiful image of grave simplicity and thoughtful enjoyment; for I could have fancied that 
                    even they were partaking with me a sensation of the solemnity of the closing day. <span change="blue">[Page 16] </span>The sun had been set some time, 
                    though we could only just perceive that the daylight was partly gone, and the Lake was more brilliant than before. I dismounted again at Stybarrow 
                    Crag,
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8220;Stybarrow Crag is a lofty promontory, deeply scarred by winds and torrents, terminating a mountainous 
                            ridge that descends from Helvellyn. A road winds beneath this crag, commanding a fine view of Ullswater&#8221; (Rose, 
                            <title level="m">Westmorland,  Cumberland, Durham</title>, 179). [Illustration: photo of Stybarrow from Silver Crag.]

                    and William rode till we came almost to Glenriddin. Found the Luffs at tea in the kitchen. After tea set out again; Luff accompanied me on foot and 
                    William continued to ride till we came to the foot of Brothers-water. &#8211; A delightful evening &#8211; the Seven Stars close to the hill 
                    tops in Patterdale &#8211; all the stars seemed brighter than usual. The steeps were reflected in Brothers-water, and above the Lake appeared like 
                    enormous black perpendicular walls. The torrents of Kirkstone had been swoln by the rains, and filled the mountain Pass with their roaring, which 
                    added greatly to the solemnity of our walk &#8211; the stars in succession took their stations on the mountain tops. Behind us, when we had 
                    climbed very high we saw one light in the Vale at a great distance, like a large star, a solitary one, in the gloomy region &#8211; all the 
                    cheerfulness of the scene was in the sky above us. Found Mary &amp; the children in bed &#8211; no fire &#8211; luckily William was warm with 
                    walking, and I not cold, having wrapped myself up most carefully, &amp; the night being mild.</hi>
