                      is remarkable for at least two related reasons. First, it is a landmark in the history
                     of British mountaineering—one of the earliest reports of a recreational climb of Scafell
                     Pike (3,209 ft., or 978 m) and the first by a woman.

                              Guide (1819), William Green described summiting the mountain with Jonathan Otley in
                              September 1816 and noted that Otley had already done so with Edward Birkett in June
                              1815 (2:318–26). If, as Green claims, he began writing his book in late 1816 and printing
                              it in 1817 (1:vii), his account predated DW’s. It was certainly first in print, as
                              DW’s did not appear until 1822.</span></div>
                     </div> Second, it captures an aspect of Dorothy’s life that has sometimes been overlooked.
                     Dorothy Wordsworth was a prodigious walker—this fact is well known—but her pioneering
                     achievements as a mountaineer have insufficiently shaped the public’s memory of her.

                     “Excursion”

                      out of the shadow of her brother’s writing. One admirer subtly pointed this out in
                     1855, the year of Dorothy’s death. In a letter to the editor of the <em>Kendal Mercury</em>, venerable mountain guide Jonathan Otley hinted that there was more to tell about
                     the now-famous Scafell Pike adventure: “The story of the ascent of Scawfell, in Wordsworth’s
                     Guide, said in some former editions to be extracted from a letter to a friend; and
                     in the last edition from a letter by a friend, is well told, and is good as far as
                     it goes; but it might have been improved by a prefatory introduction, and extended
                     by an appendix.”

                              to counteract the tendency to mythologize writer-mountaineers while overlooking those
                              who accompanied them and helped make their accomplishments possible. Agnes was obviously
                              a fit and trusted companion for Mary Barker, though we know little more about her.

                     at Rydal to be near the Wordsworths. Sir George and Lady Beaumont, dear friends and

                     larger “Lake Poet” circle, and in 1814, Dorothy described her to Catherine Clarkson
                     as the epitome of “Generosity, Frankness, Sincerity, and perfect disinterestedness.”

                  <p>In the course of conversation, the Wilberforces expressed their intent to ride up
                     Skiddaw (3,054 ft., 931 m), the far-famed mountain overlooking Keswick, on the following
                     morning, and the Beaumonts pledged to accompany them. Wilberforce would be revisiting
                     an ascent he made years earlier while touring the Lakes as a young man. Accordingly,
                     most of the visitors returned to Keswick for the night, looking forward to their outing,
                     but Dorothy stayed at Rosthwaite. She and her host settled on their own hiking plan.
                     Thus, as Dorothy reports, she and Mary Barker summited Scafell Pike on the same day
                     their friends explored Skiddaw, 14 miles to the north. The Skiddaw excursion was less
                     ambitious than the Scafell Pike ascent; still, as Wilberforce was in his late 50s
                     and the Beaumonts in their 60s, none of them in perfect health, we should admire the
                     spirit of this group as well—not least because they got a good wetting in the rain.

                     excellent views of the surrounding peaks and valleys. Barker, of late “an active climber
                     of the hills,” had recently been to Esk Hause and was eager to share the “magnificent
                     prospect.”

                              Barker confidently promised her fantastic views from Esk Hause. On the earlier occasion,
                              Otley reports, “Miss B. was so enraptured with the prospect that it was not till her
                              maid reminded her that the sun was going down, that she could think of leaving the

                              own way down into Borrowdale, having been abandoned by their guide. At Seathwaite,
                              they happened to meet John Allison, who promised to “direct [Miss Barker] by a better

                     </div> However, when the friends arrived at the pass, they decided to press on. As Dorothy
                     reports, their “spirit of enterprise” did not fail, and they climbed where, so far
                     as we can tell, few other recreational walkers had been.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Because it was a fine day, they could see for miles in every direction. Heart-stopping
                  views like this were relatively uncommon in an age unfamiliar with air travel and
                  satellite imagery. However, Dorothy characteristically noticed close-range features
                  as well as the vast panorama. She observed, for instance, that the rocks were “covered
                  with never-dying lichens . . . adorn[ed] with colours of the most vivid and exquisite
                  beauty.” She also observed the extreme silence of the summit, having had the sound
                  of mountain streams in her ears for much of the ascent.</p>
               <p>Despite her emphasis on accurate description, Dorothy explored the limits of her perceptions.
                  Looking out from the mountain to the sea (over 12 miles away), she supposed she saw
                  a ship. “<span style="font-style:italic">Is</span> it a ship?” her smiling guide asked. Barker quickly supported Dorothy’s conclusion:
                  “A ship, yes, it can be nothing else.” However, a moment later, the “ship” had become
                  a horse, for in fact the friends had been watching a cloud. Dorothy enjoyed this joke
                  on herself, resolving to remember it when she was “again inclined to positiveness.”
                  Like many great Romantic texts, Dorothy’s 
                  “Excursion”
                  reminds us that what we see depends to some extent on prior experience, perspective,
                  and imagination.</p>

                  <p>Reading Dorothy’s account, one gets the impression that she was pleased with herself,
                     and rightly so. She remarks upon the “continuance of that vigour of body, which enabled
                     me to climb the high mountain, as in the days of my youth” and reports that she and

                  she used to share it. Readers often locate her influence indirectly, in poems of William’s
                  that rework her journal entries, in letters that reveal her collaboration, and so
                  forth, but except on occasions when William mentions her directly or includes her
                  verses in his collections, it is often difficult to say, “There it is—there’s Dorothy’s
                  mark.”</p>
               <p>Yet Dorothy’s mark is visible on England’s highest mountain, where walkers have unwittingly
                  followed her footsteps for two centuries now. Almost literally, you find those footsteps
                  inscribed on the landscape in the form of trails (fig. 5.4). To be sure, many aspects
                  of trail-making are determined by practical factors unrelated to literary history,
                  but Dorothy’s Scafell Pike route has endured partly because of her writing’s intersection
                  with the nineteenth century’s multiplication of maps and guidebooks.</p>

               <p>Dorothy observed of Scafell Pike’s rocky summit, “No gems or flowers can surpass in
                  colouring the beauty of some of these masses of stone which no human eye beholds except
                  the shepherd led thither by chance or traveler by curiosity; and how seldom this must
                  happen!”—seldom because, as she noted, sheep would find little in the rocks to eat,
                  and because recreational fell-walking there was still in its early days. However,
                  once Dorothy’s letter found its way into William’s <em>Guide</em>, a transformative process began. By incorporating Dorothy’s ascent narrative (not
                  far removed in genre from accounts that would later appear in Alfred Wainwright’s
                  books and on trekking websites), the <em>Guide</em> made it a permanent part of the tourist literature and encouraged readers to imagine
                  and undertake their own mountain ascents.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Just as importantly, William’s <em>Guide</em> provided material that would be recycled by other travel writers. Numerous Lakeland
                     guidebooks of the Victorian era, including Harriet Martineau’s famous <em>Complete Guide</em> (fig.5.5), lingered on the <em>Guide</em>’s description of climbing Scafell hike. Normally, writers attributed the description
                     to William, if they attributed it at all, but in doing so they enshrined Dorothy’s
                     descriptive language and itinerary.

                     he concluded, “It may well be that never shall we witness such storm-grandeur as it
                     was Wordsworth’s lot to witness when, having climbed hither on a still autumn day,

               <p>Although De Sélincourt categorized Dorothy’s Scafell Pike account with her journals,
                  it is not a diary entry per se. This genre question deserves consideration, for some
                  of the text’s character depends on its material forms, its circulation, and its audiences.</p>
               <p>In conception, Dorothy’s account emerged from a cluster of letters—including, we presume,
                  the lost one she wrote to Sara Hutchinson on top of the mountain. The earliest surviving
                  record of her ascent is her letter to Jane Marshall, dated 14 October 1818, which
                  reads like a seed draft for the expanded report she would pen a week later. Dorothy
                  expresses continued admiration for William Wilberforce (“There never lived on earth,
                  I am sure, a man of sweeter temper”) and recaps the lively 6 October dinner at Rosthwaite.
                  “The next day,” she continues, “which was one of the finest of the year, I ascended
                  Scaw Fell from Seathwaite with Miss Barker—and never before did I behold so sublime
                  a mountain prospect.” Grateful for the weather they enjoyed, she reports, “Our Guide,
                  who is a Shepherd of Borrowdale, turning his eyes thoughtfully round when we were
                  on the pinnacle of Scaw Fell, said ‘I do not know that ever in the whole course of
                  my life, I was at any season so high upon the mountains on so calm a day.’ There was
                  not a breath of wind to stir the very papers which we spread out with our food, when
                  we ate our dinners on that commanding eminence.” Some of this language would reappear
                  almost verbatim in Dorothy’s final treatment of the subject.</p>
               <p>The experience of climbing the mountain obviously remained vivid in Dorothy’s mind.
                  Eager to share it at length, she wrote on 21 October to the Reverend William Johnson,
                  former curate and schoolmaster in Grasmere (1811–1812), who had since taken up an
                  important teaching post in London. The original of her letter has been lost. Fortunately,
                  two copies survive, and these are our manuscript authorities for 
                  “Excursion up Scawfell Pike.”

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The most complete extant manuscript is Dorothy’s own backup copy: as noted previously,
                     she transcribed her letter to Johnson into a hand-sewn notebook, which is now catalogued
                     as Dove Cottage Manuscript (DCMS) 51 (fig. 5.6). Similar to DCMS 120, which preserves
                     Dorothy’s <a class="link_ref" href="/editions.DW.editions.2023.DW.Poems-intro.html">poetry</a>, DCMS 51 collects literary efforts that she valued.

                      is its final item (fig. 5.7). It features both Dorothy’s edits in ink and various
                     pencil marks, possibly by William, which move the text in the direction of his <em>Guide</em>.

                              project, and it is likely that there are multiple layers. Possibly DW herself undertook

                  <p>The second surviving manuscript, described hereafter as the Kenyon Transcript, is
                     written in an attractive, unknown hand on paper watermarked 1817 (fig. 5.8). At once
                     a letter in its own right (addressed to “Miss Hutchinson” in Wales) but otherwise
                     businesslike, with no conventional gestures of greeting or conclusion, it is actually
                     an incomplete copy of Dorothy’s letter to Johnson. It is dated “October, 1818” and
                     bracketed entirely within quotation marks. It begins, “I must inform you of a feat
                     that Miss Barker and I performed on Wednesday the 7th of this month.” In short, it
                     omits material that takes up more than a page of Dorothy’s notebook version, including
                     her introduction of Mary Barker and her description of the dinner at Barker’s home.
                     As Simon Bainbridge summarizes, it “edits out the first part of the original letter
                     to focus on the ascent narrative.”

               <p>While DCMS 51 is longer and arguably more authoritative than the Kenyon Transcript,
                  much of its final page has been torn out and lost (fig. 5.9). Therefore, at least
                  for the closing section of Dorothy’s account, the Kenyon Transcript is essential.</p>

               <p>Furthermore, the Kenyon Transcript may match the original Johnson letter more closely
                  than the DCMS 51 copy in some respects. We suggest this because DCMS 51 shows edits
                  for style and economy that the Kenyon Transcript does not include. Derived directly
                  from the Johnson letter (or from yet another copy that has not survived), the Kenyon
                  Transcript likely retains many original readings, despite errors in copying. Additionally,
                  the transcript includes a final paragraph that Dorothy omits in DCMS 51: “I believe
                  that you are not much acquainted with the Scenery of this Country, except in the Neighbourhood
                  of Grasmere, your duties when you were a resident here, having confined you so much
                  to that one Vale; I hope, however, that my long Story will not be very dull; and even
                  I am not without a further hope, that it may awaken in you a desire to spend a long
                  holiday among the Mountains, and explore their recesses.” No doubt this invitation
                  was part of the original letter to Johnson, but Dorothy saw no reason to copy it for
                  her own records.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The Kenyon Transcript complicates the view that Dorothy’s text was never published

                     and associates.

                              took the place alike of semicolons, colons, and periods); but the Wordsworth family
                              were so arbitrary and casual in their letter-writing—and even careless at times—…</span></div>

                     and her intentions can be hard to discern. Dorothy’s underlined words are set in italics.
                     Her ampersands are converted to <span style="font-style:italic">and</span>, and her occasional abbreviations are expanded—for example, “Sir G. and &amp; Lady B.”
                     to “Sir George and Lady Beaumont.” Capitalization is largely standardized, though
                     we retain some instances in which Dorothy seems to capitalize common nouns for emphasis.
                     We also retain Dorothy’s spelling.</p>

               <p>Admittedly, any regularization may obscure important ambiguities or idiosyncrasies

                  frequent and varied uses of dashes, as such marks either disappear in our reading

                     the account timeless. It introduces various minor revisions.

                              of the Guide) about “celestial” drinking water on neighboring Great Gavel; inserts
                              a comparison between the colors of Scafell Pike’s lichen-painted stones and “brilliant
                              feathers”; and so forth. However, these are minor features; the principal transformation
                              comes from removing contextual framing and the participants’ names.</span></div>
                     </div> However, the most obvious difference between Dorothy’s manuscript and the adaptation
                     is the latter’s reduced length. William’s version includes approximately 1,205 words,
                     whereas Dorothy’s original runs over 2,500. Unsurprisingly, Dorothy’s text is richer.
                     The <em>Guide</em>’s main editorial tendency is to make Dorothy’s narrative less personal. In the manuscript,
                     Dorothy begins by recording the visits of the Beaumonts and Wilberforces and by introducing
                     Mary Barker—that is, by assembling her cast of characters. All of this social context
                     disappears in the <em>Guide</em>. Thus, when the <em>Guide</em> reports, “Having left Rossthwaite [<span style="font-style:italic">sic</span>] in Borrowdale . . . we ascended,” readers have little sense of who “we” might be.
                     In Dorothy’s manuscript, readers find friendship, personality, wonder, and humor,
                     all shaping an expedition organized by two intrepid women. In William’s abridgment,
                     readers mainly encounter landscape visions that might be comparable with those afforded
                     by the Alps.

                  <p>What might Dorothy’s feelings have been about supplying this text for William’s <em>Guide</em>? We have a few key facts to consider. First, Dorothy was part of the project from
                     the start. Back at the time of <em>Select Views</em> (1810), the first version of what became the <em>Guide</em>, William asked Dorothy to finish some of the writing when the work became “irksome”
                     to him.

                     </div> Meanwhile, Dorothy opined that William might repurpose <em>Select Views</em>, create his own guide to the Lake District, and find the product more lucrative than
                     his “higher [poetic] labours.”

                     </div> William eventually took her advice by including <em>Select Views</em> material in his 1820 <em>River Duddon</em> volume. This experiment resulted in encouraging sales and reviews, so issuing a stand-alone
                     guidebook seemed like a logical next step. However, for this purpose, William likely
                     sensed that his text needed some padding out.

                     willing—perhaps even pleased—to see it in print, even if it would appear in truncated
                     form. Perhaps William transformed it for his own ends, but we should keep in mind
                     the likelihood that Dorothy wanted him to use it and even preferred that he remove
                     personal details about her and her friends. Indeed, she may have assisted with the

                      This instance of appropriation seems unique in scale and significance, as William

                     Might it not have been a simple matter for William to describe the account as “an

                     may apply in this situation: “Dorothy’s preference was always for an anonymous role
                     in their collaboration, but this need not be read as a sign that she believed herself
                     inferior. . . . Her labour was not alienated, and she knew her gifts to be greatly
                     valued.”

                              it “helped to make [WW’s] reputation”; therefore, “it is well past time to discard

               If, as Green claims, he began writing his book in late 1816 and printing it in 1817
               (1:vii), his account predated DW’s. It was certainly first in print, as DW’s did not

               letter-writing “friend.” The textual change he mentions occurred in the second and
               third editions of Hudson’s <em>A Complete Guide to the Lakes</em> (1843, 1846), which incorporated WW’s <em>Guide</em> but added supplementary materials.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               in the <em>Kendal Mercury</em> letter previously cited. Otley was unreliable in some details, but he knew the people
               concerned and was sound in his basic recollections. While the names of the maid and
               guide do not appear in DW’s narrative, we include them in part to counteract the tendency
               to mythologize writer-mountaineers while overlooking those who accompanied them and
               helped make their accomplishments possible. Agnes was obviously a fit and trusted
               companion for Mary Barker, though we know little more about her. Perhaps John Allison
               was no Tenzing Norgay, but he deserves honorable mention in the history of British
               mountaineering alongside other shepherd-guides of the early days. About the unnamed
               porter, unfortunately, we know nothing at all. 
               <p>Regarding Agnes, see various letters of SH and DW’s own <em>Journal of a Tour on the Continent</em> (1820), in which she reports on visiting Mary Barker at Boulogne. At this reunion,
                  the party “had Borrowdale Agnes to wait upon us, a little frenchified in exterior,
                  it is true, but retaining her good Cumberland speech” (<em>DWJ</em>, 2:331). John Allison’s life is otherwise documented. His grave marker survives at
                  St. Andrew’s Churchyard, Stonethwaite. Fittingly, given his occupation, the stone
                  features a ram and ewe with their lambs and the inscription “Jesus Saith Feed My Sheep.”
                  A brief obituary appeared in the <em>Carlisle Patriot</em> for 27 January: “At Rosthwaite, in Borrowdale, John Allison, on the 22nd inst., Mr.
                  John Allison, yeoman, aged 68.” Given that Allison and DW passed away within three
                  days of each other in January 1855, Otley’s May letter can perhaps be understood as
                  a tribute to both.</p></span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               several writers of the younger generation condemned his active engagement in Tory
               politics. DW, for her part, supported WW’s efforts. For accounts of DW’s Scafell Pike

               personality” (
               “Two Wordsworths,”
               69). The most thorough biographical treatment of Barker is David Bradbury’s <em>Senhora Small Fry: Mary Barker and the Lake Poets</em> (2003). Barker is a major presence in Southey’s correspondence, and she sometimes
               appears in footnotes to literary history as the author of a 1798 novel, <em>A Welsh Story</em>; as the “Bhow Begum” of Southey’s <em>The Doctor</em>; or as the writer of the satirical

               . . . [,] with an annuity of 400 a year, and 1200 pounds in money . . . [,] is obliged
               to leave us, and a house in Borrowdale half finished (the foolish building of which,
               has caused this temporary ruin) and retire to France to live in her Uncle’s house,
               at Boulogne until her annuity can pay her debts. This is the precious fruits of having

               and accomplished” (Potter, <em>Minnow among Tritons</em>, 76). Because Barker moved to Boulogne in 1819 and never returned to England, the
               October 1818 walk was one of the last chances for her and DW to make such a memory.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               maid reminded her that the sun was going down, that she could think of leaving the
               place; vowing that she would visit it again ere long.” She and Agnes had to find their
               own way down into Borrowdale, having been abandoned by their guide. At Seathwaite,
               they happened to meet John Allison, who promised to “direct [Miss Barker] by a better
               route than the one by which she had descended.” Later, when DW visited, “[the friends]
               fixed upon an excursion, and called upon Mr. Allinson [<span style="font-style:italic">sic</span>] to redeem his promise” (<em>Kendal Mercury</em>, 26 May 1855, 6).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note17_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               John Marshall, a wealthy linen manufacturer and politician from Leeds, and now lived

               appears that the news was not yet universally accepted. DW and Mary Barker thought
               that neighboring Scafell was the higher peak and found out otherwise only after their
               ascent. Then, in the <em>Guide</em>, WW introduced DW’s account by saying that it recorded “a visit to a summit of one
               of the highest of these mountains,” as if he were not certain of its claim to be <span style="font-style:italic">the</span> highest (<em>A Description of the Scenery of the Lakes</em> [1822], 130—or <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.1835.html#:~:text=BANKS%20OF%20ULSWATER.-,117,-.%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0It%20was%20my">para. 117 in the 1835</a> <em>Guide</em> text).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note20_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note21"><span class="noteLabel">21. </span><span class="noteBody">WW makes this point himself in <em>Select Views</em>: “But it must be observed that the visits of travellers are for the most part confined
               to the Vales of Coniston, Winandermere with the intermediate country between Ambleside
               and Keswick, the Vale of Keswick itself, Buttermere, and Ulswater, which are the most
               easy of access, and indeed from their several characters most likely to repay general
               curiosity” (iii—<a class="link_ref" href="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.1810.html#:~:text=of%20the%20wheel.-,4.%C2%A0,-Such%2C%20concisely%20given">para. 4</a> in RC <em>Select Views edition</em>). In short, Romantic-era visitors normally looked <span style="font-style:italic">up</span> at the Lake District’s mountains, and when (increasingly) they did seek out the high
               places, they usually climbed Skiddaw or the more challenging Helvellyn.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note21_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note22"><span class="noteLabel">22. </span><span class="noteBody">At times, DW’s text was (mis-)cited with comical results. Consider Henry S. Salt’s
               <em>On Cambrian and Cumbrian Hills: Pilgrimages to Snowdon and Scawfell</em> (1908). Salt praises certain descriptions by poets like WW and Walter Scott but gripes
               that “on the whole . . . the poets have written about mountains as if they had never
               set foot on them, but had been content to take the panoramic ‘views’ of them from
               afar” (46). As evidence, he cites WW’s <em>Guide</em>: “Even Wordsworth’s prose account of his ascent from Seathwaite ‘to the top of the
               ridge, called Ash Course,’ makes one suspect that his real acquaintance with the hills
               was very slight; indeed his corruption of the guide’s pronunciation of ‘Esk Hause’
               . . . into the absurdity of ‘Ash Course,’ shows that he had but little sympathetic
               knowledge either of the nomenclature of the hills or of the dialect of the hillmen”
               (46). This sort of thing can happen when you publish your sister’s work as your own;
               by compressing her account, you make it less nuanced. DW mentions that “Ash Course”
               must be a corruption of “Esk Hause” and even provides the etymology for <span style="font-style:italic">Hause</span>, the normal word for a mountain saddle in the region. WW’s <em>Guide</em> cuts out her chatty and interesting explanation, leaving Salt, the latter-day man
               of the mountains, to conclude that the poet was ignorant.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note22_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               copy, now lost, might have been available to him. Owen and Smyser speculate on this

               He is often said to have been the first nonlocal to climb Scafell and also, accidentally,
               England’s first rock climber, as he got himself in a tight pinch while descending.
               From 5 August 1802, we have this self-dramatizing passage: “On a nice Stone Table
               am I now at this moment writing to you—between 2 and 3 o’clock as I guess, surely
               the first Letter ever written from the Top of Sca’ Fell!” He adds, “You shall call
               this Letter when it passes before you the Sca’Fell Letter.” See Griggs, <em>Collected Letters</em>, 2:834–51. As Bainbridge notes, STC’s letter would be for the Wordsworth circle the
               “best-known of all descriptions of mountain peril” (235).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note29_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               . .It might have been interesting, from a linguistic point of view, to preserve all
               the archaisms of spelling and punctuation (even when the dashes took the place alike
               of semicolons, colons, and periods); but the Wordsworth family were so arbitrary and
               casual in their letter-writing—and even careless at times—that it would have been
               unjust to them, as well as disturbing to their readers, to have done so” (1:xi).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note31_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               between the colors of Scafell Pike’s lichen-painted stones and “brilliant feathers”;
               and so forth. However, these are minor features; the principal transformation comes

         <div class="note" id="Note33"><span class="noteLabel">33. </span><span class="noteBody">WW’s 1822 title page promises “illustrative remarks upon the Scenery of the Alps,”
               and his attempt to “reconcile a Briton to the scenery of his own country” (120) has
               included an argument that, although the Lakeland fells cannot compare with the Alps
               in absolute height and grandeur, they compare favorably in their proportions and combinations.
               Accordingly, WW introduces DW’s account in this way: “The Reader may not however be
               displeased with the following extract from a letter to a Friend, giving an account
               of a visit to a summit of one of the highest of these mountains; of which I am reminded
               by the observations of Mr. West, and by reviewing what has been said of this district
               in comparison with the Alps” (129–30). He has already quoted West saying that Britons
               who intend to tour the Continent should begin in the Lake District “as it will give,
               in miniature, an idea of what they are to meet with there” (128). He and DW had recently
               undertaken this sort of comparison, exploring the Alps during their 1820 Continental
               tour.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note33_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
