                  <p>On Christmas Day of 2021, admirers of Dorothy Wordsworth (1771–1855) around the world
                celebrated the sestercentennial of a writer who, after long years in her elder
                brother’s shadow, has at last gained an independent reputation. Dorothy (fig. 1) is
                now widely known as one of nineteenth-century England’s most perspicacious nature
                writers and keen-eyed chroniclers of the everyday. There has never been a better
                time to study her life and work, as besides an ever-growing body of biographical and
                critical studies, recent decades have seen the arrival of several important print
                collections of her writings, including the first-ever classroom anthology of her
                “greatest hits” as a diarist, travel writer, and poet.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">See Susan Levin’s classroom anthology 
                <title level="m">Dorothy Wordsworth: A Longman Cultural Edition</title> (2009).
                Other important additions to the modern DW library include Pamela Woof’s Oxford
                World’s Classics edition of <title level="m">The Grasmere and Alfoxden
                Journals</title> (2002) and Carol Kyros Walker’s illustrated edition of
                DW’s <title level="m">Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland</title> (1997).</note>
                And, thanks to Google Books and other digital libraries, anyone with an internet
                connection can now freely access scans of the late Victorian editions that first
                introduced Dorothy’s (nearly) complete works to a broad readership.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">For our rationale in referencing the author
                throughout this edition as “Dorothy” rather than “Wordsworth”
                or “Dorothy Wordsworth,” see the separate prefatory essay on

                  <p>Even in the wake of such advances,
                <title level="m">Dorothy Wordsworth’s Lake District</title> represents
                a major step forward for both the general availability and scholarly study of her
                remarkable journals, poems, and travel writings. While more a topical anthology than
                complete works edition, this Romantic Circles Electronic Edition offers by far the
                most extensively annotated and meticulously transcribed collection of Dorothy’s
                texts to date. Its central thematic focus is the deep connection, at once aesthetic,
                affective, and spiritual, that this most observant of writers felt with the people
                and scenery of her native Lake District. Yet, even while concentrated on a single
                region, this edition might also be taken as a general introduction to Dorothy’s
                writings, as it samples widely from her output in a range of genres and across all
                phases of her adult life, featuring both well-known works like her Grasmere journal
                notebooks and others that have either never before been published or never appeared

                  <p>The third of John and Ann Wordsworth’s five eventual children, and their only
                daughter, Dorothy Wordsworth was born on 25 December 1771 in Cockermouth,
                Cumberland, a town in the northwest corner of the English Lake District (fig. 2).
                After six happy years with her parents and brothers, she suddenly found her
                comfortable childhood upended by her mother’s passing in early 1778. While her
                brothers would remain in the Lakes, staying with relatives when not attending
                Hawkshead Grammar School, Dorothy would largely be exiled from the region for over
                two decades, spending most of her formative years with relatives in Halifax,
                Yorkshire (1778–1787) and Forncett, Norfolk (1788–1794). An 18-month stay with her
                maternal grandparents in Penrith in 1787–1788 did little to ease her sense of
                displacement, though it did rekindle her love for the region’s beauty and yield
                lifelong friendships, especially with her future sister-in-law, Mary Hutchinson.</p>

                  <p>For good reason, then, virtually every biographer has stressed the joy and relief
                Dorothy felt in her mid-to-late 20s upon reconnecting with her siblings and
                returning to her native Cumbria. What is generally considered the happiest period of
                her life began in 1795, when she and William, the brother 20 months her senior to
                whom she had always felt especially close, were finally able to live under the same
                roof. Four years later, after sojourns in the south of England and in Germany, they
                and their younger brother John began planning to establish a permanent home in the
                Lakes. While touring the Lake District with Samuel Taylor Coleridge in November
                1799, William reported to Dorothy that “C[oleridge] was much struck with Grasmere
                and its neighbourhood and I have much to say to you[;] you will think my plan a mad
                one, but I have thought of building a house there by the Lake side. John would give
                me £40 to buy the ground, and for £250 I am sure I could build one as good as we can
                wish.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <title level="m">Letters</title>, 1:272.</note>
                This vision clearly outpaced their finances, as William and Dorothy were tight on funds and John
                was just launching his career as a merchant sailor. Nevertheless, the siblings were
                so taken with the prospect of making a home together in Grasmere that by the year’s
                end William and Dorothy had taken a lease on the home now known as Dove Cottage and
                John had promised to join them on his next shore leave.</p>
                  <p>Lucy Newlyn recently observed that, “returning to the Lake District to reclaim their
                regional identity and reestablish their family, the Wordsworths found themselves at
                one remove from their childhood origins—neither insiders nor quite outsiders in
                Grasmere.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <hi rend="italic">Newlyn</hi>, 120.</note>
                Yet any such dual consciousness was likely felt more acutely by Dorothy than her brothers,
                as, unlike them, she had not spent her formative years attending school just south of Grasmere
                in Hawkshead. Accordingly, her distinctive position as an insider-outsider in the
                Central Lakes frequently shows through in earlier selections in this edition
                (especially the first journal notebook), which display a deep curiosity about the
                area’s society, topography, and plant and animal species and speak in the voice of
                one making the transition from tourist to longtime resident.</p>
                  <p>While William and Dorothy would never build the dream house they began imagining in
                1799, their other wish, to establish a permanent home in the area, was fulfilled
                entirely. Dove Cottage served as their cramped but cherished abode from December
                1799 through May 1808, a period when the siblings composed many of their most iconic
                works and were joined first by Mary Hutchinson, whom William married in October
                1802, and then by the couple’s first three children. Famously, these were years of
                “plain living and high thinking,”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Line 11
                of WW’s sonnet <title level="a">Written in London. September, 1802.</title>

                blending domestic work, literary collaboration, and outdoor pursuits. Having
                outgrown Dove Cottage, the family spent three years at Allan Bank in Grasmere, where
                William and Mary’s two youngest children were born, followed by two years in the
                village rectory (figures 3–4). Then, in May 1813, after William secured a government
                post that significantly eased the family’s money worries, they moved two miles east
                of Grasmere to Rydal Mount, the spacious and comfortable home in which William,
                Mary, and Dorothy would reside until their respective deaths in the 1850s.</p>

                  <p>The Wordsworths’ Grasmere period is rightly celebrated in the annals of British
                literature. But if, as traditional accounts suggest, William’s peak years as a poet
                were behind him by 1813, the family’s first two decades at Rydal Mount saw Dorothy
                reach new heights both in her literary creativity and output. There she composed
                most of her poems and reworked for potential publication journals she kept on the
                Continent in 1820 and in Scotland in 1822. At Rydal she also returned to keeping a
                daily journal, ultimately filling 15 notebooks, known collectively as the
                <title level="m">Rydal Journals</title>, between 1824 and 1835. Two of these
                notebooks, the first and last, appear in their entirety for the first time in this
                edition.</p>
                  <p>Into her late fifties, Dorothy remained remarkably vigorous both in mind and body,
                frequently remarking that she felt even more energetic than in her twenties. But, as
                chronicled in the latter half of the <title level="m">Rydal Journals</title>, her
                health gradually but irreparably declined after she became severely ill in early
                1829. By the end of 1835 chronic pain, a lack of stamina, and intermittent dementia
                effectively ended her writing career, and she would spend her final two decades
                confined to the house and grounds of Rydal Mount. After her passing on 25 January
                1855, she was buried in the Grasmere churchyard alongside her brother William and
                numerous beloved friends and family members.</p>

                  <p>Considering that in his later years William was widely seen as England’s greatest
                living bard and that he would eventually replace Byron as the face of British
                Romanticism, it was perhaps inevitable that his sister’s life and works would first
                be valued primarily for whatever insights they afforded into his writings. And,
                while just how willingly Dorothy played the handmaiden to William’s genius remains
                hotly contested, her letters and journals suggest she would have had few qualms
                about going down in literary history as her brother’s unwavering assistant and
                occasional collaborator.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The ongoing debate over
                DW’s agency and WW’s treatment of her is front and center in two recent biographies.
                In Frances Wilson’s <title level="m">The Ballad of Dorothy Wordsworth</title> (2008),
                DW is cast as the victim of unrelenting emotional abuse at WW’s hands, which
                ultimately led to her early-onset dementia. More persuasively, Lucy Newlyn presents
                their relationship as undeniably collaborative and companionate, as reflected in her
                titling her 2013 joint biography <title level="m">William and Dorothy Wordsworth:
                “All in Each Other.”</title>
                     </note> Moreover, it is abundantly clear from the trove of
                unpublished journals, travelogues, stories, poems, and commonplace books she left
                behind that she wrote primarily for herself or close family and friends.</p>
                  <p>At the same time, as this collection repeatedly demonstrates, many of Dorothy’s
                literary efforts had a more public-facing and professional intent than has generally
                been acknowledged. Her longtime friend Thomas De Quincey, for one, attested to both
                her distinctive genius and bona fides as public author when he maintained in 1839,
                “Miss Wordsworth would have merited a separate notice in any biographical dictionary
                of our times, had there even been no William Wordsworth in existence.”

                254.</note> Seconding De Quincey’s assessment, this edition shines the spotlight
                solely on Dorothy, showcasing her gifts in a variety of literary forms and her distinctive
                perspectives on the people and places of the English Lakes.</p>
                  <p>The initial spark for this project can be traced to an earlier Romantic Circles
                collaboration, the scholarly edition of William Wordsworth’s <title level="m">
                        <ref target="/editions.DW.editions.2023.DW.guide_lakes.html">Guide to the Lakes</ref>
                     </title> 
                that Nicholas Mason and Paul Westover, in collaboration with students and colleagues at Brigham
                Young University (BYU), published in 2015 and revised and expanded in 2020. While
                investigating the textual history of the five distinct editions of William’s
                <title level="m">Guide</title>, we were routinely struck by his sister’s crucial, if
                largely unacknowledged, contributions. This led us to ponder what a “Guide to the
                Lakes” written entirely by Dorothy might look like, a question we soon took up with
                Michelle Levy of Simon Fraser University (SFU), a fellow Romanticist who had worked
                extensively with Dorothy’s manuscripts in researching her articles and books on
                women’s writing, manuscript culture, and family authorship.</p>
                  <p>As we three began seriously considering how we might reverse engineer such a
                “guidebook” from Dorothy’s writings on the Lakes, we turned to Jeff Cowton, the
                longtime curator at the Wordsworth Trust, and several BYU and SFU students who had
                worked with the Wordsworths’ manuscripts while interning or studying in Grasmere.
                The result has been a collaborative process of over seven years, in which the three
                lead editors have worked with the Wordsworth Trust and student researchers to study,
                transcribe, and contextualize Dorothy’s works. Although, in their final forms, the
                critical apparatus and texts to follow were primarily authored or edited by an
                experienced scholar—with Michelle Levy leading out on the Grasmere Journal excerpts,
                the Greens narrative, and the poems; Paul Westover on the Ullswater and Scafell Pike
                excursions; and Nicholas Mason on the <title level="m">Rydal Journals</title>—every
                part of this edition has been deeply collaborative.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For a

                  <p>In the early stages of this project, we informally called it <title level="a">Dorothy Wordsworth’s
                Guide to the Lakes.</title> But, not wanting to confuse readers or perpetuate the image of
                Dorothy invariably following in her older brother’s footsteps, we eventually settled
                on the less allusive <title level="a">Dorothy Wordsworth’s Lake District.</title>
                Whatever its liabilities, however, our working title still encapsulates our vision of
                gathering and showcasing Dorothy’s vivid portraits of this famously picturesque
                region, which ultimately became Lake District National Park (1951) and a UNESCO World
                Heritage Site (2017). Strictly speaking, apart from the substantial sections she supplied
                for William’s <title level="m">Guide</title>, Dorothy never composed guidebook material
                as such.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For details on DW’s contributions to WW’s

                In fact, in an amusing 1803 letter to her friend Catherine Clarkson, she ranted, “I
                think journals of Tours except as far as one is interested in the travellers are
                very uninteresting. Wretched, wretched writing!”

                It’s all the more ironic, then, that travel writing—along with the notes, letters,
                and diary entries inspired by walks closer to home—would become central to her creative
                output and legacy. Works based on her experiences as a traveler or short-term resident
                include her journals from Alfoxden and Germany (both 1798), her <title level="m">
                Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland</title> (1803–1806), her <title level="m">
                Journal of a Tour on the Continent</title> (1820), her second tour of Scotland (1822),
                and large segments of the <title level="m">Rydal Journals</title>
                written on the road. While these texts encompass various literary traditions—nature
                diary, weather journal, travelogue, commonplace book, and so forth—they cohere as
                records of things observed and felt by a writer who, left to her own devices, would
                often walk over a dozen miles a day. Even when at home in Cumbria and drawing on
                daily experience, Dorothy might say, as Thoreau would years later, that she had
                “traveled a good deal” in the Lake District.</p>

                Thoreau, <title level="m">Walden</title>, 6.</note>
                  <p>Tellingly, we are not the first to note that both William and Dorothy serve as
                “guides” to the Lakes. Eric Sutherland Robertson, for instance, asked in his 1911
                book <title level="m">Wordsworthshire</title>, “Who wrote the noblest Guide to the
                Lakes—William or Dorothy? Let the reader study every page of the [Grasmere] Journal
                and of the other work before attempting to decide.”
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">Robertson, <title level="m">Wordsworthshire</title>,
                252.</note> As Robertson implies, while the brother’s poetry has undoubtedly shaped
                our perceptions of the Lake District, it has become equally impossible for the well-read
                traveler to imagine “Wordsworth Country” without considering Dorothy’s writing.</p>

                  <p>Our edition aims to bolster Dorothy’s growing reputation as one of the great
                chroniclers of this, or any, British region’s history and geography, people and

                excluded works that are set in or focused upon areas outside the Lakes (for
                instance, her tours of Scotland and the Continent and several sections of her
                <title level="m">Rydal Journals</title>). Even then, however, there were more than
                enough texts to choose from for an edition of this scope, which forced us to leave
                several brilliant descriptions of the region on the cutting-room floor. Dorothy’s
                letters alone, for instance, with their recurring effusions on the joys of rambling
                throughout Westmorland fells and dales, could easily supply enough content for a

                “What a heart and what a head they discover!” and contemplated all the celebrated
                authors “whose thinkings and feelings are not to be compared with hers!”
                (Letter to Henry Crabb Robinson, in Robinson, <title level="m">Diary, Reminiscences, and
                Correspondence</title>, 3:35).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Each section of this edition features a separate critical and editorial introduction
                and extensive illustrations and contextual materials, including manuscript
                facsimiles, maps, photographs, and biographical indices. Together, these resources
                offer a rich, multimodal vision of Dorothy Wordsworth’s writing life and the Lake
                District home she loved. The texts we ultimately selected can be grouped as follows:</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>While Dorothy’s entries from her early years at Dove Cottage are already the
                    most familiar of her writings, the first of her four Grasmere journal notebooks
                    is reintroduced here in an unfamiliar format. Specifically, we offer a
                    diplomatic transcription of this first notebook, presenting it in its raw
                    manuscript form to highlight both its material context and the complexity of
                    Dorothy’s writing practices. This notebook covers the seven months between 14
                    May and 22 December 1800, offering an intimate portrait of Westmorland life at
                    the moment when the Wordsworths returned to the area for good. It also captures
                    Dorothy’s love for walking, all but inviting us along on her daily rambles
                    through the Lakes.</p>

                  <p>In this moving account, written to raise money for children orphaned by a tragic
                    accident, Dorothy offers a chapter of local history. Widely circulated in
                    manuscript, her chronicle of poverty, grief, and community relief efforts
                    highlights the informal social contract binding together people of all classes
                    in the valleys of the Central Lakes. This public-facing text also complicates
                    our understanding of Dorothy’s motives for writing, conceptions of audience, and
                    views about publication.</p>

                  <p>Abridged versions of Dorothy’s accounts of excursions she made with friends to different
                    parts of the Lake District were among her earliest published writings, appearing
                    (albeit without acknowledgment of her authorship) in the 1822 and 1823 editions
                    of her brother’s <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title>. Showcasing Dorothy’s
                    gifts for nature writing and her indefatigability as a Lakeland fell-walker and
                    mountaineer, these important texts represent Dorothy’s most direct contributions
                    to Lake District travel literature. While long available in print, they have
                    never before been annotated, illustrated, or contextualized as thoroughly as
                    they are here. This edition also details the accounts’ complex textual histories
                    and brings Dorothy’s adventures to life with a pair of interactive maps.</p>

                  <p>Though Dorothy was self-effacing about her poetic abilities, verse became an
                    important genre for her, especially in later years. This is evidenced by what
                    the Wordsworth Trust labels her Commonplace Book (DCMS 120), which, along with
                    miscellaneous extracts and quotations, includes copies of most of her known
                    poems. Many of these poems, moreover, appear in multiple versions, thereby
                    displaying how serious she was about reworking and recopying them. Besides
                    offering a diplomatic transcription of all of the verse in DCMS 120, whether
                    complete poems or fragments, this section also includes an introductory essay on
                    what we can learn from Dorothy’s poetry manuscripts and multiple “Tables of
                    Contents” modelling different sequences in which the poems might be
                    studied.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>Despite the renown of Dorothy’s earlier journals, most of the 15 notebooks
                    recording her daily life between 1824 and 1835 remain unpublished. This
                    edition’s annotated texts of the first and last volumes of her
                    <title level="m">Rydal Journals</title> therefore represent a
                    watershed of sorts in offering a wealth of new perspectives on Dorothy’s daily
                    life in late middle age. Both notebooks included here reflect an abiding
                    affinity for the scenery and inhabitants of the Lakes; but, whereas Notebook 1
                    captures a period marked by boundless energy, Notebook 15 finds her confined to
                    a sickbed, reminiscing over past excursions and taking in whatever sights and
                    sounds she can from her upstairs room at Rydal Mount.</p>

                  <p>In 1995, when “electronic edition” still had a futuristic ring and even the most
                inclusive of syllabi were constrained by which noncanonical texts were readily
                available in print, Marilyn Butler issued a call for scholars and publishers to
                prioritize producing high-quality yet affordable editions of important works by
                women. “We must have true scholarly editions of a significant body of women’s
                writing,” she argued, “not only to grasp the internal dynamics of an individual
                career, but to understand its group dynamics, its inter-relations with society and
                history.” Merely reprinting an old poem, play, or novel wasn’t enough, as “we
                mustn’t underrate how much a good edition adds to a ‘raw’ text—far more, indeed, if
                it’s discreetly presented than most readers retain much consciousness of.” Even a
                rudimentary critical apparatus, Butler suggested, tends to make us take a text more
                seriously, as there is an inherent aura to a work that comes shrouded in a “penumbra
                of knowledge, biographical, textual, intertextual and extra-textual.”

                  </p>
                  <p>Around the time of Butler’s appeal, many important new editions of Romantic women’s
                writing did, in fact, appear in print. Since then digital publication has emerged as
                a key avenue for publishing women’s writing of the period, with the web offering key
                advantages over print for representing full-color, high-quality images of
                manuscripts and also for rendering diplomatic transcriptions. In the present
                instance, publishing on Romantic Circles offers a stable, open-access, and
                peer-reviewed platform that adheres to the editorial standards of the best print
                series while also facilitating web-specific features like hypertext links and
                high-resolution galleries of illustrations and manuscript pages.
                </p>
                  <p>Whether publishing in print or online, editors of Romantic-era women writers face
                particular challenges. Researchers studying most women writers lack the trove of
                archived manuscripts, letters, and notebooks that have been used to make modern
                editions of male Romantic writers the gold standard for exhaustively researched,
                copiously annotated, theoretically informed, and editorially inventive critical
                texts. Thus, while the trailblazing textual scholarship of Romanticists like Neil
                Fraistat, Jerome McGann, Donald Reiman, Charles Robinson, and Jack Stillinger has
                reinvigorated the field of scholarly editing, their weighty volumes have sometimes
                left editors of the period’s women writers uncertain how to follow suit.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Other influential modern editors of the 
                        male Romantics include contributors to the monumental Cornell edition 
                        of WW, the Princeton edition of Coleridge, and the 
                        <title level="m">William Blake Archive</title>.
                    </note> 
                As Daniel Robinson has observed in relation to his own edition of the writing of Mary
                Robinson, “the relationship of the previously neglected woman writer to the canon may 
                be forever tenuous due to the nature of the archive, and this determines the work an 
                editor can do. The quality of an edition, therefore, is contingent upon, in effect, 
                the quality of the archive.”
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Robinson, “Mary Robinson’s Poetry,” 53.</note> 
                For many women of the period, the archive consists mainly or exclusively of print editions.
                Therefore, with a few notable exceptions, those producing editions of women Romantic
                writers lack primary resources. This is true even for those working on writers like
                the prolific Ann Radcliffe or ultra-canonical Jane Austen, for whom we have only one
                manuscript fragment from her six printed novels.

                  <p>With Dorothy Wordsworth, however, the opposite is true. She is a writer who published
                little in her lifetime, especially under her own name, but who left behind a wealth
                of manuscripts. Several of her works survive in multiple manuscript versions, almost
                all of which are conveniently archived at the Wordsworth Trust and, since 2012,
                available digitally through Adam Matthew’s <title level="m">Romanticism: Life,
                Literature, and Landscape</title> database. Moreover, unlike most of her female
                contemporaries’, Dorothy’s writing has, since the Victorian age, been admired,
                edited, and even re-edited by a series of leading scholars.
                </p>
                  <p>Four years before Dorothy’s death, excerpts from her
                <title level="m">Grasmere Journals</title> first appeared under
                her name in <title level="m">Memoirs of William Wordsworth</title>, the biography her
                nephew Christopher Wordsworth Jr. published in the wake of the poet’s death.
                Twenty-three years later, Principal J. C. Shairp’s 1874 edition of her 
                <title level="m">Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland A.D. 1803</title> proved so
                popular that it went into a third edition within a year. Then, in 1889, the
                preeminent Wordsworthian of late-Victorian England, William Knight, published the
                most extensive selections from Dorothy’s Alfoxden, Hamburg, and Grasmere journals to
                date in his eleven-volume <title level="m">Life of William Wordsworth</title> (1889).
                Knight soon republished these excerpts, along with several more from her travel
                narratives and “mountain rambles,” in his landmark two-volume 
                <title level="m">Journals of Dorothy Wordsworth</title> (1897). This was the standard Dorothy
                Wordsworth edition until 1941, when Ernest de Sélincourt, the great Wordsworth
                editor of the early twentieth century, released his own two-volume edition of her
                journals. (De Sélincourt, like Knight before him, began by working on William’s
                writings but soon became one of Dorothy’s champions.) Although only minimally
                contextualized and annotated, and devoid of any detailed analysis of conflicting
                versions and other textual concerns, De Sélincourt’s <title level="m">Journals of
                Dorothy Wordsworth</title> remains in many respects the closest thing to a proper
                scholarly edition of Dorothy’s prose works.
                </p>
                  <p>Another breakthrough moment for the study of Dorothy Wordsworth, and arguably for
                Romantic women writers more broadly, came in 1974, when the Romanticism section in
                the third edition of the <title level="m">Norton Anthology of English
                Literature</title>, edited by M. H. Abrams, admitted her into what had previously
                been an all-male club. Yet, even while introducing excerpts from the 
                <title level="m">Grasmere Journals</title>, the anthology signaled that Dorothy’s
                inclusion had less to do with the intrinsic merits of her writing than with the
                light they shed on the domestic and writing life of her famous poet-brother.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors"> This enduring sense of DW’s writings being 
                        more useful as secondary than primary sources partly explains the early, 
                        persistent, and, at times, exclusive focus on those passages from her 
                        <title level="m">Grasmere Journals</title> that capture peak moments in 
                        WW’s and Coleridge’s poetic careers.
                    </note> 
                 Of course, the <title level="m">Norton Anthology</title> was hardly the first to treat 
                 her journals as, above all, a study aid for the masterpieces composed by men of the 
                 “Wordsworth circle.” Knight, for instance, notoriously justified abridging her journals 
                 by explaining that they “contain numerous trivial details” and contending, “there is no 
                 need to record all the cases in which the sister wrote, ‘Today I mended William’s shirts,’ 
                 or ‘William gathered sticks,’ or ‘I went in search of eggs,’ etc. etc.” He preferred 
                 passages that would cast “a flood of light on the circumstances under which her brother’s
                 poems were composed.”
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <title level="m">KJ</title>, 1:vii–viii, x.</note> 
                 And while De Sélincourt was well ahead of his time when he declared that “Dorothy Wordsworth is
                 probably the most remarkable and the most distinguished of English writers who never
                 wrote a line for the general public,”
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <title level="m">DWJ</title>, 1:v.</note>
                the critical apparatus to his edition of her journals perpetuated the tradition of
                placing heaviest emphasis on moments when her writings might illuminate William’s
                life and works. Furthermore, his claim that Dorothy never wrote for the public
                demands some scrutiny, for although she rarely wrote with publication directly in
                view, she knew that much of what she wrote would be absorbed by William and
                published by him.
                </p>
                  <p>With the late twentieth-century feminist turn in literary studies, however, scholars
                began to be newly attuned to Dorothy’s distinctive gifts, and to the audience that
                her writing garnered, even in her lifetime. Susan Levin’s <title level="m">Dorothy
                Wordsworth and Romanticism</title> (1987) was a breakthrough moment in this
                respect, as it at once made a persuasive case for revaluing Dorothy’s life and work
                and, in its latter half, offered the first anthology of her poems. Likewise,
                successive Oxford World’s Classics versions of <title level="m">The Grasmere and
                Alfoxden Journals</title>, beginning with Helen Darbishire’s pocket-sized edition
                of 1958 and culminating in Pamela Woof’s masterful edition of 2001, treated
                Dorothy’s diaries as “classics” worthy of meticulous presentation and generous
                annotation. When the 2001 edition appeared, Nicola Trott rightfully celebrated how
                Woof “establishes the full independence of Dorothy Wordsworth as a writer” and
                “makes it abundantly clear that Dorothy’s writing was not merely fodder for his
                [William’s] own, nor indeed was it about him, except in so far as he entered a
                narrative already crowded with incident and observation.”

                  <p>As in Woof’s edition, Dorothy is the undisputed protagonist of this Romantic Circles
                electronic edition of her writings on the Lake District. To a degree matched only by
                Levin’s 2009 Longman Cultural Edition, our 
                <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.contents.html">table of contents</ref> strays
                from the beaten path in including a range of lesser-known and even previously
                unpublished works demonstrating her abilities in multiple genres and stages of life.
                Moreover, excepting Woof, no previous editors have contextualized and annotated
                Dorothy’s works as thoroughly as we have here, and we pay unprecedented attention to
                the material forms of her texts and what they can teach us about the nature of her
                writing process, literary sociability, and intended audiences.

                  <p>At a moment of belt-tightening in academic publishing in the humanities, a 
                 scholarly edition with this level of breadth and detail is increasingly 
                 imaginable only in the digital realm, where editors face fewer 
                 constraints in matters of length, layout, and illustration. Since the 
                 earliest online editions appeared in the mid-1990s, the best examples 
                 of the genre have appreciated and capitalized on the distinctive advantages 
                 of this new medium. As a case in point, the digital version of Charles Robinson’s 
                 <ref target="http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/contents/frankenstein/">
                        <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> Notebooks</ref> published two decades ago 
                 in the Shelley-Godwin Archive remains an essential resource. On a platform 
                 available to anyone with an internet connection, it offers high-resolution 
                 images of Mary Shelley’s manuscripts and scrupulous transcriptions, which 
                 combine to present the material contexts of this novel’s production and 
                 circulation in an entirely new light. Similarly, the
                 <ref target="https://www.edickinson.org/">Emily Dickinson Archive</ref> 
                 deploys digital tools to re-present a manuscript writer 
                 whose poetry has consistently been distorted by print mediations.
                 </p>
                  <p>Following in the footsteps of leading digital editors, we have designed 
                 this edition to showcase the challenges of rendering Dorothy’s manuscripts 
                 into typographic characters. Thanks to the Wordsworth Trust’s generosity, 
                 we provide dozens of scans of the original manuscripts, providing many 
                 opportunities to compare them to our transcriptions. As the digitized pages 
                 from her notebooks make readily apparent, Dorothy often wrote to the moment, 
                 particularly when journaling, and did not always come back to revise or create 
                 fair copies. When necessary, she wrote in a neat, legible hand; otherwise, as 
                 readers of her letters know, she usually preferred to apologize for her 
                 “bad habit of scrawling” rather than labor over every word.

                     </note> 
                 Consequently, merely transcribing some of her more private texts, like her

                 Journals</ref>, presents countless editorial dilemmas.
                 </p>
                  <p>Dorothy’s poems pose different challenges, as many survive in multiple 
                 drafts that are rife with variants. Since she published only a handful 
                 of these poems and did not regularly identify or collect final versions, 
                 no one manuscript can be said to have authority over another. Still 
                 other texts, like <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.Greens-intro.html">
                 “A Narrative Concerning George &amp; Sarah Green”</ref> and 
                 <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.Ulls-intro.html">“Excursion on the Banks of

                 </p>
                  <p>Given such variations, we have been ecumenical in our editorial approach. As detailed
                in our introductions to specific sections, we have tried to tailor our digital
                presentation and editorial methodology to the distinctive features of individual
                texts and manuscripts. For instance, recognizing the challenges of engaging with the
                fragmentary and allusive <title level="m">Rydal Journals</title> without a familiarity
                with Dorothy’s world ca. 1825–1835, we supplement our transcriptions with detailed
                contextual introductions, indexes of key people and places, and hundreds of
                hyperlinked endnotes. In contrast, with Woof and others having already thoroughly
                annotated the <title level="m">Grasmere Journals</title>, we instead opt to provide a
                diplomatic transcription of the first of the four notebooks, emphasizing Dorothy’s
                revisions and the manuscript’s physical characteristics. And for her Lakeland
                “excursions,” we include interactive maps and dozens of illustrations to create a
                stronger sense of geography and material circumstances. In sum, we trust that
                editorial flexibility reflects Dorothy Wordsworth’s own flexibility and variety as a
                writer.
                 </p>
                  <p>Just as we have tried to adopt best practices from earlier digital editions, we have
                followed the lead of pioneering editors of women’s writing in questioning the
                conventional belief that, as W. W. Greg put it in 1954, the editor’s task is “to
                present the text, so far as the available evidence permits, in the form in which we
                may suppose that it would have stood in a fair copy, made by the author himself, of
                the work as he finally intended it.”
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Greg, Editorial Problem, x.</note>
                Authorial intention is a notoriously vexed subject in critical theory—“final
                intention” perhaps even more so, not least because it depends on the often shaky
                assumption that “final” versions exist. Further, as McGann has argued, this
                traditional focus on final intentions rests upon notions of “the autonomy of the
                isolated author,” an arguably masculine construction that “has the effect of
                desocializing our historical view of the literary work.”
                     <note place="foot" resp="editors">McGann, <title level="m">Critique</title>, 8, 121.</note> 
                And Dorothy is an exemplary
                social writer, frequently customizing her texts for different readers and occasions
                and often writing in close collaboration with others. She frequently customized her
                texts for different readers and occasions. She also tended to leave multiple versions of
                texts side by side in her notebooks, making it all but impossible in many cases to
                determine her “final intentions.” The same facts make it impossible to adopt
                the tenets of an opposing philosophy of textual editing—one perhaps most famously
                embraced by the Cornell Wordsworth editors—that consistently privileges the earliest
                completed version. Even where the sequence of versions can be reconstructed in
                Dorothy’s notebooks—and usually it cannot—it is impossible to say that one version
                is better, more authoritative, or more important than another.
                 </p>
                  <p>Fortunately, the nature of this digital edition allows us in several cases to offer
                multiple versions of a text, leaving readers to interpret each on its own terms. In
                such instances, we apply principles from the modern “versioning” school of textual
                editing, which has perhaps been most effectively modeled by editors such as Mays and
                Stillinger, who have taken pains to reproduce multiple versions of poems by
                Coleridge and Keats. As Amy Culley and Anna F. Fitzer have suggested, this approach
                treats writing “as a collaborative and social product” and discerning authorial
                intent as “just one in a sequence of textual negotiations.”

                In its attempts to foreground the material, social, and geographical contexts of
                Dorothy’s writing, this edition also adopts key tenets of “the new textualism.” This
                approach, as described by Ann Hollinshead Hurley and Chanita Goodblatt, “focuses on
                the material properties of the manuscript or book, its print or performance history,
                and records of its dissemination.”
                     <note place="foot" resp="editors"> Hurley and Goodblatt, <title level="a">Preface,</title> xi.</note>
                Such an approach is necessary given the sociable contexts in which Dorothy wrote and
                circulated her writing.

                     <item>
                        <hi rend="bold">References to the author</hi>: We default
                    to the somewhat familiar “Dorothy” as an imperfect alternative to the
                    potentially confusing “Wordsworth” (which still tends to connote the brother) or
                    the clumsy repetition of both writers’ first and last names. Likewise, where
                    William Wordsworth appears in our apparatus, he becomes “William.” For the sake
                    of brevity, our endnotes use initials for Dorothy (DW), William (WW), and Mary
                    Wordsworth (MW), Sara Hutchinson (SH), and Samuel Taylor Coleridge (STC).
                    Endnotes reference William and Mary’s three surviving children (John, Dora, and
                    Willy) by first names only (see the list of <ref>Abbreviations of Commonly

                    overusing any one toponym, we use “the Lakes,” “the Lake District,” “Lakeland,”
                    and “Cumbria” interchangeably. In doing so, we are cognizant that the
                    Wordsworths would have considered themselves residents of “the Lakes” and
                    Westmorland but perhaps not of “the Lake District” (which, first gaining
                    traction in the 1820s, would have seemed a neologism) or “Cumbria” (which had
                    grown archaic). These latter labels became normative only in the latter half of
                    the twentieth century, after the formations of the “Lake District National Park”
                    in 1951 and County of Cumbria (encompassing the traditional counties of
                    Westmoreland and Cumberland and slivers of Lancashire and Yorkshire) in 1974.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors"> Note, however, that the popularity of 
                        the “Lake District,” both as a concept and as a toponym, was probably 
                        helped along by William Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title>, 
                        which from its 1835 edition forward had “District of the Lakes” in its title.

                    transcriptions strive to replicate Dorothy’s spelling and punctuation precisely.
                    When unconventional, inaccurate, or omitted punctuation in the manuscript might
                    produce confusion, we provide punctuation marks inside editorial brackets (e.g.,
                    [,]). While our reading texts preserve Dorothy’s variant or archaic renderings
                    of place names (e.g., “Ulswater” and “Scawfell”), our editorial apparatus
                    generally privileges modern spellings (e.g., “Ullswater” and “Scafell”).

                        <hi rend="bold">Titles</hi>: When Dorothy provided a
                    title for a text, we reproduce it. In many cases, however, she saw no need for
                    titles. For her unnamed poems, we have resisted the urge to offer standardized
                    titles, adopting instead the first line and placing it within brackets. For her
                    journals, also untitled, for ease of reference we use names commonly used by
                    scholars—that is, <title level="m">Grasmere Journals</title> and 
                    <title level="m">Rydal Journals</title>. This practice adheres to the norm of formatting
                    references to posthumously constructed texts (e.g.,
                    <title level="m">The Prelude</title> of 1805) identically to
                    those for lifetime editions (e.g.,
                    <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> of 1798). But when
                    referring to the physical manuscripts or to specific journal entries we use the
                    term “Grasmere journal notebooks” in acknowledgement of the fact that DW never
                    appears to have considered the four notebooks now known as the 
                    <title level="m">Grasmere Journals</title> a unified work. The fact that many teaching editions
                    extract her Grasmere entries from notebooks that also contain other materials
                    reminds us that “journals” are not necessarily identical with the manuscripts in
                    which they are found. Especially when referencing these early journals, then, we
                    attempt to distinguish between the text and its material instantiation on paper.

                    editors, as these serviceably describe their contents.

                I. Contexts
            </head>
                  <p>In this section, we present the entirety of Dorothy Wordsworth’s first Grasmere
                journal notebook, DCMS 20. This notebook includes entries for 172 days, from 14 May
                to 22 December 1800, as well as other miscellaneous material Dorothy copied into the
                pages. The contents of this single notebook are reproduced through diplomatic
                transcription, meaning that we record as closely as possible the appearance of the
                text in the original manuscript. Thus, we preserve all of Dorothy’s original
                spellings and abbreviations and her marks of revision (corrections, cancellations,
                substitutions) as well as, where possible, other nonlinguistic marks (such as lines
                she draws between some journal entries), in addition to her line and page breaks.
                There are multiple reasons for keeping editorial intervention to a minimum. By
                copying Dorothy’s words and punctuation as they appear on the page, we make her
                compositional processes more available to interpretation—processes that are often
                obscured in regularized edited versions of the journal. For example, her use of
                contractions, abbreviations, and ampersands suggests that she wrote in haste. For
                similar reasons, we include all of her journal entries rather than editorial
                selections. By reviewing each entry, it is possible to follow her daily routines as
                she recorded them, over a six-month period, without focusing on exceptional entries
                or events. The preservation of line breaks reminds readers of the diplomatic
                transcription of the small size of the notebook Dorothy used and the short nature of
                the entries themselves. In sum, this straightforward presentation supports
                understanding of the material practices and structures within which Dorothy wrote
                all four notebooks of her now-famous Grasmere journals.

                  <p>Dorothy and William Wordsworth were born (in 1771 and 1770, respectively) in
                Cockermouth, Cumberland (now Cumbria), about 25 miles northwest of Grasmere. They
                and their three brothers were separated after the death of their mother in 1778:
                Dorothy was sent to live with her mother’s cousin in Halifax, West Yorkshire (and
                later with other relatives), while William was sent with his brother Richard to
                Hawkshead Grammar School, six miles due south of Grasmere (see fig. 2.3). William
                and Dorothy did not see each other again for nine years. They were together briefly
                in 1787, before William went to Cambridge, and ultimately, they lived together in
                various residences from 1795 onward, first in Racedown, Dorsetshire, and then in
                Alfoxden, Somerset, southwest of Bristol. On 17 December 1799 (after a cold winter
                spent in Goslar, Germany), brother and sister moved to Town End, Grasmere, adopting
                the home now known as Dove Cottage. They would live in Grasmere and the nearby
                village of Rydal (see fig. 2.3) for the rest of their lives. The first surviving
                journal of their time after returning to live in the Lakes, Dorothy’s first Grasmere
                journal was begun on 14 May 1800, in a very small notebook (at 15 x 9.5 cm, it is
                only slightly larger than an iPhone 8), now known as DCMS 20.
            </p>
                  <p>The entries in this journal notebook therefore offer the first glimpses into the
                siblings’ lives after returning to the Lake District, covering the second half of
                their first year in Grasmere and tracing Dorothy’s activities as they set up their
                own household and began, for the first time, to live on their own terms. It was an
                important period for the Wordsworths, a moment that combined a sense of homecoming
                with experiences of dislocation and itinerancy. At least in this first year, they
                were not quite locals, though they were not quite tourists either. Upon moving to
                Grasmere, Dorothy and William began the practical labor of creating a home for
                themselves, as they improved their cottage and garden; made new friendships,
                particularly with two families resident nearby, the Simpsons and the Lloyds;
                nourished old intimacies, especially with the Coleridges and the Hutchinsons;
                reacquainted themselves with Lakeland ways; and walked everywhere, having no other
                means of transportation and being devoted to pedestrianism as a form of recreation
                and exploration. The journal also reports on an essential period of their shared
                literary life, as William composed poetry for the second volume of the second
                edition of <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> (1800) and as brother and sister
                prepared the volume for the press.
            </p>
                  <p>The opening entry in the journal (see fig. 2.1 for its first page and fig. 2.2 for
                pages 4 and 5) is dramatic. In it, Dorothy takes up her pen after the departure of
                her two brothers, John and William, to visit Mary, Sara, and Tom Hutchinson in their
                new home in Yorkshire. John, a sailor, had come to live with Dorothy and William in
                January 1800, after an eight-year separation. William and Dorothy knew the
                Hutchinsons from Penrith, where Dorothy had gone to live with her maternal
                grandparents as a 16-year-old. William met the Hutchinsons during school holidays;
                and he would later marry Mary Hutchinson, in October 1802. All of this context
                informs our reading of this first entry, which begins with an emotional intensity
                that is not often repeated. Dorothy finds herself overwhelmed upon saying goodbye to
                William (“My heart was so full that I could hardly speak to W when I gave him a
                farewell kiss”); she describes the “flood of tears” that follows and ends the entry
                with a wish for a letter from her brother (“Oh! that I had a letter from William!”),
                even though he has only just left. The entry is also remarkable for its length (at
                450 words, it is the longest entry that does not involve Dorothy trying to catch up
                on multiple days) and because, in it, Dorothy describes herself in the present
                moment of journal writing (“It is nine o’clock, I shall soon go to bed.”). Normally,
                her journal is retrospective, but in key instances Dorothy writes to the moment.

                  <p>To be sure, she would discover additional uses for the journal over time (just
                as she had prior uses, as is evidenced in the sums found at the top of fig. 2.1),
                but here she frames her resolution to keep it primarily as a means of consoling
                herself for the grief she feels at the departure of her brothers (“because I will
                not quarrel with myself”) and as a gift for William upon his return, presumably
                because it will allow him to share in her daily activities, thoughts, and
                encounters. The speed with which Dorothy wrote this and most of her other entries is
                apparent in pages 4 and 5 of her first journal entry (fig. 2.2). Notice, for
                instance, her use of abbreviations (W and W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> for
                William, J for John); in the cancellation of “my,” possibly because it was written
                too close to the previous word, followed by her rewriting “myself”; and in the
                deleted and undecipherable word in the middle of page 4. The minuteness of the
                notebook is also apparent in the very short lines (most have only five to seven
                words) and in the formation of letters, which though legible are often far from
                neat.

                  <p>Within this first entry, we see how Dorothy’s stated aims coalesce. The act of
                recording her daily activities offers her solace for her loneliness and allows her
                to reflect on the productive nature of her days, spent working in the house and
                garden, reading and writing, visiting with friends, and walking. These activities
                follow the daily rhythms of life: the chores necessary to run a household, such as
                washing and mending, as well as those tasks she seems to have taken special pleasure
                in, such as gathering plants and flowers for her garden. At the end of the first
                entry, for example, Dorothy reports, “Arrived at home with a bad head-ach – set some
                slips of privett. The evening cold – had a fire – my face now flame-coloured.” This
                entry offers a foretaste of the descriptions to come, as she enumerates her daily
                household chores, all undertaken with a bad headache on a cold May day, after a long
                and emotionally draining walk. Throughout this notebook, we learn that Dorothy had
                help with some chores, as she mentions her neighbors from the cottage across the
                road, John Fisher; his wife, Aggy (Agnes); and his sister Molly (Mary) Fisher.
                Pamela Woof notes that Molly was paid two shillings a week “to clean, light fires,
                wash dishes, prepare vegetables, do the weekly small clothes wash, and the 5-weekly
                ‘great wash.’”

                  </p>
                  <p>Still, Dorothy had “a good deal” to do (in her own oft-repeated phrase)—ironing,
                baking, weeding—work that was physically demanding and time-consuming but that also
                represented acceptable forms of labor for a middle-class woman. The kitchen
                garden was an important source of food, such as peas and turnips, and it is evident
                that much effort was needed to grow and harvest these crops, as it was more
                generally to manage a home at the beginning of the nineteenth century, in one of the
                wettest parts of England, with minimal help from servants. She also engaged in
                shoemaking, wallpapering, and mattress making, with one mattress being sent to the
                Coleridges in Keswick. Dorothy took delight and pride in her pleasure garden, and
                she transplanted the mosses, plants, and flowers that she gathered on her walks or
                bought from others. When William returned on 7 June, they stayed up until 4:00 a.m.
                “so he had an opportunity of seeing [their] improvements” when the sun came up, and
                she expressed satisfaction two days later when a party in “a coronetted Landau [a
                luxury carriage bearing an insignia of the nobility] . . . (evidently tourists)
                turned an eye of interest upon [their] little garden &amp; cottage.”

            </head>
                  <p>Dorothy’s encounter with tourists traveling by landau contrasts strongly with her own
                pedestrianism. The Wordsworths had no horse or carriage in their early Grasmere days
                and got around on foot. Indeed, perhaps most striking to the modern reader of DCMS
                20 is the centrality of walking to Dorothy’s daily life, an activity that brought
                her into close contact with a landscape she loved, with friends and family (with and
                to whom she often walked), and with the local farmers and shepherds, beggars, and
                itinerant laborers who also traversed the public roads and footpaths. Indeed, walking emerges as
                an organizing feature of her (and her brother’s) daily life. She repeatedly speaks
                about going out for “[her] walk,” suggesting that it is the walk itself—the physical
                activity and the opportunity it allows for experiencing her natural
                surroundings—that serves as the prime motivator for the activity. She rambles
                through almost all weather, in all seasons, in rain and snow, by moon and starlight,
                often not returning home until late in the evening. Dorothy was proud of her skill
                and endurance as a walker. On 18 May, she notes, “I was overtaken by 2 Cumberland
                people on the other side of Rydale who complimented me upon my walking.” In most
                entries, Dorothy takes care to describe all of these activities: whether and where
                she has walked, her household chores, her engagement in sociable activities, and her
                participation in intellectual and literary work such as reading, copying, writing
                letters, and, of course, keeping her journal. As the record of an indefatigable
                pedestrian and a young, single woman interested in the lives and livelihood of
                others of all ages and social classes, the journal provides its readers with a tour,
                informal and unplotted as it is, as well as with commentary on the Lake District’s
                topography and ecology, and on the life—social, economic, intellectual, creative—of
                those who live there.
            </p>
                  <p>Within the lengthy first entry for 14 May 1800, Dorothy records the walk she takes
                (after parting with her brothers at the shores of Lake Windermere), including the
                route she took and her observations along the way. She describes three encounters
                with individuals as she walks along the public roads: with a blind man driving
                bulls, with a poor woman from Rydal who begs a half penny, and with a young woman
                from Manchester who has buried three children and a husband in a pauper’s grave.
                Walking thus affords Dorothy opportunities for encountering both nature and human
                nature, and these experiences weave throughout the journal. (Some of them, famously,
                reappear in William’s poems.) The Rydal woman tells Dorothy that she has never
                begged before but has been forced to do so because of these “hard times.” The
                representation of poor men, women, and children, many of whom are homeless and
                itinerant and forced to beg, whom she meets on her walks and at her door (Dove
                Cottage was then on the main road, so it was a usual place for those passing through
                to stop and beg for money or food), attest to the economic dislocations of
                industrialization and war affecting England at the start of the new century.
            </p>
                  <p>Dorothy’s record of and response to the speech, appearance, and actions of these
                distressed people form an important aspect of her journal. She often reflects on the
                residents of the vale and how they too are adversely affected by the “hard times.”
                On 18 May, she quotes her neighbor, John Fisher, who expresses concern “about the
                alteration in the times,” observing “that in a short time there would be only two
                ranks of people, the very rich &amp; the very poor, for those who have small estates
                says he are forced to sell, &amp; all the land goes into one hand.” Several years
                later, she would address the dire circumstances of small landowners in 
                <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.Greens-intro.html">

                Grasmere addressed to a Friend</title> (1808)</ref>. In her journal entries and 
                elsewhere, we find Dorothy expressing her awareness of and sympathy for the suffering
                of those around her, as well as her desire to voice their concerns. Indeed, her walking
                could itself be seen as an act of solidarity with the poor.
            </p>
                  <p>Rarely is there an entry in this notebook that does not mention walking. Even when
                she does not walk, an explanation is usually given for why it has not been possible
                to do so (the reasons are illness, visitors, or severe weather). Of the 172 days
                recorded in the journal, Dorothy reports walking on 125, or 73 percent of the total.
                On 37 of these days, she reports walking two or three times. Some of these walks are
                left unspecified, such as on 23 November, when we are simply told, “Sarah &amp; I
                walked after dinner.” However, on many if not most days, it is possible to have a
                much more precise sense of where she goes. Many of Dorothy’s walks are solitary
                rambles, but, as noted previously, few days go by without Dorothy visiting or being
                visited by her friends.
            </p>
                  <p>The 1818 map detailed in figure 2.3, with Grasmere in the near center (and Dove
                Cottage marked by the rectangle on the road to east of the lake), enables us to
                better visualize her daily walks, which moved in every direction from her home. One
                frequent destination was the town of Ambleside, to the south, where mail was
                delivered and picked up, a distance of about four miles each way. Often, she
                describes taking the route to Ambleside via Clappersgate. In November 1800, Charles
                Lloyd, his wife, Mary, his sister Priscilla, and their children moved to Old
                Brathay, southwest of Ambleside (denoted as “Brathay” on the map), and Dorothy
                visited them frequently. Clappersgate and Brathay are at the head of Lake
                Windermere, and it was just south of there, at Low Wood on the eastern shore, that
                Dorothy parted from William and John as reported in her first journal entry.

                  <p>More westerly is Langdale, the neighboring vale, under the mountains known as the
                Langdale Pikes. Dorothy reports walking to Langdale on three occasions (16 and 23
                June and 7 September): on 16 June she mentions visiting Collath (Colwith) and
                Skelleth (Skelwith), also visible on the map, and on 23 June she describes seeing
                Elterwater. She “peeps” into Langdale valley, by climbing around Loughrigg, one of
                the fells to the south of Grasmere, another two times (30 August and 4 December). To
                the south and east and closer to home are the neighboring village of Rydal and lake
                of the same name; and there are also the hills behind Dove Cottage, where Dorothy
                acquires mosses and plants.
            </p>
                  <p>Figure 2.4, from the same map, takes a wider view to include the area north of
                Grasmere. In July 1800, Samuel Taylor Coleridge had moved to Keswick, to be nearer
                to the Wordsworths, his new home at Greta Hall being about 13 miles northeast of
                Grasmere (along what was known as the Keswick Road, which passed over Dunmail Raise,
                denoted as “Raise” on the map but spelled as “Rays” by Dorothy). Dorothy walked to
                Keswick at least three times in the six-month period described in this notebook, in
                August, November, and finally in December, when her journal entry mentions “snow
                upon the ground.” On 17 November 1800, she records the time it took for her to walk
                from Dove Cottage to Keswick for this second trip of the year: “Set off at 5 minutes
                past 10, &amp; arrived at ½ past 2.” Thus, she covers about three miles per hour,
                walking uphill much of the way. Much closer to Grasmere but along the same road is
                the village of Wythburn, a common turning-around point for Dorothy when she
                accompanies William on the first part of his journeys to Keswick. Dorothy also
                frequently walks to Wythburn, the home of Miss Elizabeth Jane Simpson and her
                father, the Reverend Joseph Simpson, vicar of the village’s small church.
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors"> Wythburn Church still stands, but most of the small 
                        community it served was destroyed when the Thirlmere Reservoir was created in 1894.
                        </note>
                Elizabeth was near in age to Dorothy (Dorothy was 29, Elizabeth about 33, in 1800), and the
                distance between their homes was about 1.5 miles. To the northwest, even closer to home, is
                Easedale valley, often referred to by the Wordsworths as the “Black Quarter”—a
                favorite place for their walks; one can also see “Helm [Crag]” on the map, the
                iconic local fell that looks over Grasmere and Easedale, mentioned frequently in the journal
                along with other surrounding hills.

                  <p>To some extent, Dorothy’s walking habits depend on who is at Dove Cottage with her.
                After William’s return from his visit to Penrith, her routine changes slightly; she
                describes less wandering and more fishing on the lake. When she has company, such as
                during the extended, 3½-week visit with the Coleridges in July or Coleridge’s visit
                alone in December, she stops writing in her journal, so we learn less about her
                walking during those periods (see figure 2.6). When Coleridge comes, Dorothy appears
                to be excluded from some longer and more arduous walks undertaken by the men—for
                instance, Coleridge, brother John, and William climb Helvellyn (England’s
                third-highest mountain), Seat Sandal, and the path to Stickle Tarn (Langdale)
                without her. All three destinations may be seen in figure 2.4. It is not clear why
                Dorothy did not accompany the men on these 1800 walks. She would not be left out for
                long. By late 1801, she had attempted Fairfield and reached the summit of Helvellyn.
                We know from <title level="m">A Narrative concerning George &amp; Sarah Green</title> that
                by 1808 she had been to Stickle Tarn. In short, Dorothy would make these ascents
                (and many others) in the years to come.

                  <p>Examining and closely reading a single notebook allows us to understand the
                centrality of walking to Dorothy Wordsworth. Walking was important for her physical
                and mental health. Certainly, it invested her with a strong sense of independence
                and personal worth. Many of Dorothy’s later travel narratives also describe her mode
                of travel as chiefly pedestrian, reflecting the profound importance that walking had
                for her writing. Furthermore, Dorothy’s inability to walk later in life, when beset
                by illness, became the subject of one her most celebrated poems, “Thoughts on my
                sickbed” <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-overview.html">(see Section 7 of this edition)</ref>.

            </head>
                  <p>Like most diarists, Dorothy sometimes gets behind, and she writes at highly variable
                levels of detail. Sometimes she composes retrospectively, and at other times she
                writes to the moment. In the first entry, as we have seen, she writes in the
                present, and also on 3 September: “– writing my journal now at 8 o clock.” On 19
                October, we seem to catch her writing in installments within a single entry: “We are
                not to dine till 4 o clock ––– Dined at ½ past 5.” Additionally, there are many
                indications, both direct and indirect, that Dorothy did not consistently write her
                entries on the day she describes. In an undated entry after 13 September, she notes,
                “Here I have long neglected my Journal” and inserts a compensatory entry covering
                the period from 19 to 30 September. An earlier example appears between 25 June and
                26 July. Beneath the entry for 25 June, Dorothy reports that the Coleridges arrived
                on Sunday, 29 June and stayed for over three weeks, departing on Thursday, 24 July
                (Dorothy mistakes this date as 23 July). In other words, we have a gap of five days.
                Moreover, in this catch-up entry, Dorothy provides an extremely truncated account of
                the Coleridges’ visit. All we learn about this 26-day period (Sunday, June 29 to
                Thursday, July 24) is that on the Friday before her friends’ departure, the group
                took tea on the island (in Grasmere); that on the Sunday before they had tea in
                Bainriggs with the Simpsons, Dorothy accompanied Sara Coleridge to Wythburn; and
                that the weather was hot. We see a similar brevity at play when Coleridge visits in
                December (there is a gap between 4 and 15 December; see fig. 2.6) and when Dorothy
                travels to Keswick, between 9–16 August and 10–14 December. Sometimes, we conclude,
                she was just too busy to write.
            </p>
                  <p>The <title level="m">Grasmere Journals</title> have long been read for the way they
                illuminate the literary labors pursued by, and often shared between, brother and
                sister. Within the pages of DCMS 20, Dorothy regularly mentions the time she spends
                reading (sometimes out of doors), writing letters, writing new verse from dictation
                or copying poetry (such as on 17 December, when she is “Writing all the morning for
                William”), and of course composing the journal entries themselves. At times, we see
                such activities overlapping, as when Dorothy copies unpublished stanzas drafted for
                <title level="a">Complaint of the Forsaken Indian Woman,</title> a poem first published in 
                <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> (1798), at the end of the notebook. The
                journal documents a shared life and shared work.
            </p>
                  <p>A careful reading of DCMS 20 also enables us to piece together how Dorothy’s journal
                entries might have been shared with her brother and how William often took
                inspiration and even phrases from Dorothy’s journals for use in his poems. On 10
                June 1800, just a few days after William’s return home on the 7th, Dorothy includes
                a long narrative recollecting her encounter with a tall beggar woman and her family
                from more than two weeks prior. In this case, Dorothy reaches back to record a past
                event, possibly because after William returned home and Dorothy had told him about
                it, he asked her to describe it in her journal, their common memory device. In a
                journal entry from 13 March 1802, we find a precise description of how William
                returned to this 1800 entry nearly two years later:
                
                <quote>William finished <title level="m">Alice Fell</title>, &amp; then he wrote the poem of
                the Beggar woman, taken from a Woman whom I had seen in May–(now nearly 2 years ago)
                when John &amp; he were at Gallow Hill – – I sate with him at Intervals all the
                morning, took down his stanzas, &amp;c – . . . . After tea I read to William that
                account of the little Boys belonging to the tall woman &amp; an unlucky thing it was
                for he could not escape from those very words, &amp; so he could not write the poem,
                he left it unfinished &amp; went tired to Bed.

                     </quote>
            
                Also within DCMS 20 we find Dorothy’s lengthy description of a leech gatherer (in an
                entry for 3 October 1800), which was later used to shape <title level="a">Resolution and
                Independence,</title> drafted between 4 May and 4 July 1802. Perhaps one of the reasons for
                the careful preservation of this (and other notebooks) is that these uses of the
                journal entries could be delayed by many years. In some cases, however, the uptake
                was more immediate: on 11 October 1800, Dorothy describes walking to an abandoned
                sheepfold in Greenhead Ghyll (the mountain stream that runs to the northeast of the
                Swan in fig. 2.3), capturing thoughts and images central to William’s poem
                <title level="a">Michael,</title> which is already being drafted at the time.
            </p>
                  <p>Dorothy’s entry of 13 March 1802, discussing William’s vexed attempt to write a poem
                about the tall beggar woman, suggests that William could feel stimulated but also
                trapped by Dorothy’s words. It is not known whether the “very words” she uses
                confine him because he feels obligated not to use them or because—as seems more
                likely—they dominate his mind, seem impossible to surpass, or do not fit the meter
                or mode of poetic composition he is attempting. Dorothy seems sympathetic to the
                writer’s block she has induced (“unlucky thing it was”), though perhaps she takes
                some pleasure in knowing her words have impact.
            </p>
                  <p>The journal’s descriptions of collaboration, whether smooth or frustrated, raise
                ethical questions about William’s use of Dorothy’s writing. Such questions have long
                been a source of interest and concern to feminist scholars who, since the 1980s,
                have raised claims that William appropriated Dorothy’s work and stifled her
                creativity, preventing her from becoming “more than half a poet.”
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">In an oft-cited journal entry for 18 March 1802,
                            DW describes how viewing Rydal Lake at moonlight “made [her] more than
                            half a poet” (<title level="m">GJ</title>, 81).
                </note> 
                As Patricia Comitini has noted, most “scholarship has focused
                primarily on [Dorothy’s] failure to realize herself, develop her talent, or
                establish her own home,” and William’s uncredited use of her writing is often blamed
                for this.

                Ultimately, however, Dorothy’s fate was tied to that of
                her brother, and his ability to produce marketable poems was indispensable to the
                family economy. Lucy Newlyn has written eloquently about the siblings’ relationship,
                understanding that their literary, affective, and economic lives were inevitably
                intertwined.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">See <title level="m">Newlyn</title>.</note> 
                It should also be remembered that Dorothy’s economic
                dependency, as a single woman without property, meant that, practically speaking,
                she <emph>was</emph> unable to assert intellectual
                property in her “very words.”

                </head>
                  <p>It is unknown the extent to which Dorothy’s journal notebooks may have been read by
                others besides William during the period in which they were being written and
                subsequently during the remaining 55 years that she lived. We do know that William’s
                nephew, Christopher Wordsworth, learned of their existence and, in his 1851 
                <title level="m">Memoirs of William Wordsworth</title>, included over 50 pages from
                the four Grasmere journal notebooks and Dorothy’s unpublished <title level="m">
                Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland</title>. According to Mary Ellen
                Bellanca, the “avowed purpose for excerpting her texts [was] to furnish contexts for
                the poems,”
                <note place="foot" resp="editors"> Bellanca, <title level="a">After-Life-Writing,</title> 
                    204.
                </note> 
                and Christopher directly stated
                that the “materials” like Dorothy’s journals and letters were to be considered
                “subordinate and ministerial to the Poems, and illustrative of them.”

                        <title level="m">Memoirs</title>, 1:3.</note> 
                Nevertheless, as Bellanca
                explains, many of Christopher’s selections “bear little relation to the poetry or
                even significant incidents” but were included for their intrinsic merit, and in
                particular as a means of presenting Dorothy “in effect, as a nature writer.”

                Here we find a blueprint for the reception of Dorothy’s writing that to a large
                extent continues today, in which the <title level="m">Grasmere Journals</title> are
                understood to be central to her reputation, their value conceived as depending on
                their descriptions of natural scenery and the context they provide for her brother’s
                life and poems.
            </p>
                  <p>Dorothy’s Grasmere-period journals were first presented to the public in a more
                complete form than the 1851 <title level="m">Memoirs</title> allowed in William
                Knight’s
                <title level="m">Journals of Dorothy Wordsworth</title> of 1897.
                In his introduction, he notes, albeit with some concern, that “many sentences in the
                Journal present a curious resemblance to words and phrases which occur in the
                    poems.”

                His edition
                offers special praise for these journals (“To many readers this will be by far
                the most interesting section of all Dorothy Wordsworth’s writings”) and describes
                their importance in terms nearly identical to those articulated by Christopher
                Wordsworth:
            
                <quote>[The journals] not only contains exquisite descriptions of Grasmere and its district—a
                most felicitous record of the changes of the seasons and the progress of the year,
                details as flower and tree, bird and beast, mountain and lake—but it casts a flood
                of light on the circumstances under which her brother’s poems were composed.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">
                           <title level="m">KJ</title>, ix–x.</note>
                     </quote>
                
                Knight enhances this “flood of light” by including footnotes referencing passages in
                the journal that are echoed in William’s poems, a practice that was continued by her
                next editor, Ernest de Sélincourt, in 1941.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <title level="m">DWJ</title>, 1:37–189.</note>
                Fortunately, De Selincourt restored many of the passages Knight saw fit to censor in
                his edition: chiefly, Knight cut Dorothy’s descriptions of laborious housework,
                bodily functions, and physical illnesses, as well as her commentary about some
                members of the community (such as drunken priests and battered wives), which he
                presumably thought were indelicate to bring before his Victorian readers.
            </p>
                  <p>The <title level="m">Grasmere Journals</title> were first initiated into the canon of
                Romantic literature for the reasons identified by Christopher Wordsworth and William
                Knight. Brief selections from the journals were the first writing by a woman of the
                Romantic period to be included in the <title level="m">Norton Anthology of English
                Literature</title> (in the third edition of 1974), chiefly because they could be used
                to illuminate William’s poetry.

                </note>
                Notwithstanding significant shifts in how Dorothy’s writing
                is understood today, nearly 50 years after her first appearance in the <title level="m">Norton</title>, 
                student anthologies continue to emphasize entries that speak to her brother’s poetry,
                illuminate their shared domestic and emotional life, or (in keeping with the vision of
                Romanticism as inspired nature writing) foreground Dorothy’s perspicacious observations
                on her surroundings. For example, the 2000 (7th) edition of the <title level="m">Norton
                Anthology of English Literature</title> includes only four entries from this first notebook,
                all of which directly relate to William and his poetry:

                  <p>The second edition of the <title level="m">Broadview Anthology of Literature</title>
                (2006) includes the same first three entries (14 May, 3 and 11 October 1800), and
                many similar examples might be cited. These anthologizing practices arguably distort
                the content of the journals, selected because they illuminate William’s creative
                processes and surroundings. One of our chief aims in representing this first
                notebook in its entirety (as opposed to making selections from all four Grasmere
                journal notebooks) has been to focus attention on the richness and diversity of
                Dorothy’s writing about her life in Grasmere and also to provoke us to understand
                that while her brother and his poetry were important elements of her life, they were
                not centrally or exclusively what the journal was about.
            </p>
                  <p>Additionally, many print sources ignore the materiality of the originals and the
                obvious facts that the entries were handwritten, seemingly quickly, in very small
                notebooks, often many days after the scenes and events described. Selections such as
                we find in modern anthologies often provide a false impression of the journal
                entries as carefully wrought vignettes, products of a reflective, sedate life. This
                edition counters these impressions by reproducing, as precisely as possibly,
                Dorothy’s words in a diplomatic transcription. In addition, facsimiles of several
                notebook pages have been provided to help the reader to understand the appearance
                and dimensions of the notebook, the entry system Dorothy used, and the handwriting
                within it. By these means, we can trace how Dorothy missed or misdated days, made
                strikethroughs and emendations, and generally wrote in haste, in moments snatched at
                the end of what appear to have been very full and tiring days. We can observe
                Dorothy including references to individuals and places without providing explanation
                or context, as it was unnecessary for her to do so given her imagined (and actual)
                audience of her brother. The next section provides more detail about the material
                nature of the notebook and our edition of it.

                  <p>Unlike the writings by Dorothy included in most other sections of this edition, no
                one, including Dorothy, recopied the first Grasmere journal notebook. It exists in a
                single manuscript, DCMS 20. As we have seen, Dorothy was prompted to begin the
                journal because of the departure of her brothers on a trip to Yorkshire.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">Journaling itself was not new to DW. Her
                       first known diary, kept between 20 January and 22 May 1798, is now
                       called the Alfoxden Journal (named after the home where she and WW lived
                       in Somerset). This manuscript was edited, perhaps heavily, by
                       William Knight, who published it along with the Grasmere-period
                       journals in 1897. Unfortunately, the manuscript has not survived; it
                       may have been lost or destroyed by Knight himself. DW also kept a
                       journal during the early part of her visit, with WW, to Hamburg and
                       Goslar, Germany, from 14 September to 1 October 1798. This journal
                       was also included by Knight.

                <title level="m">Grasmere Journals</title>, though there is a gap between the first notebook and
                the second. The last entry in DCMS 20 is dated 22 December 1800, and it ends
                midsentence. In another notebook, now missing, Dorothy likely continued this
                sentence; and she continued that journal in the next surviving Grasmere notebook
                (DCMS 25), which begins at 10 October 1801, more than nine months after DCMS 20
                abruptly ends. Dorothy would continue to write journals, across multiple notebooks,
                for most of her life. We include selections from the <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-overview.html">
                Rydal notebooks</ref> in this edition.
            </p>
                  <p>As mentioned previously, DCMS 20 is small, measuring just 15 x 9.5 cm, with mottled
                brown paper covers. It was not unused when Dorothy came to it in May 1800. Remaining
                stubs of cut-out pages have discernible writing on them, as do the endpapers. As
                Pamela Woof explains, the stray figures, accounts (see fig. 2.1), lists, and German
                words indicate that the notebook had been used during the Wordsworths’ visit to
                Germany in 1798–1799.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">

                The notebook as we have it now begins in one direction with the first journal entry; however,
                before that, it had apparently been used the other way round. From the other end,
                following the five cut-out pages, Dorothy copied down four epitaphs from her visit
                to Durham in the early summer of 1799.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <title level="m">GJ</title>, 159–60.</note>
                The epigraphs are followed by five unpublished stanzas of William’s “Complaint of the Forsaken
                Indian Woman,” a poem first published in <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>
                (1798). These verses end halfway down a page, with the final journal entries for
                December 1800 meeting them but being written with the book rotated 180 degrees (see
                fig. 2.5). Transcriptions of the epitaphs and William’s poem are included in our
                edition to demonstrate the heterogeneous nature of the notebook’s contents. They
                also remind us of the thrift involved in writing within the Wordsworths’ household;
                as a partially used notebook, with many pages remaining, it was available for reuse.
                Paper was an expensive commodity during the period, and making the most of a small
                notebook was another way to practice economy. As a notebook, moreover, DCMS 20 could
                be easily transported: we know Dorothy had it in Germany, and it is also possible
                she brought the notebook with her when she went to visit the Coleridges in Keswick,
                though if she did, she used it sparingly.

                  <p>Dorothy left no room, in the top or bottom or side margins, or between the lines, for
                additions, once again demonstrating thrift in using all available space (see fig.
                2.5) and suggesting no intention to revise the journal entries. She did on occasion
                cancel a word or two, and in those cases where a deleted word (or two or three)
                cannot be made out, it is noted (as “[illegible deleted word]”) in the
                transcription. Many of the changes were made in the first instance of writing, as a
                word was crossed out and immediately replaced in the same line. Dorothy does appear
                to have returned to the manuscript after the entries had been made, however, and
                made some changes, particularly to correct dates, which she had frequently
                mistaken.

                  <p>The handwriting throughout the notebook is legible but variable in size and far from
                tidy. It is quite different from the careful, even hand we see on display in her
                fair copies (such as the hand that appears in her <title level="m">Journal of a
                Tour of the Continent</title>, DCMS 90—fig. 2.7) but more like the writing of her
                informal letters. Her punctuation is erratic. Indeed, often there is no punctuation
                at all, and when there is, her dashes, periods, and commas are often
                indistinguishable. We have not edited her writing to include additional punctuation,
                and we have tried to reproduce her marks as they appear, though doing so often
                presents a challenge (as in marks appearing in unexpected or indeterminate places or
                the many canceled words that are impossible to decipher). In addition to her
                handwriting and mistakes in dating, the lack of punctuation reinforces the
                conclusion that Dorothy usually wrote quickly. In keeping with the journal form, she
                dates her entries (though again, often erroneously and irregularly) and uses ruled
                lines to signify breaks between them. Discernible changes in the ink and handwriting
                between the entries are rare.

                set off into York=<lb/>
            =shire after dinner at ½ past<lb/>
            2 o’clock – cold pork in their<lb/>
            pockets. I left them at the<lb/>
            turning of the Low-wood bay<lb/>
            under the trees. My heart<lb/>
            was so full that I could<lb/>
            hardly speak to W when<lb/>
            I gave him a farewell kiss.<lb/>

            -ly, the weltering on the<lb/>
            shores seemed a heavy<lb/>
            sound. I walked as long<lb/>
            as I could amongst the stones<lb/>
            of the shore. The wood<lb/>
            rich in flowers. A beau-<lb/>
            -tiful yellow, palish yellow<lb/>
            flower, that looked thick<lb/>
            round &amp; double, &amp; smelt<lb/>
            very sweet – I supposed<lb/>
            it was a ranunculus –<lb/>

            Met a blind man driving<lb/>
            a very large beautiful<lb/>
            Bull &amp; a cow – he walked<lb/>
            with two sticks. Came home<lb/>
            by Clappersgate. The valley<lb/>
            very green – many sweet views<lb/>
            up to Rydale head when<lb/>
            I could juggle away the<lb/>
            fine houses – but they<lb/>
            disturbed me even more<lb/>
            than when I have been<lb/>
            happier – one beautiful<lb/>
            view of the Bridge, without<lb/>

               </p>
               <p>Sate down very often – tho’<lb/>
            it was cold – I resolved to<lb/>

            again. At Rydale a woman<lb/>
            of the village, stout &amp; well<lb/>
            =dressed, begged a halfpenny<lb/>
            she had never she said done<lb/>
            it before – but these “hard<lb/>
            times!” – Arrived at home<lb/>
            with a bad head-ach – set<lb/>
            some slips of privett. The<lb/>
            evening cold – had a fire –<lb/>
            my face now flame-coloured <pb/>

               <p>It is nine o’clock, I shall soon<lb/>
            go to bed. A young woman<lb/>
            begged at the door – she had come<lb/>
            from Manchester on Sunday morn<lb/>
            with two shillings &amp; a slip of paper<lb/>
            which she supposed a Bank<lb/>

            had buried her husband &amp; three<lb/>
            children within a year &amp; a<lb/>
            half – All in one grave burying<lb/>
            very dear – paupers all put<lb/>
            in one place – 20 shillings<lb/>
            paid for as much ground as<lb/>

            sensibly &amp; cheerfully about<lb/>

            There were no near kind<lb/>

            &amp; the prospect looked so<lb/>

                    They became close friends and regular correspondents. The Clarksons lived from 
                    1794 to 1803 in the Lakes, at Eusemere, on Ullswater. Thomas Clarkson was a

                  <p>On 6 November 1805, just as mild weather gave way to autumn rain, Dorothy and William
                Wordsworth set out to see their friends Charles and Letitia Luff in Patterdale, 12
                miles northeast of Grasmere on the southern tip of Ullswater.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Composing in the form of a journal, DW divides her account into days. However, as often happens in her 
                    journals, she mistakes the dates. As noted, she and WW left Grasmere on Wednesday, 6 November (not on 7 November, as stated in her manuscripts) 
                    and returned on the night of Tuesday, 12 November. Therefore, when DW mentions a date, readers should simply subtract one, though she is accurate 
                    in identifying the days of the week.
                    </note>
                They planned for only a short visit but ended up spending a week exploring what
                Dorothy called the “wonderful country” around England’s second-largest lake.

                Her account of this tour, <title level="a">Excursion on the Banks of Ullswater</title> (hereafter <title level="a">Ullswater Excursion</title>), 
                    presents her observations and experiences in genial prose. Since many of the landmarks she mentions remain today, much of what she saw appears 
                    in our <ref target="https://tinyurl.com/bdfunzhh">

                  <p>Dorothy’s Ullswater tour was essentially a counterclockwise circuit of the lake
                punctuated by side excursions. Afterward, she summarized her itinerary for her
                friend Catherine Clarkson: “William and I spent three days at Luff’s and three at
                Park house.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Park House was Thomas Hutchinson’s home near the northern end of Ullswater (1804–1808). His 
                    sisters Sara and Joanna kept house for him.
                    </note>
                We went the Wednesday after you left us—walked with Thomas Wilkinson through the
                Lowther woods—a marvelously beautiful walk. . . . We rode to Park House under
                Stybarrow Crag, and the day before we were also in Martindale with the
                Luffs—crossing over the mountain back to Patterdale.”

                    </note>
                If we add that the siblings crossed the Kirkstone Pass (1,489 ft.—the Lake
                District’s highest road) to reach the Luffs’ and that six days later they marched
                down Ullswater’s long western shore and traversed Kirkstone again, we can imagine
                something like the trip’s full circle (see fig. 3.1).</p>

                     <title level="a">Ullswater Excursion</title> is among the projects Susan Levin has described as “narratives
                in which Dorothy Wordsworth represents herself as the woman who goes out to seek
                experience in the company of family and friends.”

                        <title level="m">LCE</title> xviii. Susan Levin’s “seek[ing] experience”
                                formula needs slight qualification in this case, given that DW was
                                not for the most part exploring new territory. She had been to
                                Ullswater many times, so the novelty of the trip had mainly to do
                                with circumstances. Still, she and WW wished to visit “some of the
                                vales tributary to Ullswater, where [they had] never been before”
                        <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.Ulls-letters.html">(<title level="m">Letters</title>, 1:637).</ref>

                It belongs to the Dove Cottage period, when Dorothy also produced her <title level="m">Grasmere Journals</title> (1800–1803) and 
                    <title level="m">Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland, A.D. 1803</title>. In fact, <title level="a">Ullswater Excursion</title> was composed 
                    at roughly the same time as <title level="m">Recollections</title>,
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <title level="m">Recollections</title> underwent multiple stages of composition, revision, and copying, 
                    but DW completed her first clean copy of the text on 31 May 1805, and the earliest surviving manuscript is a copy made at Patterdale by 
                    DW’s friend Catherine Clarkson on 1 November 1805, less than a week before the author’s Ullswater tour. For details, see 
                    <title level="m">DWJ</title>, 1.viii–xiv.
                </note> 
                and, though shorter, it belongs to the same genre, the reconstructed travel journal.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">DW emphasized that she did not compose <title level="m">Recollections</title> on the spot. By the Bye I am writing,” 
                    she wrote to Catherine Clarkson in late 1803, “not a Journal, for we took no notes, but <hi rend="italic">recollections</hi> of our Tour in the 
                    form of a Journal” (<title level="m">Letters</title> 1:421). In truth, DW did make a few hasty notes in Scotland, but she wished she had written 
                    more (see Carol Kyros Walker’s editorial introduction to <title level="m">Recollections</title>, 20).
                </note>
                As Ernest de Sélincourt explained, her Scottish journal was “written at leisure
                after her return, while the events recorded were still vivid in her memory, and when
                she could see the whole tour in something of artistic perspective”; the same seems
                to be true of the Ullswater text.

                    While Dorothy included some details from the trip in a <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.Ulls-letters.html">letter</ref> she wrote on the
                trip’s second day, she apparently waited until after her return to Grasmere to draft the full narrative.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">Unfortunately, the manuscripts do not indicate composition dates; each simply begins “November 1805.” However, 
                    given that DW was still describing details of the trip in letters to Catherine Clarkson and Lady Beaumont at the end of November 
                    (see <title level="m">Letters</title>, 1:646–47, 648–52), she likely had not yet completed her
                                complete account by then. Her late-November letters also indicate
                                that she had been ill and quite busy, probably without much leisure
                                to write. Possibly she finished drafting the narrative in December
                                1805 or January 1806.
                </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why she wrote this account, and for whom, is not altogether clear. As the <title level="m">Grasmere Journals</title> (1800–1803) 
                demonstrate, personal and shared memories routinely jostled
                together in her notebooks, and she often recorded experiences as potential sources
                for her own future writing or for William’s. In <title level="a">Ullswater Excursion,</title> she records
                joyful moments with her brother, yet she clearly has an external audience in mind.
                She remarks in her report on day 2, “To attempt to <hi rend="italic">describe</hi>
                the place would be absurd when you for whom I write have been there, or may go
                thither as soon as you like.” Thus, her first intended reader (or readers) must have
                lived in or near the Lake District or had the means to visit easily. She might have
                said, as she later did concerning her Scottish tour, “I wrote my journal, or rather
                <hi rend="italic">recollections</hi> for the sake of my Friends who it seemed
                ought to have been with us, but were confined at home by other duties.”

                        <title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:2.</note>
                At this point, seemingly, she had no thoughts of print publication.

                  <p>In 1941, De Sélincourt speculated that Dorothy wrote <title level="a">Ullswater Excursion</title> for Lady
                Margaret Beaumont, citing William’s 1823 explanation that it “was written for one
                acquainted with the general features of the country.”

                In light of the letters Dorothy sent to Lady Beaumont during and just after the
                Ullswater tour, she was likely the one of whom William spoke <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.Ulls-letters.html">(see section appendix)
                </ref>. Although the two women had yet to meet in person, they had been carrying on a warm correspondence.
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors">See, for instance, DW’s affectionate letter of 27 October: “I am sure I seem to know you very well. 
                        I have the same kind of pleasure in thinking of you as if I had really seen you, I am reminded of you by things daily before our eyes, 
                        just as if you had been often with us, had frequented the same paths and were familiar with the retired places of our valley” 
                        (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 1:630–31).
                        </note>
                Perhaps Lady Beaumont, enthused by Dorothy’s letters, had
                asked for a longer, more circumstantial account of her adventure. She and her
                husband, Sir George, were generous patrons as well as friends to the Wordsworths, so
                Dorothy was understandably eager to please them. <title level="a">Ullswater Excursion</title> might, then,
                be read as a reciprocal gift offered in a spirit of gratitude.
                </p>
                  <p>As detailed more fully in Section II, two manuscript versions of <title level="a">Ullswater
                Excursion</title> survive. The first, preserved in one of Dorothy’s notebooks, is slightly
                longer and somewhat messier, while the second—a fair copy likely prepared for Lady
                Beaumont—removes some details while offering clarifications and stylistic
                adjustments. Regrettably, we know little about the manuscripts’ use or possible
                circulation. Our primary clues about their reception are the simple facts already
                related: one copy was carefully preserved by the Beaumonts, and the other, retained
                by Dorothy herself, remained significant in Wordsworth family memory. William
                thought highly enough of it to make it part of his Lakeland guidebook, and, years
                later, nephew Christopher mentioned it in his 1851 <title level="m">Memoirs of
                William Wordsworth</title>, acknowledging the authorship of his aunt.

                        <title level="m">Memoirs</title>, 1:319. Christopher’s revelation that 
                            <title level="a">Ullswater Excursion</title> was “from Miss Wordsworth’s pen” made no 
                            significant ripple in the reception record, but at least he was able to recognize DW’s work four years
                            before her death. At that point, the <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> version of her narrative, 
                            generally thought to be WW’s, had been in print for 28 years.

                  <p>Dorothy composed <title level="a">Ullswater Excursion</title> at a time distinguished by creative
                accomplishment but also by personal and family worries. She left a good deal unsaid.
                For instance, when she reports that “Derwent ran to meet us,” informed readers
                should picture a five-year-old who has not seen his father for almost two years,
                eager to embrace some of the most important adults in his life. The missing father,
                Samuel Taylor Coleridge, appears by name at only one point, yet his perplexing
                absence hangs in the air. Then, to acknowledge another powerful absence, when
                Dorothy describes coming in view of “the mountains above Grisedale,” ostensibly
                making the plainest sort of topographical reference, she unavoidably has in mind her
                beloved brother John—Captain John Wordsworth, who died in a shipwreck in February.
                It was near Grisedale Tarn that she and William parted with him after his last visit
                to Grasmere, bidding farewell as he rushed down the Ullswater side of the mountains,
                full of hope about his coming voyage on the <hi rend="italic">Earl of
                Abergavenny</hi>. It was there, too, that William had found a vent for his
                feelings in early June, composing an elegy through tears.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">See WW’s “I only look’d for pain and grief” (<title level="m">Major Works</title>,08–11),

                    </note>
                As Dorothy exclaimed in her 9 June letter to Lady Beaumont, “Oh! My dear Friend, you
                will not wonder that we love that place.”

                Similarly, when in <title level="a">Ullswater Excursion</title> she recounts the tale of two local brothers
                drowning (thus explaining the name of “Brothers Water”), it seems unimaginable that
                she isn’t also reflecting on the recent drowning of her own brother. And might she
                not also think of him when she describes learning about the death of Admiral Nelson
                at Trafalgar?
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">In her 29 November letter to Lady Beaumont, DW recalls that the sudden news of Nelson’s 
                    death caused her to burst into tears. Just before this, she reports that “the Image of our departed Brother haunts me with many a pang” 
                    and confesses her worry that STC may face dangers at sea <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.Ulls-letters.html">(<title level="m">Letters</title>, 1:648–45)</ref>.

                  <p>Indeed, with all of these interweaving stories in mind, Dorothy’s <title level="a">Ullswater
                Excursion,</title> for all its frankness, actually seems reticent. Most of its emotional
                iceberg remains underwater. Then again, Dorothy apparently had no need to explain
                such personal contexts to her first readers. Perhaps an implicit understanding of
                circumstances was part of what she had in mind when she wrote to Lady Beaumont on 29
                November, “To make [our daily goings-on and my own peculiar feelings] interesting
                love must be in your heart.”

                  <p>Because Dorothy’s original readers (in manuscript) must have been relatively few, the
                reception of the Ullswater text becomes easier to follow once it finds its way into
                print. Both of Dorothy’s “excursions”—<ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.SP-intro.html">

                and <title level="a">Excursion on the Banks of Ullswater</title>
                (1805)—have been widely admired since they first appeared, respectively, in the
                third (1822) and fourth (1823) editions of William’s <title level="m">Guide to the
                Lakes</title>. Though written some 13 years apart, these texts were forever linked
                by being placed alongside each other (and similarly transformed) in all editions or
                reprintings of the <title level="m">Guide</title> from 1823
                forward (see fig. 3.2).

                At the 1883 gathering of the Wordsworth Society, Stopford Brooke attempted to
                support his argument about William’s propensity for “falling into the modes of
                poetry [even] in the midst of his prose” by quoting several remarkable passages from
                the <title level="m">Guide</title> actually written by Dorothy.

                  <p>On one level, the Wordsworth siblings’ journey to Ullswater was a house-hunting trip.
                Fond as they were of Dove Cottage, it was becoming too small for the growing family
                and its regular house guests, especially in the wintertime, when everyone spent more
                time indoors. In November 1805, William and Mary had two children under the age of
                three and were expecting their third.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">John was born on 18 June 1803 and Dora on 16 August 1804. Thomas would be born on 15 June 1806.</note>
                Moreover, they longed to become homeowners, as evidenced in numerous letters from
                this period contemplating possible locations and building projects. An early
                highlight of the trip to Ullswater, then, was inspecting Broad How, an attractive
                lot for sale near the Luffs’ home in Patterdale. Almost immediately, as Dorothy’s
                account chronicles, they began imagining a dream home there, and to that end William
                visited their friend Thomas Wilkinson to ask for help negotiating the purchase of
                this property.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Some details about discovering the potential house site appear in one manuscript (DCMS 51) 
                    but not in the other (Coleorton). DW writes in the more detailed account, “Our fancies could not resist the temptation &amp; 
                    we fixed upon a spot for a cottage which we began to build &amp; finished as easily as castles are raised in the air.”
                    </note>
                Ultimately, with the help of Lord Lowther, William did purchase it in 1806. He held
                on to this plot for nearly 30 years but never did remodel the old home that stood
                there or build a new one.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">On the acquisition of Broad How, see Gill, 253; Knight, <title level="m">Life of William
                    Wordsworth</title>, 2:37–38; <title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:67–9, 75–77; Sands, <title level="m">Portrait
                    of the Wordsworth Country</title>, 180–81. As DW reports, WW first visited Wilkinson on the evening of Saturday, 9 November,
                    after leaving DW at Park House. Then WW and DW (along with SH and one of the Misses Green) returned to Wilkinson’s house on
                    Monday, 11 November on their way to visit Lowther Woods, taking Wilkinson as their guide. WW walked Wilkinson home that evening
                    while DW and the others waited at Red Hill. No doubt the men talked business. WW and DW returned to Grasmere on the following day,
                    apparently confident that their property negotiations would be in good hands. In the end, the deal did not transpire exactly as 
                    WW wished, but he reluctantly accepted the terms. Lord Lowther put up #1,000, though WW had said the land was worth no more 
                    than #800.
                    </note>
                To alleviate the crowding problem in Grasmere, the Wordsworths spent the winter of 1806–1807
                at Coleorton as guests of the Beaumonts, and in 1808 they moved from Dove Cottage to Allan Bank.
                </p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="a">Ullswater Excursion</title> also records the Wordsworths taking strength
                from their extended network of friends and family, including the Hutchinsons at Park House and
                Captain John Wordsworth at Brougham Hall. (Captain Wordsworth was the kinsman who
                mentored their late brother in his sailor’s trade.) Yet, while never concealing that
                their trip was as much about domestic affairs and business as pleasure, Dorothy used
                the material at hand to create a first-rate piece of travel writing. She was fond of
                Ullswater because, as she told Lady Beaumont, it had not yet been spoiled by “fancy
                builders” and was “full of visions of things . . . that might have employed our
                fancy happily for hours, if they had not in the next moment been replaced by others
                as beautiful.”

                And, like many of the age’s best travel narratives, Dorothy’s recounts experiencing
                a distinctive region chiefly on foot. Nature walks were of course among the
                Wordsworth siblings’ favorite pastimes, and, true to form, Dorothy managed to cover
                some 75 miles in six days, with only occasional breaks riding her pony (a recent
                gift from her oldest brother, Richard) or cruising in the Luffs’ rowboat. As Dorothy
                would afterward quip, her stamina left both herself and her brother “boast[ing] of
                [her] wonderful strength.”

                  </p>
                  <p>If anything, Dorothy’s delight in the journey increased as it became more ambitious.
                Though confessedly reluctant to embark from Grasmere on a “damp and gloomy morning,”
                she reported that “as the mists thickened” over Kirkstone Pass, “[their] enjoyments
                increased.” On subsequent days—usually with William and sometimes also with their
                friends—she explored the lake’s southeastern shore, hiked over the mountains from
                Martindale to Patterdale, wandered through the Lowther Woods and the familiar
                streets of Penrith, and twice trekked the full length of Ullswater. On the final day
                alone, she and William walked or rode approximately 23 miles, all after 3:00 p.m.
                After coming back across Kirkstone by starlight, she and William arrived at Dove
                Cottage long after Mary and the children had gone to bed.
                </p>
                  <p>For Dorothy, this had been a genuine holiday, one reminiscent of tramps undertaken in
                earlier years, when she and her brother spent much of their lives walking, talking,
                and planning the future together. It must also have sparked memories of previous
                Ullswater visits, including their famed encounter with the daffodils beside the lake
                in 1802, when William was settling his affairs with Annette Vallon and preparing to
                wed Mary Hutchinson. Grounded, then, in feelings both present and past, <title level="a">Ullswater
                Excursion</title> offers some of Dorothy’s most luminous writing. Over two centuries later,
                it still lingers in the ear and on the mind’s eye: “At such a time and in such a
                place every scattered stone the size of one’s head becomes a companion”; “Place-Fell
                steady and bold as a lion; the whole lake driving onward like a great river”; “We
                observed the lemon-coloured leaves of the birches . . . as the wind turned them to
                the sun, sparkle, or rather flash, like diamonds”; “The stars in succession took
                their stations on the mountain-tops”; “All the cheerfulness of the scene was in the
                sky.” These passages and others like them await the reader of “Excursion on the
                Banks of Ullswater,” which this edition presents with thorough annotations and
                illustrations.

                  <p>As noted previously, <title level="a">Excursion on the Banks of Ullswater</title> survives in two
                manuscripts. The first, Dove Cottage Manuscript 51 (DCMS 51) is a hand-sewn notebook containing 
                both prose and verse (fig. 3.3). This notebook preserves various materials related to the Ullswater
                text, including five pages of draft fragments (pp. 1–5) plus two experimental introductions
                (pp. 18–20) that helped produce the 1823 <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title>. Its 
                complete copy of the Ullswater narrative (pp. 21–34) is the earliest known. Like 
                <title level="a">Excursion up Scawfell Pike,</title> it shows multiple sets of revisions, some 
                in pen and some (later) in pencil. The base layer is in Dorothy’s hand, while edits appear
                in her handwriting but possibly also in William’s. We ignore the penciled edits in
                our apparatus, seeking so far as possible to emphasize Dorothy’s own work rather
                than trace the evolution of William’s <title level="m">Guide</title>. Still, all of
                the edits, along with the separate fragments and draft introductions, are arguably
                important for the reception history of Dorothy’s writing, and readers can see the
                results of the multistage revision process in our transcription of the 1823

                  <p>The second manuscript—the basis for our annotated text—played no direct part in
                the evolution of Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title>. Now held by the Morgan
                Library and Museum in New York, this 16-page document (MA 1581) appears in Dorothy’s
                neatest hand (fig. 3.4).

                Editors Owen and Smyser named it the “Coleorton Manuscript,” noting that it appeared among the Morgan

                     <note place="foot" resp="editors">The manuscript remained with the Beaumont family until at least 1882–1883, when Sir George, the 10th baronet,
                    loaned it to William Knight, and probably into the early decades of the twentieth century. When and how it left the family is uncertain, but eventually
                    it came into the possession of <ref target="https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-31085">Benjamin

                and supposing (with De Sélincourt) that it was made for Lady Beaumont, who for much
                of her life resided at Coleorton Hall in Leicestershire. Added support for their
                surmise comes from the manuscript itself, which features, at the top of its first
                page, a descriptive note in another hand: “a mountainous ramble by D Wordsworth
                sister to <hi rend="underline">the poet</hi>.” While it is difficult to draw certain
                conclusions based on a 10-word sample, this appears to be the handwriting of Lady
                Beaumont.

                  <p>In this attractive document, Dorothy edits the DCMS 51 text or a closely related
                draft for style and accuracy. Notably, she removes her account (from 11 November,
                day 6) of walking in Penrith at night, seeing old acquaintances, and revisiting
                familiar haunts. Perhaps she considered this tour of sites linked to her adolescence
                too private or just uninteresting for her likely readers.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Newlyn suggests this passage was “a keepsake for her sister-in-law [MW], to commemorate their shared past”
                     (215). The two became close when, as an orphaned teenager, DW lived in Penrith with her stern maternal grandparents. At that time, the girls (along 
                     with Mary’s sister Peggy) would sneak out to walk in the country or visit one another’s houses (<title level="m">DWB</title>, 17–18).
                    </note>
                In any case, the Coleorton Manuscript probably best reflects her intentions for a
                manuscript text to be read outside of the immediate family circle.

                  <p>In William’s <title level="m">Guide</title>, <title level="a">Ullswater 
                Excursion</title> gains acceptability for a general audience but loses some of 
                its personality. As De Sélincourt succinctly puts it, “Dorothy wrote a 
                journal of this tour which her brother afterwards recast and appended to his
                <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title>: few readers will prefer his more
                formal, ‘literary’ version to Dorothy’s.”

                        <title level="m">DWB</title>, 196.</note> 
                To be fair, the <title level="m">Guide</title> version is also memorable, adapted
                for its purpose and embellished with a few novel passages. Nonetheless, Dorothy’s
                original is warmer, more detailed, and generally more engaging. This is true not
                only because of what De Sélincourt calls her “vivid beauty of feeling and 
                expression”
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <title level="m">DWB</title>, 196.</note>
                    —most of her best descriptive passages do appear in the <title level="m">Guide</title>, even if slightly altered—but also 
                    because of the intimacy of her report, which lends it human interest that might actually be out of place in a guidebook.
                </p>
                  <p>As in the case of <title level="a">Excursion Up Scawfell Pike,</title> the first
                thing one notices in comparing Dorothy’s manuscript text to the <title level="m">Guide</title>’s adaptation is that the latter is shorter and less
                personal. All of the individuals are missing: no “dear Coleridge,” no
                Luffs, no Hutchinsons, no Thomas Wilkinson. Even the pony is gone, and that seems 
                a shame; the poor beast is an important character, if only for what he reveals about
                Dorothy, whose sympathy toward animals, both wild and domesticated, comes through 
                strongly in the manuscripts.
                </p>
                  <p>Overall, then, the social nature of this tour becomes obscured in William’s retelling.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors"> Comparing the two versions in this manner, we make WW accountable for the changes. 
                    However, manuscript evidence somewhat complicates this simple division of responsibility. DCMS 51 shows late-stage edits in 
                    DW’s hand as well as WW’s. Given that DW and WW worked on revisions for the 
                    <title level="m">Guide</title> together (though certain new passages are unambiguously his), we should consider the possibility 
                    that edits for publication sometimes represented DW’s intention.
                </note>
                To be sure, William often adopts the first-person plural, as in “We left Grasmere
                vale,” “We noticed, as we passed,” and “The mists gathered as we
                went along”—his narrator does not wander lonely as a cloud. Nonetheless, his
                “we” remain basically anonymous. His formal “We were more than contented,
                ” describing the travelers’ wet crossing of the Kirkstone Pass, is far less 
                evocative than Dorothy’s report of brother and sister cheerfully advancing through 
                the mist, “as happy Travellers as ever paced side by side on a holiday ramble.”
                Lamentably, the changes made for the <title level="m">Guide</title>, necessary as they might
                be to preserve privacy, tend to obscure the core relationship that drives the text: the 
                partnership of the siblings, who must hold even more tightly to each other now that brother
                John is gone and the “set is . . . broken.”

                  </p>
                  <p>That close partnership helps explain a blunt fact that frequently troubles today’s readers:
                William published a substantial work by his sister without acknowledging the fact. Even devoted
                Victorian Wordsworthians could find this appropriation odd, as did Knight in his 1889 biography
                of the poet: “[Wordsworth] concluded [the <title level="m">Guide</title>] by incorporating
                the whole, or nearly the whole, of his sister’s journal, without any indication to the
                reader of who the real journalist was, or when his work ended, and that of his sister began!”
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Knight, <title level="m">Life of William Wordsworth</title>, 2:29. A few years later, Knight included WW’s 
                    <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> in volume 2 of his <title level="m">Prose Works</title> (1896) and duly inserted a footnote to the
                    Ullswater section: “It was written by his sister Dorothy.—E<hi rend="smallcaps">D</hi>.” (106). To his credit, having discovered 
                    the truth about the material’s authorship, Knight seemed eager to publicize it.
                    </note>
                We feel certain that William did so with her cooperation; “Wordsworth” was the family
                brand, and Dorothy regularly did what she could to support it, contributing to her own financial
                security as well as her brother’s reputation.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Several scholars have written persuasively on the Wordsworths’ shared investment in the family business. See,
                    for instance, Wallace, “Home at Grasmere Again,” and Heinzelman, “Cult of Domesticity.”
                    </note>
                The result was a substantially coauthored <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title>,
                even if it was not publicly acknowledged as such. With her intimate knowledge of the
                region, her capacity for wonder, and her gift for descriptive language, Dorothy
                contributed significantly to the <title level="m">Guide</title>’s success. As Mary
                Ellen Bellanca properly observes, “These considerations make plain that it is well
                past time to discard the notion of Dorothy Wordsworth as an unpublished, or only
                posthumously published, writer.”

                  <p>That said, to the extent that we base our edited text on manuscript evidence, the posthumously
                published Dorothy Wordsworth takes precedence in this edition. We offer <title level="a">Ullswater
                Excursion</title> complete with all of its personal, chatty, quotidian, and whimsical elements. 
                By doing so, we privilege Dorothy’s perspective on the Lake District, acknowledge the terms
                of her appeal to her first readers, and celebrate the qualities that make her travel writing unique.

                At that year’s gathering of the Society, William Knight announced that a copy of “a Mountain Ramble
                with the Poet, written by his Sister, in the year 1805” had come into his possession.

                     have been among these items.

                <title level="m">Transactions</title>, explaining that “a curious 
                <hi rend="italic">recast</hi> of this Journal-record of his
                sister was published by Wordsworth in an edition of his <title level="m">Guide to

                Knight’s was the first publication of the narrative under Dorothy’s name,
                approximately 78 years after its composition.
            </p>
                  <p>Knight mentioned the text again in his 1889 biography of William, noting the poet’s incorporation of this “Mountain Ramble” in the 
            <title level="m">Guide</title> and calling it “one of the most curious instances of
            the literary ‘communism’ between [the siblings].”
                <note place="foot">Knight, <title level="m">Life of William Wordsworth</title>, 2:29. Knight mistakenly claims the Ullswater 
                    text first appeared in the <title level="m">Guide</title>’s fifth edition (1835) rather than the fourth (1823)
                </note>
             Then, in 1897, he included his abridgment in his landmark edition of the <title level="m">Journals of Dorothy Wordsworth</title> 
             as <title level="a">Journal of a Mountain Ramble by Dorothy and William Wordsworth, November 7th to 13th, 1805.</title>

                acknowledging his abridgments with ellipses in all cases but two. He
                apparently preferred a brisk pace and pure description to what he
                might regard as digressive, personal chitchat.
                </note>
             Note that Knight’s consistent use of the word <hi rend="italic">ramble</hi> suggests
             that he had discovered the Coleorton Manuscript, which includes that label on its
             first page (see fig. 3.3).

                  <p>Knight’s edition remained the established text until 1941, when De Sélincourt included a new version in his own 
            <title level="m">Journals of Dorothy Wordsworth</title>.
                <note place="foot">
                        <title level="m">DWJ</title>, 1:413–22.</note>
            He explained, “Professor Knight printed an abbreviated version, [but it] is here given complete
            from Dorothy’s manuscript.”

            In fact, however, De Sélincourt sometimes followed Knight’s
            text, even while seeming unaware of the Coleorton Manuscript. It is possible that De
            Sélincourt worked from a third manuscript, now unknown,

            but it seems more likely that he drew on DCMS 51 with an
            eye toward Knight. Instead of retaining Knight’s title (“A Mountain Ramble”), he
            privileged that used in the <hi rend="italic">Guide to the Lakes</hi>, “Excursion on
            the Banks of Ullswater,” solidifying for twentieth-century readers the formal title

                  <p>In 1974, Jane Worthington Smyser and W. J. B. Owen undertook
                the most thorough textual analysis to date of <title level="a">Ullswater Excursion</title> in
                their <title level="m">Prose Works of William Wordsworth</title>
                volume 2, Appendix IV, pp. 368–78). They
                detailed all available manuscript material, including the fragments and false-start
                introductions of DCMS 51, endeavoring to illuminate the textual history of William’s
                <title level="m">Guide</title>. For tracing textual variants, their work remains
                indispensable. Unfortunately, <title level="m">Prose Works</title> is available only
                at high cost or in research libraries. Our electronic edition incorporates many of
                its findings while adding fresh research, providing manuscript facsimiles and other
                illustrations, and placing Dorothy Wordsworth in the foreground for a broad
                audience.

                  <p>As noted previously, this edition includes an <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.Ulls-reading.html">annotated and illustrated text</ref> 
                plus transcriptions of the <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.Ulls-A.html">two surviving manuscripts</ref> and the  
                <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.Ulls-C.html">1823 <title level="m">Guide</title> text</ref>, allowing readers to compare. The annotated 
                text is based on the Coleorton Manuscript, but we supply key omitted passages, known
                from DCMS 51, in the notes. We retain Dorothy’s idiosyncratic spelling and
                punctuation; therefore, readers should be aware that several place names differ from
                those found on modern maps (e.g., <title level="a">Boar Dale</title> for <title level="a">Boredale,</title>
                     <title level="a">Emont</title> for <title level="a">Eamont,</title>
                     <title level="a">Glenriddin</title> for <title level="a">Glenridding,</title>
                     <title level="a">Gowborough</title> for <title level="a">Gowbarrow,</title>
                     <title level="a">Sanwick</title> for
                <title level="a">Sandwick,</title> and <title level="a">Yanworth</title> for <title level="a">Yanwath</title>). For clarity, we expand abbreviated
                names—“W<hi rend="sup">m</hi>” to “William,” “Sara H.” to “Sara
                Hutchinson,” “T. Wilkinson” to “Thomas Wilkinson”—and regularize “Mr.” and “Mrs.” in
                US style, adding a period and using no superscripts.

               <p>William and Mary returned from Parkhouse by the Patterdale road along with Mr. and Mrs. Clarkson, having made a delightful excursion of 
                    three days.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Park House was the hilltop farm home of Thomas Hutchinson and (sometimes) Sara Hutchinson, siblings to WW’s 
                        wife, who had moved there from Gallow Hill, North Yorkshire, in May 1804. It was on the Dalemain Estate, about two miles north of Ullswater 
                        and three to the southwest of Penrith. [Illustration: Park House.] “Mr. and Mrs. Clarkson” were Thomas, the prominent abolitionist, and 
                        his wife, Catherine, who had lived at Eusemere near Pooley Bridge (not far from Park House) from 1796 to 1803. They had recently moved 
                        south for the sake of Catherine’s health, but they spent the summer of 1805 catching up with the Wordsworths at Grasmere, and in late 
                        October presumably wished to bid farewell to old friends and haunts before settling at Catherine’s hometown, Bury St Edmunds 
                        in Suffolk.

                    They had engaged that William and I should go to Mr. Luff’s on Wednesday or Thursday if the weather continued favorable.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Captain Charles Luff and his wife, Letitia, lived at Side Farm near Goldrill Bridge in Patterdale.

                    It was not very promising on Wednesday; but, having been fine for so long a time, we thought that there would not be an entire change all at 
                    once, therefore on a damp and gloomy morning we set forward, William on foot, and I upon the pony
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">The pony was a recent gift from DW’s brother Richard, who feared that DW would tire herself out with so 
                        much walking (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 1:631–32; <title level="m">DWB</title>, 195). Helpful as the pony was, it could 
                        sometimes be troublesome, as shown later in the excursion when it refuses to carry both her and WW across the River Eamont. One of DW’s 
                        letters to Richard, written a few days after the tour (15 November 1805), explains that the pony has an unfortunate tendency to 
                        stumble, prompting her to think she must replace it. This she regrets because she enjoys riding and finds that the pony’s paces “suit 
                        [her] exactly” (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 1:645–46).

                    (though we could not see fifty yards before us) we were as happy Travellers as ever paced side by side on a holiday ramble. At such a time and 
                    in such a place every scattered stone the size of one’s head becomes a companion: there is a fragment of an old wall at the top of 
                    Kirkstone, which, magnified yet obscured as it was by the mist, was scarcely less interesting to us when we cast our eyes upon it than the view 
                    of a noble monument of ancient grandeur has been – yet this same pile of stones we had never before observed. When we had 
                    descended considerably the fields of Hartsop below Brotherswater were first seen, like a Lake coloured by the reflection of yellow clouds, I 
                    <span change="blue">[Page 3]</span> mistook them for the water; but soon after we saw the Lake itself gleaming faintly with a grey steelly 
                    brightness; then appeared the brown oaks, and the birches of splendid colour, and, when we came still nearer to the valley, the cottages 
                    under their tufts of trees and the old Hall of Hartsop with its long irregular front and elegant chimneys.

                    We had eaten our dinner under the shelter of a Sheep-fold by the bridge at the foot of the mountain, having tethered the pony at the 
                    entrance, where it stood without one impatient beating of a foot. I could not but love it for its meekness, and indeed I thought we were selfish 
                    to enjoy our meal so heartily while his poor jaws were tethered by the curb bridle. We reached Mr. Luff’s about two hours before tea-time.

                    The general colour of the trees was dark brown, rather that of ripe hazel nuts; but towards <span rend="blue">[Page 5]</span> the water there were 
                    yet beds of green, and, in some of the hollow places in the highest part of the woods, the trees were of a yellow colour, and, through 
                    the glittering light, they looked like masses of clouds, as you see them gathered together in the West, and tinged with the golden light of 
                    the sun. After dinner we walked with Mrs. Luff up the Vale; I had never had an idea of the extent and width of it in passing thro’ along the 
                    road on the other side. We walked along the Path which leads from house to house; two or three times it took us through some of those copses 
                    or groves that cover every little hillock in the middle of the lower part of the Vale, making an intricate and beautiful intermixture of lawn 
                    and woodland. We left William to prolong his walk, and when he came into the house he told us that he had pitched upon the spot where he 
                    should like to build a house better than in any other he had ever yet seen.

                        The property under consideration was a 19-acre farm called Broad How. WW decided to 
                        purchase it, as later details in the narrative show. He owned the property until 1834 but never built a home there.

                    middle of the sky; but long before we could see her face, while all the eastern hills were in black shade, those on the opposite side were

                    for his accommodation at the yearly chace of red Deer in his Forests at the head of these Dales; the room is fitted up in the sportsman’s style, 
                    with a single cupboard for bottles and glasses &amp;c. some strong chairs, and a large dining table; and ornamented with the horns of the stags 
                    caught at these Hunts for many years back, with the length of the last race they ran recorded under each. We ate our dinner here; the good 
                    woman treated us with excellent butter and new oat bread, and, after drinking some of Mr. Hazel’s strong Ale we were well prepared to face the 
                    mountain, which we began to climb almost immediately. Martindale divides itself into two dales at the head. In one of these (that to the left) 
                    there is no house to be seen, nor any building but a cattle shed on the side of a hill which is sprinkled over with wood, evidently the remains 
                    of a Forest, formerly a very extensive one. At the bottom of the other Valley is the house of which I have spoken, and beyond the enclosures of 
                    this man’s <span change="blue">[Page 8] </span>Farm there are no other – A few old trees remain, relicks of the Forest, a little stream passes 
                    in serpentine windings through the uncultivated valley, where many Cattle were feeding – the Cattle of this country are generally white or 
                    light-coloured; but those were mostly dark brown or black, which made the scene resemble many parts of Scotland.

                    When we sate on the hillside, though we were well contented with the quiet every-day sounds, the lowing of cattle, bleating of sheep, and the very 
                    gentle murmuring of the valley stream, yet we could not but think what a grand effect the sound of the Bugle Horn would have among these mountains. 
                    It is still heard once a year at the Chace I have spoken of, a day of festivity for all the Inhabitants of this District except the poor Deer, the 
                    most ancient of them all. The ascent, even to the top of the mountain, is very easy.
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors"> DW’s description is slightly ambiguous, but it appears that the walkers ascended Beda Fell, then walked 
                            southwest along its ridge before descending into Patterdale via Boredale Hause. See the accompanying map [link] for our best reconstruction 
                            of the route. [Photo: Path up from Dale Head.]

                    When we had accomplished it we had some exceedingly fine mountain views, some of the mountains being resplendent with sunshine, others partly 
                    hidden by clouds. Ulswater was of a dazzling brightness bordered by black hills – the Plain beyond Penrith smooth and bright, (or rather 
                    <hi rend="underline">gleamy</hi>) as the sea or sea Sands. Looked into Boar Dale above Sanwick, deep and bare, a stream winding down it.

                    After having walked a considerable way on the tops of the hills, came in view of Glenriddin and the <span change="blue">[Page 9] </span>mountains 
                    above Grisdale. Luff then took us aside, before we had begun to descend, to a small Ruin which was formerly a Chapel or place of worship where the 
                    Inhabitants of Martindale and Patterdale were accustomed to meet on Sabbath days.
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors"> This tiny ruin is sometimes called the “Chapel in the Hause” due to its location at Boredale Hause, midway 
                            between Place Fell and Angletarn Pikes. From that place, the walkers had a short, direct descent back to the Luffs’ house.

                    There are now no traces by which you could discover that the Building had been different from a common sheep-fold; the loose stones, and the few 
                    which yet remain piled up are the same as those which lie about on the mountain; but the shape of the building, being oblong, is not that of a 
                    common sheep-fold, and it stands East and West. Whether it was ever consecrated ground or not I know not; but the place may be kept holy in the 
                    memory of some now living in Patterdale; for it was the means of preserving the life of a poor old man last summer who, having gone up the mountain 
                    to gather peats, had been overtaken by a storm, and could not find his way down again. He happened to be near the remains of the old Chapel, and, 
                    in a corner of it, he contrived, by laying turf and ling
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors"> A name commonly applied to plants of the heather family. Ling was sometimes used for thatching.</note>
                    and stones from one wall to the other, to make a shelter from the wind, and there he lay all night. The Woman who had sent him on his errand began 
                    to grow uneasy towards <span change="blue">[Page 10]</span> night and the neighbours went out to seek him. At that time the old Man had housed himself 
                    in his nest, and he heard the voices of the men; but could not make <hi rend="underline">them</hi> hear, the wind being so loud, and he was 
                    afraid to leave the spot least he should not be able to find it again, so he remained there all night, and they returned to their homes giving him 
                    up for lost; but the next morning the same persons discovered him huddled up in the sheltered nook. He was, at first, stupefied and unable to move; 
                    but after he had eaten and drunk, and recollected himself a little, he walked down the mountain, and did not afterwards seem to have suffered.

                    As we descend, the Vale of Patterdale appears very simple and grand with its two heads, Deep-dale, and Brotherswater or Hartsop. It is remarkable 
                    that two pairs of Brothers should have been drowned in that Lake. There is a tradition, at least, that it took its name from two who were drowned 
                    there many years ago, and it is a fact that two others did meet that melancholy fate about twenty years since. It was upon a New-year’s Day. 
                    Their Mother had sent them to thresh some corn, and they, probably thinking it hard to be so tasked when all others were keeping holiday, stole 
                    out to slide upon the ice and were both drowned. A Neighbour <span change="blue">[Page 11]</span> who had seen them fall through the ice, though not 
                    near enough to be certain, guessed who they were, and went to the mother to inquire after her sons. She replied that they were in the Barn 
                    threshing, “Nay,” said the Man, [“]they are not there, I am sure, and it is not likely today.” The Woman went with him to the Barn and the Boys 
                    were gone: he was then confirmed, and told her that he believed that they were drowned. It is said that they were found locked in each other’s 
                    arms. I was exceedingly tired when we reached home, owing to the steepness and roughness of the peat track by which we descended. I lay down on the 
                    Sofa in Mrs. Luff’s parlour and was asleep in three minutes———. A fine moonlight night – a thick fog in the middle of the Vale, which 
                    disheartened William about the situation of his house. Supped on some of the Fish caught by the Fishermen at the foot of Place Fell. We thought

                    by the mists the other day. It had been a sharp frost in the night, and the grass and trees were yet wet. We observed the lemon-coloured leaves

                    The day cleared at one o’clock and after dinner, at a little before three we set forward. The pony was bogged in Tom’s field, &amp; I was obliged 
                    to dismount – Went over Soulby Fell. Before we reached Ulswater the <span change="blude">[Page 15]</span> sun shone, and only a few scattered 
                    clouds remained on the hills except at the tops of the very highest – the Lake perfectly calm – We had a delightful journey. At the 
                    beginning of the first Park William got upon the pony, and, betwixt a walk and a run, I kept pace with him while he trotted to the next gate; 
                    then I mounted again. We were joined by two Travellers; like ourselves, with one white horse between them. We went on in company till we came 
                    near to Patterdale, trotting most of the time. The Trees in Gowborough Park were very beautiful, the hawthorns leafless – their round 
                    heads covered with rich red berries, and adorned with arches of green brambles, and eglantine hung with glossy hips – Many birches yet 
                    tricked out in full foliage of bright yellow – Oaks brown or leafless – the smooth branches of the ashes bare – most of the 
                    alders green as in spring. I think I have more pleasure in looking at deer than any other animals, perhaps chiefly from their living in a more 
                    natural state. At the end of Gowborough Park, a large Troop of them were moving slowly, or standing still, among the fern. I was grieved when our 
                    companions startled them with a whistle, disturbing a beautiful image of grave simplicity and thoughtful enjoyment; for I could have fancied that 
                    even they were partaking with me a sensation of the solemnity of the closing day. <span change="blue">[Page 16] </span>The sun had been set some time, 
                    though we could only just perceive that the daylight was partly gone, and the Lake was more brilliant than before. I dismounted again at Stybarrow 
                    Crag,
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors"> “Stybarrow Crag is a lofty promontory, deeply scarred by winds and torrents, terminating a mountainous 
                            ridge that descends from Helvellyn. A road winds beneath this crag, commanding a fine view of Ullswater” (Rose, 
                            <title level="m">Westmorland,  Cumberland, Durham</title>, 179). [Illustration: photo of Stybarrow from Silver Crag.]

                    and William rode till we came almost to Glenriddin. Found the Luffs at tea in the kitchen. After tea set out again; Luff accompanied me on foot and 
                    William continued to ride till we came to the foot of Brothers-water. – A delightful evening – the Seven Stars close to the hill 
                    tops in Patterdale – all the stars seemed brighter than usual. The steeps were reflected in Brothers-water, and above the Lake appeared like 
                    enormous black perpendicular walls. The torrents of Kirkstone had been swoln by the rains, and filled the mountain Pass with their roaring, which 
                    added greatly to the solemnity of our walk – the stars in succession took their stations on the mountain tops. Behind us, when we had 
                    climbed very high we saw one light in the Vale at a great distance, like a large star, a solitary one, in the gloomy region – all the 
                    cheerfulness of the scene was in the sky above us. Found Mary &amp; the children in bed – no fire – luckily William was warm with 
                    walking, and I not cold, having wrapped myself up most carefully, &amp; the night being mild.</hi>

                  </hi> The notebook known as DCMS 51 includes the earliest extant version of Dorothy’s 
                <title level="a"> Ullswater Excursion</title> plus fragments and draft introductions for the Ullswater text published in William’s 
                <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> (1823).
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">The fragmentary draft materials—not included in our edition—appear on pp. 1–5 of the notebook. Owen and 
                    Smyser account for them in the apparatus of <title level="m">Prose</title>, 2:368–78.
                    </note>
                Here, we transcribe Dorothy’s complete version, headed <title level="a">November 1805.</title> To the extent possible, we represent exactly

                 The general color of the trees was brown, rather that of<lb/>

                 Ruin, which was formerly a Chapel, or place of worship,<lb/>

                 accustomed to meet on Sabbath days. There are now<lb/>

                 is not that of a common Sheep-fold; and it stands<lb/>
                 East &amp; West. Whether it was ever consecrated ground<lb/>
                 or not, I do not know; but the place may be kept<lb/>
                 holy in the memory of some now living in Patter-<lb/>
                 dale; for it was the means of preserving the<lb/>
                 life of a poor old Man last summer who, having gone up<lb/>
                 the mountain to gather peats together, had been overtaken<lb/>
                 by a storm, and could not find his way down again.<lb/>
                 He happened to be near the remains of the old Chapel<lb/>
                 and in a corner of it he contrived, by laying turf, &amp; ling,<lb/>

               <p>and stones in a corner of it from one wall to the other, to make<lb/>
                a shelter from the wind, and there he sate all night.<lb/>
                The Woman who had sent him on his errand began to<lb/>
                grow uneasy towards evening, &amp; the Neighbours went to<lb/>
                seek him. At that time the old Man had housed himself<lb/>
                in his nest, &amp; he heard the voices of the men; but could not<lb/>
                make himself heard, the wind being so loud; &amp; he was afraid<lb/>
                to leave the spot, least he should not be able to find it<lb/>
                again, so he remained there all night, and they return-<lb/>
                ed to their homes, giving him up for lost; but the next<lb/>
                morning the same persons discovered him, huddled up in<lb/>
                the sheltered nook. He was at first stupefied, &amp; unable<lb/>
                to move, yet after he had eaten and drunk, &amp; recollected<lb/>
                himself a little he walked down the Mountain, and his<lb/>
                health did not afterwards seem to have suffered. As we<lb/>
                descend the Vale of Patterdale appears very simple<lb/>
                and grand with its two heads, Deep dale, &amp; Brothers-water<lb/>
                or Hartsop. It is remarkable that two pairs of Brothers<lb/>
                should have been drowned in that Lake. There is a traditi-<lb/>
                on, at least, that <del rend="strike">two were drowned there</del> it took its<lb/>
                name from two who were drowned there many years<lb/>
                ago; and it is a fact that two others did meet that<lb/>
                melancholy fate about twenty years since. It was after<lb/>
                a New-year’s-day. Their Mother had sent them to thresh<lb/>
                some corn, and they (probably thinking it hard to be so <lb/>
                tasked when all others were keeping holiday) stole out<lb/>
                to slide upon the ice, and were both drowned. A neighbour<lb/>

               <p>who had seen them fall through the ice, though not near<lb/>
                 enough to be certain, <hi rend="underline">guessed who</hi> they were, &amp; went to the Mother<lb/>
                 to enquire after her Sons. She replied that “they were threshing<lb/>
                 in the Barn.” “Nay,” said the Man, “they are not there, nor is<lb/>
                 it likely today.” The Woman went with him to the Barn,<lb/>
                 and the Boys were gone. He was then convinced of the truth,<lb/>
                 and told her that they were drowned. It is said that they<lb/>
                 were found locked in each other’s arms. I was exceedingly<lb/>
                 tired when we reached M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Luff’s house, owing to the<lb/>
                 steepness and roughness of the peat track down which<lb/>
                 we descended. I lay down on the Sofa, &amp; was asleep in<lb/>

                 to ford the Emont at the Mill, but the Pony could not<lb/>

                 to William. Very cold before we reached Park House<lb/>
                 — Carpets &amp; chairs spread upon the grass. Derwent ran <lb/>

                transcription is based on a 16-page fair copy of <title level="a">Ullswater Excursion</title> in Dorothy
                Wordsworth’s hand that seems to have been made for Lady Margaret Beaumont sometime
                in late 1805 or early 1806. It is known as the <title level="a">Coleorton Manuscript</title> both in
                reference to the Beaumonts’ Leicestershire estate, Coleorton Hall, and its being
                part of the Coleorton Papers at the Morgan Library in New York City. The manuscript
                (catalog #MA 1581) bears a descriptive title, “a mountainous ramble by D Wordsworth
                sister to <hi rend="underline">the poet,</hi>” likely added by Lady Beaumont.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">This label appears to be in Lady Beaumont’s 
                    hand, though the rest of the manuscript is in DW’s own best handwriting.

               <p>William and Mary returned from Parkhouse by the Patter-<lb/>
                dale road along with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Clarkson, having<lb/>
                made a delightful excursion of three days. They had<lb/>

                on Wednesday or Thursday if the weather conti-<lb/>
                nued favorable. It was not very promising on <lb/>
                Wednesday; but, having been fine for so long a time,<lb/>
                we thought that there would not be an entire change<lb/>
                all at once, therefore on a damp and gloomy morn-<lb/>
                ing we set forward, W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> on foot, and I upon the<lb/>
                pony with W.’s great coat slung over the saddle<lb/>
                crutch and a wallet containing our bundle of<lb/>
                “needments.” As we went along the mists gathered<lb/>
                upon the vallies, and it even <hi rend="underline">rained</hi> all the <lb/>
                way to the head of Patterdale; but there was<lb/>
                never a drop [two illegible deleted words] upon my habit larger<lb/>
                than the smallest pearls upon a Lady’s ring.<lb/>
                The trees of the larger Island upon Rydale<lb/>
                Lake were of the most gorgeous colours, the<lb/>
                whole Island reflected in the water, as I remember<lb/>
                once in particular to have seen it with dear<lb/>

               <p>Coleridge, when either he or William observed that<lb/>
                the rocky shore spotted and streaked with purplish<lb/>
                brown heath and its image in the water together<lb/>
                were like an immense catterpillar, such as when<lb/>
                we were children we used to call <hi rend="underline">Woolly Boys</hi>,<lb/>
                from their hairy coats. I had been a little coward<lb/>
                -ly when we left home, fearing that heavy rains<lb/>
                might detain us at Patterdale; but as the mists<lb/>
                thickened our enjoyment encreased, and my hopes<lb/>
                grew bolder; and when we were at the top of <lb/>
                Kirkstone (though we could not see fifty yards<lb/>
                before us) we were as happy Travellers as ever<lb/>
                paced side by side on a holiday ramble. At<lb/>
                such a time and in such a place every scat-<lb/>
                -tered stone the size of one’s head becomes a com<lb/>
                -panion: there is a fragment of an old wall at<lb/>
                the top of Kirkstone, which, magnified yet ob<lb/>
                -scured as it was by the mist, was scarcely less<lb/>
                interesting to us when we cast our eyes upon it<lb/>
                than the view of a noble monument of anci<lb/>
                -ent grandeur has been — yet this same pile<lb/>
                of stones we had never before observed. When<lb/>
                we had descended considerably the fields of Hartsop<lb/>
                below Brotherswater were first seen, like a Lake <lb/>
                coloured by the reflection of yellow clouds, I <lb/>

               <p>mistook them for the water; but soon after we saw<lb/>
                the Lake itself gleaming faintly with a grey steely<lb/>
                brightness; then appeared the brown oaks, and the<lb/>
                birches of splendid colour, and, when we came still<lb/>
                nearer to the valley, the cottages under their tufts<lb/>
                of trees and the old Hall of Hartsop with its long<lb/>
                irregular front and elegant chimneys. We had<lb/>
                eaten our dinner under the shelter of a Sheep-fold<lb/>
                by the bridge at the foot of the mountain,<lb/>
                having tethered the pony at the entrance, where<lb/>
                it stood without one impatient beating of a<lb/>
                foot — I could not but love it for its meekness,<lb/>
                and indeed I thought we were selfish to enjoy<lb/>
                our meal so heartily while his poor jaws were<lb/>
                tethered by the curb bridle. We reached M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                  <lb/>
                Luff’s about two hours before tea-time.<lb/>

                Blowick. Luff joined us by the way. The wind<lb/>
                was strong and drove the clouds forward along<lb/>
                the side of the hill above our heads; four or<lb/>

               <p>black Yew Trees on the crag above Luff’s house were<lb/>
                striking objects, close under or seen through the <lb/>
                flying mists. I do not know what to say of<lb/>
                Blowick; for to attempt to <hi rend="underline">describe</hi> the place<lb/>
                would be absurd when you for whom I write have<lb/>
                been there, or may go thither as soon as you like.<lb/>
                When we stood upon the naked Crag upon the Com<lb/>
                -mon overlooking its <hi rend="sup">x</hi> woods &amp; bush-besprinkled
                fields,<lb/>
                the Lake, Clouds, and Mists were all in motion to<lb/>
                the sound of sweeping winds — the Church and Cottages<lb/>
                of Patterdale scarcely visible from the brightness<lb/>
                of the thin mist. Looking backwards toward<lb/>
                the Foot of the Water the scene less visionary —<lb/>
                Place Fell steady and bold as a lion — the whole<lb/>
                Lake driving down like a great river — waves <lb/>
                dancing round the small Islands. We walked<lb/>
                to the house; the Owner was salving sheep in<lb/>
                the barn — an appearance of poverty and decay<lb/>
                every where; — he asked us if we wanted to pur :<lb/>
                -chase the estate. We could not but stop fre -<lb/>
                -quently both in going and returning to look at<lb/>
                the exquisite beauty of the woods opposite. The<lb/>
                general colour of the trees was dark brown,<lb/>
                rather that of ripe hazel nuts; but towards<lb/>

               <p>the water there were yet beds of green, and, in some of<lb/>
                the hollow places in the highest part of the woods, the<lb/>
                trees were of a yellow colour, and, through the glittering<lb/>
                light, they looked like masses of clouds as you see<lb/>
                them gathered together in the West, and tinged with<lb/>
                the golden light of the sun. After dinner we walk<lb/>
                -ed with M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Luff up the Vale; I had never had an<lb/>
                idea of the extent and width of it in passing thro’<lb/>
                along the road on the other side. We walked along<lb/>
                the path which leads from house to house; two or<lb/>
                three times it took us through some of those copses<lb/>
                or groves that cover every little hillock in the mid<lb/>
                -dle of the lower part of the Vale, making an<lb/>
                intricate and beautiful intermixture of lawn and<lb/>
                woodland. We left William to prolong his walk; and when<lb/>
                he came into the house he told us that he had pitched<lb/>
                upon the spot where he should like to build a house<lb/>
                better than in any other he had <hi rend="sup">ever</hi> yet seen. M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Luff went<lb/>
                with him by moonlight to view it. The Vale looked<lb/>
                as if it were filled with white light <del rend="strike">when the moon</del>

                when the moon had climbed up to the middle of the<lb/>

                the eastern hills were a black shade, those on the<lb/>
                opposite side were almost as bright as snow.<lb/>
                M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Luff’s large white Dog lay in the moonshine<lb/>
                upon the round knoll under the old yew tree,<lb/>

                  <hi rend="indent7">It rained till near ten o’clock, but<lb/>
                  </hi>
                a little after that time, it being likely for a tolera-<lb/>
                -bly fine day, we packed up bread and cold meat, and,<lb/>
                with Luff’s servant to help to row, set forward in the<lb/>
                Boat. As we proceeded the day grew finer — clouds<lb/>
                and sunny gleams on the mountains. In a grand<lb/>
                Bay under Place Fell we saw three Fishermen with<lb/>
                a Boat dragging a net, and rowed up to them.<lb/>
                They had just brought the net ashore, and hun<lb/>
                -dreds of fish were leaping in their prison. They<lb/>
                were all of one kind, what are called Skellies.<lb/>
                After we had left them the Fishermen continu<lb/>
                -ed their work, a picturesque group under the<lb/>
                lofty and bare crags; the whole scene was very<lb/>
                grand, a raven croaking on the mountain above<lb/>
                our heads. — Landed at Sanwick — the man took<lb/>
                the Boat home, and we pursued our journey<lb/>
                towards the village along a beautiful summer<lb/>
                path, at first through a copse by the Lake<lb/>
                side, then through green fields — the Village and<lb/>
                Brook very pretty, shut out from mountains and<lb/>
                Lakes — it reminded me of Somersetshire — Passed<lb/>
                by Harry Hebson’s house — I longed to go in for<lb/>
                the sake of former times. W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> went up one side<lb/>

               <p>of the Vale and we the other, and he joined us<lb/>
                after having crossed the one-arched bridge above the<lb/>
                Church — a beautiful view of the church with its <lb/>
                “bare ring of mossy wall” and single Yew Tree. At<lb/>
                the last house in the Vale we were kindly<lb/>
                greeted by the Master, who was sitting at the door<lb/>
                salving sheep — he invited us to go in and see a <lb/>
                room lately built by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hazel for his accommo<lb/>
                -dation at the yearly chace of red Deer in his<lb/>
                Forests at the head of these Dales; the room is fit-<lb/>
                -ted up in the sportsman’s style, with a single cup-<lb/>
                -board for bottles and glasses &amp;c, some strong chairs, and<lb/>
                a large dining-table; and ornamented with the horns <lb/>
                of the stags caught at these Hunts for many years<lb/>
                back, with the length of the last race they ran<lb/>
                recorded under each. We ate our dinner here; the<lb/>
                good woman treated us with excellent butter and new<lb/>
                oat bread, and, after drinking some of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hazel’s<lb/>
                strong Ale we were well prepared to face the<lb/>
                mountain, which we began to climb almost immedi-<lb/>
                -ately. Martindale divides itself into two dales<lb/>
                at the head. In one of these (that to the left)<lb/>
                there is no house to be seen, nor any building<lb/>
                but a cattle shed on the side of a hill which<lb/>
                is sprinkled over with wood, evidently the remains <lb/>
                of a Forest, formerly a very extensive one. At<lb/>
                the bottom of the other Valley is the house of which<lb/>
                I have spoken, and beyond the enclosures of this man’s<lb/>

               </p>
               <p>Farm there are no other. A few old trees remain, relicks<lb/>
                of the Forest, a little stream passes in serpentine wind-<lb/>
                -ings through the uncultivated valley, where many Cattle<lb/>
                were feeding — the Cattle of this country are generally<lb/>
                white or light-coloured; but those were mostly dark<lb/>
                brown or black, which made the scene resemble ma-<lb/>
                -ny parts of Scotland. When we sate on the hill-<lb/>
                -side, though we were well contented with the quiet<lb/>
                every-day sounds, the lowing of cattle, bleating of<lb/>
                sheep, and the very gentle murmuring of the valley<lb/>
                stream, yet we could not but think what a grand<lb/>
                effect the sound of the Bugle Horn would have<lb/>
                among these mountains. It is still heard once<lb/>
                a year at the Chace I have spoken of, a day<lb/>
                of festivity for all the Inhabitants of this Dis-<lb/>
                trict except the poor Deer, the most ancient <lb/>
                of them all. The ascent, even to the top of the<lb/>
                mountain, is very easy. When we had accomplish-<lb/>
                -ed it we had some exceedingly fine mountain<lb/>
                views, some of the mountains being resplendent<lb/>
                with sunshine, others partly hidden by clouds. <lb/>
                Ulswater was of a dazzling brightness bordered by<lb/>
               black hills — the plain beyond Penrith smooth<lb/>
                and bright, (or rather <hi rend="underline">gleamy</hi>) as the sea or sea<lb/>
                Sands. Looked into Boar Dale above Sanwick,<lb/>
                deep and bare, a stream winding down it. After<lb/>
                having walked a considerable way on the tops of<lb/>
                the hills, came in view of Glenriddin and the <lb/>

               <p>
                  <span change="brown">[end page 8]</span>
               </p>
               <p>mountains above Grisdale. Luff then took us aside,<lb/>
                before we had begun to descend, to a small Ruin<lb/>
                which was formerly a Chapel or place of worship<lb/>
                where the Inhabitants of Martindale and Patterdale<lb/>
                were accustomed to meet on Sabbath days. There<lb/>
                are now no traces by which you could discover<lb/>
                that the Building had been different from a com-<lb/>
                -mon sheep-fold; the loose stones, and the few<lb/>
                which yet remain piled up are the same as<lb/>
                those which lie about on the mountain; but<lb/>
                the shape of the building, being oblong, is not<lb/>
                that of a common sheep-fold, and it stands East<lb/>
                and West. Whether it was ever consecrated ground<lb/>
                or not I know not; but the place may be kept<lb/>
                holy in the memory of some now living in Pat-<lb/>
                -terdale; for it was the means of preserving the <lb/>
                life of a poor old man last summer who, hav-<lb/>
                -ing gone up the mountain to gather peats, had<lb/>
                been overtaken by a storm, and could not<lb/>
                find his way down again. He happened to be<lb/>
                near the remains of the old Chapel, and, in <lb/>
                a corner of it, he contrived, by laying turf and<lb/>
                ling and stones from one wall to the other, to<lb/>
                make a shelter from the wind, and there he<lb/>
                lay all night. The Woman who had sent him<lb/>
                on his errand began to grow uneasy towards<lb/>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span change="brown">[end page 9]</span>
               </p>
               <p>night and the neighbours went out to seek him.<lb/>
                At that time the old Man had housed himself in<lb/>
                his nest, and he heard the voices of the men; but<lb/>
                could not make <hi rend="underline">them</hi> hear, the wind being so loud,<lb/>
                and he was afraid to leave the spot least he <lb/>
                should not be able to find it again, so he remained<lb/>
                  <!--Should we put an add rend="sup" for this carrot thing?-->
                there all night, and they returned to their homes<lb/>
                giving him up for lost; but the next morning the<lb/>
                same persons discovered him huddled up in the she[l]tered<lb/>
                work. He was, at first, stupefied and unable to move;<lb/>
                but after he had eaten and drunk, and recollected<lb/>
                himself a little, he walked down the mountain, and did<lb/>
                not afterwards seem to have suffered. As we descend,<lb/>
                the Vale of Patterdale appears very simple and grand<lb/>
                with its two heads, Deep-dale, and Brotherswater or Hart<lb/>
                Hartsop. It is remarkable that two pairs of Bro-<lb/>
                -thers should have been drowned in that Lake. There<lb/>
                is a tradition, at least, that it took its name<lb/>
                from two who were drowned there many years<lb/>
                ago, and it is a fact that two others did meet<lb/>
                that melancholy fate about twenty years since. <lb/>
                It was upon a New-year’s Day. Their Mother had<lb/>
                sent them to thresh some corn, and they, probably<lb/>
                thinking it hard to be so tasked when all others<lb/>
                were keeping holiday, stole out to slide upon<lb/>
                the ice and were both drowned. A Neighbour who<lb/>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span change="brown">[end page 10]</span>
               </p>
               <p>who had seen them fall through the ice, though not near<lb/>
                enough to be <hi rend="underline">certain</hi>, guessed who they were, and went<lb/>
                to the mother to enquire after her sons. She replied<lb/>
                that they were in the Barn threshing, “Nay,” said<lb/>
                the Man, they are not there, I am sure, and it<lb/>
                is not likely today.” The Woman went with<lb/>
                him to the Barn and the Boys were gone:<lb/>
                he was then confirmed, and told her that he believ-<lb/>
                -ed that they were drowned. It is said that they<lb/>
                were found locked in each other’s arms. I was<lb/>
                exceedingly tired when we reached home, owing<lb/>
                to the steepness and roughness of the peat track<lb/>
                by which we descended. I lay down on the<lb/>
                Sofa in M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Luff’s parlour and was asleep<lb/>
                in three minutes – – – – –. A fine moonlight<lb/>
                night — a thick fog in the middle of the<lb/>
                Vale, which disheartened William about the<lb/>
                situation of his house. Supped on some of the<lb/>
                Fish caught by the Fishermen at the foot<lb/>
                of Place Fell. We thought them excellent.<lb/>

                we were at breakfast we heard suddenly the tidings<lb/>

                -gar. Went to the Inn to make further inquiries – <lb/>

               <p>rejoicings at Penrith. Returned by William’s rock and<lb/>
                grove, and were so much pleased with the spot that<lb/>
                W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> determined to buy it if possible, therefore we

                -ply to Thomas Wilkinson to negotiate for him<lb/>
                with the owner. We went down that side of the <lb/>
                Lake opposite to Stybarrow Crag: I dismounted,<lb/>
                and we sate some time under the same rock as<lb/>
                before, above Blowick. Owing to the brightness of<lb/>
                the sunshine the Church and other buildings were<lb/>
                even more concealed from us than by the mists<lb/>
                the other day. It had been a sharp frost in the <lb/>
                night, and the grass and trees were yet wet.<lb/>
                We observed the lemon-coloured leaves of the birches<lb/>
                in the wood below, as the wind turned them to the <lb/>
                sun, sparkle, or rather <hi rend="underline">flash</hi>, like diamonds. The <lb/>
                day continued unclouded to the end. We had a de-<lb/>
                -lightful ride and walk, for it was both to both of <lb/>
                us. We led the horse under Place Fell, &amp;, though<lb/>
                I mostly rode when the way was good, William<lb/>
                sometimes mounted to rest himself. Called at<lb/>
                Eusemere. Went by Bower Bank, intending to<lb/>
                ford the Emont at the Mill; but the pony would<lb/>
                not carry us both, so, after many attempts, I rode<lb/>
                over myself and a Girl followed me on another<lb/>
                horse to take back the pony to William. Very cold <lb/>
               </p>

               <p>before we reached Park House. Derwent ran to meet<lb/>
                us. Sate in the kitchen till the parlour fire was<lb/>
                lighted and then <hi rend="underline">enjoyed </hi>a comfortable
                    dish of tea.<lb/>
                After tea William went to Thomas Wilkinson’s and<lb/>
                to Brougham.<lb/>

                W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> and Miss Green set out on foot; but she<lb/>
                had not walked long before she took a seat behind<lb/>
                Sara. Crossed the Ford at Yanworth ––– Found Tho-<lb/>

                he chearfully laid down the spade and walked<lb/>
                by our side with William. We left our horses at <lb/>
                the Mill below Brougham, and walked through<lb/>
                the woods till we came to the Quarry, where the<lb/>
                road ends, the very place which has been the<lb/>
                Boundary of some of the happiest of the walks<lb/>
                of my youth. The sun did not shine when we were<lb/>
                there; and it was mid-day, therefore if it had shone,<lb/>
                the light could not have been the same; yet so<lb/>
                vividly did I call to mind those walks that<lb/>
                when I was in the wood I almost seemed to see<lb/>
                the same rich light of evening upon the trees<lb/>
                which I had seen in those happy hours. My heart <lb/>

               <p>was full; and I could not but grieve that any stran-<lb/>
                -gers were with us. At this time the Path was scarce<lb/>
                -ly traceable by the eye, all the ground being covered <lb/>
                with withered leaves, which I was very sorry for, W<hi rend="sup">m</hi>

                having spoken of the beauty of it with so much de<lb/>

                Scrambled along under the Quarry; then came to T.<lb/>
                Wilkinson’s new path. We spent three delightful <lb/>
                hours by the River side and in the woods. Called at<lb/>
                Richard Bowman’s. We had a pleasant ride home;<lb/>
                Sara and I stopped at Red Hills while William<lb/>
                went over the Ford to T. Wilkinson’s. The House<lb/>
                untidy and uncomfortable — a little Girl never<lb/>
                ceased rocking the Baby in the cradle. We asked <lb/>
                if it would not sleep without rocking, and the<lb/>
                Mother said “No, for she was used to it” — Reached<lb/>
                Park House at ten o’clock — Joanna had waited<lb/>
                dinner and tea for us.<lb/>

                a Book lent him by Thomas Wilkinson. I<lb/>
                read Castle Rackrent. The day cleared at<lb/>
                one o’clock and after dinner, at a little before<lb/>
                three we set forward. The pony was bogged in <lb/>
                Tom’s field &amp; I was obliged to dismount — Went <lb/>
                over Soulby Fell. Before we reached Ulswater the <lb/>

               <span change="brown">[end page 14]</span>
               <p>sun shone, and only a few scattered clouds remained<lb/>
                on the hills except at the tops of the very highest –<lb/>
                the Lake perfectly calm – We had a delightful jour-<lb/>
                -ney. At the beginning of the first Park William<lb/>
                got upon the pony, and, betwixt a walk and a<lb/>
                run, I kept pace with him while he trotted to the<lb/>
                next gate; then I mounted again. We were joined <lb/>
                by two Travellers; like ourselves, with one white horse<lb/>
                between them. We went on in company till we<lb/>
                came near to Patterdale, trotting most of the<lb/>
                time. The Trees in Gowborough Park were very beau-<lb/>
                -tiful, the hawthorns leafless — their round heads cover-<lb/>
                -ed with rich red berries, and adorned with arches of<lb/>
                green brambles, and eglantine hung with glossy hips<lb/>
                — Many birches yet tricked out in full foliage of<lb/>
                bright yellow — Oaks brown or leafless — the smooth<lb/>
                branches of the ashes bare — most of the alders green<lb/>
                as in spring. I think I have more pleasure in look-<lb/>
                -ing at deer than any other animals, perhaps chief-<lb/>
                -ly from their living in a more natural state. At<lb/>
                the end of Gowborough Park, A large Troop of them<lb/>
                were moving slowly, or standing still, among the fern.<lb/>
                I was grieved when our companions startled them with <lb/>
                a whistle, disturbing a beautiful image of grave<lb/>
                simplicity and thoughtful enjoyment; for I could<lb/>
                have fancied that even they were partaking with<lb/>
                me a sensation of the solemnity of the closing day. <lb/>

               <p>The sun had been set some time, though we could only<lb/>
                just perceive that the daylight was partly gone, and<lb/>
                the Lake was more brilliant than before. I dismount-<lb/>
                -ed again at Stybarrow Crag, and William rode till<lb/>
                we came almost to Glenriddin. Found the Luffs at <lb/>
                tea in the kitchen. After tea set out again; Luff<lb/>
                accompanied me on foot and William continued to<lb/>
                ride till we came to the foot of Brothers-water. <lb/>
                — A delightful evening — the Seven Stars close to<lb/>
                the hill tops in Patterdale — all the stars seemed<lb/>
                brighter than usual. The steeps were reflected in Bro-<lb/>
                -thers-water, and above the Lake appeared like enormous black<lb/>
                perpendicular walls. The torrents of Kirkstone had been<lb/>
                swoln by the rains, and filled the mountain Pass<lb/>
                with their roaring, which added greatly to the solem-<lb/>
                -nity of our walk — the stars in succession took their<lb/>
                stations on the mountain tops. Behind us, when we<lb/>
                had climbed very high we saw one light in the Vale<lb/>
                at a great distance, like a large star, a solitary<lb/>
                one, in the gloomy region — all the cheerfulness of<lb/>
                the scene was in the sky above us. Found Mary &amp;<lb/>
                the children in bed — no fire — luckily William was<lb/>
                warm with walking, and I not cold; having wrap-<lb/>
                -ped myself up most carefully, &amp; the night being mild.<lb/>

               <p>Having said so much of a point of view to which few are likely to ascend, I am
                induced to subjoin an account of a short excursion through more accessible parts of
                the country, made at a time when it is seldom seen but by the inhabitants. As the
                journal was written for one acquainted with the general features of the country,
                only those effects and appearances are dwelt upon, which are produced by the
                changeableness of the atmosphere, or belong to the season when the excursion was
                made.
            </p>
               <p>A.D. 1805.—On the 7th of November, on a damp and gloomy morning, we left Grasmere
                Vale, intending to pass a few days on the banks of Ulswater. A mild and dry autumn
                had been unusually favourable to the preservation and beauty of foliage; and, far
                advanced as the season was, the trees on the larger Island of Rydal-mere retained a
                splendour which did not need the heightening of sunshine. We noticed, as we passed,
                that the line of the grey rocky shore of that island, shaggy with variegated bushes
                and shrubs, and spotted and striped with purplish brown heath, indistinguishably
                blending with its image reflected in the still water, produced a curious
                resemblance, both in form and colour, to a richly-coated caterpillar, as it might
                appear through a magnifying glass of extraordinary power. The mists gathered as we
                went along: but, when we reached the top of Kirkstone, we were glad we had not been
                discouraged by the apprehension of bad weather. Though not able to see a hundred
                yards before us, we were more than contented. At such a time, and in such a place,
                every scattered stone the size of one’s head becomes a companion. Near the top of
                the pass is the remnant of an old wall, which (magnified, though obscured, by the
                vapour) might have been taken for a fragment of some monument of ancient
                grandeur,—yet that same pile of stones we had never before even observed. This
                situation, it must be allowed, is not favourable to gaiety; but a pleasing hurry of
                spirits accompanies the surprize occasioned by objects transformed, dilated, or
                distorted, as they are when seen through such a medium. Many of the fragments of
                rock on the top and slopes of Kirkstone, and of similar places are fantastic enough
                in themselves; but the full effect of such impressions can only be had in a state of
                weather when they are not likely to be <emph>sought</emph> for. It was not
                till we had descended considerably that the fields of Hartshope were seen, like a
                lake tinged by the reflection of sunny clouds: I mistook them for Brothers-water,
                but, soon after, we saw that Lake gleaming faintly with a steelly brightness,—then,
                as we continued to descend, appeared the brown oaks, and the birches of lively
                yellow—and the cottages—and the lowly Hall of Hartshope, with its long roof and
                ancient chimneys. During great part of our way to Patterdale, we had rain, or rather
                drizzling vapour; for there was never a drop upon our hair or clothes larger than
                the smallest pearls upon a lady’s ring.
            </p>
               <p>The following morning, incessant rain till 11 o’clock, when the sky began to clear,
                and we walked along the eastern shore of Ulswater towards the farm of Blowick. The
                wind blew strong, and drove the clouds forward, on the side of the mountain above
                our heads;—two storm-stiffened black yew-trees fixed our notice, seen through, or
                under the edge of, the flying mists,—four or five goats were bounding among the
                rocks;—the sheep moved about more quietly, or cowered beneath their sheltering
                places. This is the only part of the country where goats are now found
                <note place="foot" resp="editors"> WW’s note: “A. D. 1805. These also have disappeared.”
                </note>
                ; but this morning, before we had seen these, I was reminded of
                that picturesque animal by two rams of mountain breed, both with Ammonian horns, and
                with beards majestic as that which Michael Angelo has given to his statue of
                Moses.——But to return; when our path had brought us to that part of the naked common
                which overlooks the woods and bush-besprinkled fields of Blowick, the lake, clouds,
                and mists were all in motion to the sound of sweeping winds; —the church and
                cottages of Patterdale scarcely visible, or seen only by fits between the shifting
                vapours. To the northward the scene was less visionary;—Place Fell steady and
                bold;—the whole lake driving onward like a great river—waves dancing round the small
                islands. The house at Blowick was the boundary of our walk; and we returned,
                lamenting to see a decaying and uncomfortable dwelling in a place where sublimity
                and beauty seemed to contend with each other. But these regrets were dispelled by a
                glance on the woods that clothe the opposite steeps of the lake. How exquisite was
                the mixture of sober and splendid hues! The general colouring of the trees was
                brown—rather that of ripe hazel nuts: but towards the water, there were yet beds of
                green, and in the highest parts of the wood, was abundance of yellow foliage, which,
                gleaming through a vapoury lustre, reminded us of masses of clouds, as you see them
                gathered together in the west, and touched with the golden light of the setting
                sun.
            </p>
               <p>After dinner we walked up the Vale: I had never had an idea of its extent and width
                in passing along the public road on the other side. We followed the path that leads
                from house to house; two or three times it took us through some of those copses or
                groves that cover the little hillocks in the middle of the vale, making an intricate
                and pleasing intermixture of lawn and wood. Our fancies could not resist the
                temptation; and we fixed upon a spot for a cottage, which we began to build: and
                finished as easily as castles are raised in the air.—Visited the same spot in the
                evening. I shall say nothing of the moonlight aspect of the situation which had
                charmed us so much in the afternoon; but I wish you had been with us when, in
                returning to our friend’s house, we espied his lady’s large white dog, lying in the
                moonshine upon the round knoll under the old yew-tree in the garden, a romantic
                image—the dark tree and its dark shadow—and the elegant creature, as fair as a
                spirit! The torrents murmured softly: the mountains down which they were falling did
                not, to my sight furnish a back-ground for this Ossianic picture; but I had a
                consciousness of the depth of the seclusion, and that mountains were embracing us on
                all sides; “I saw not, but I <emph>felt</emph> that they were there.”
            </p>
               <p>Friday, November 9th.—Rain, as yesterday, till 10 o’clock , when we took a boat to
                row down the lake. The day improved,—clouds and sunny gleams on the mountains. In
                the large bay under Place Fell, three fishermen were dragging a net, a picturesque
                group beneath the high and bare crags! A raven was seen aloft; not hovering like the
                kite, for that is not the habit of the bird; but passing on with a straight-forward
                perseverance, and timing the motion of its wings to its own croaking. The waters
                were agitated; and the iron tone of the raven’s voice, which strikes upon the ear at
                all times as the more dolorous from its regularity, was in fine keeping with the
                wild scene before our eyes. This carnivorous fowl is a great enemy to the lambs of
                these solitudes; I recollect frequently seeing, when a boy, bunches of unfledged
                ravens suspended from the churchyard gates of H————— for which a reward of
                <emph>so</emph> much a head was given to the adventurous destroyer.—The
                fishermen drew their net ashore, and hundreds of fish were leaping in their prison.
                They were all of the kind called skellies, a sort of fresh-water herring, shoals of
                which may sometimes be seen dimpling or rippling the surface of the lake in calm
                weather. This species is not found, I believe, in any other of these lakes; nor, as
                far as I know, is the chevin, that <emph>spiritless</emph> fish, (though I
                am loth to call it so, for it was a prime favourite with Isaac Walton,) which must
                frequent Ulswater, as I have seen a large shoal passing into the lake from the river
                Emont. <emph>Here</emph> are no pike, and the char are smaller than
                those of the other lakes, and of inferior quality; but the grey trout attains a very
                large size, sometimes weighing above twenty pounds. This lordly creature seems to
                know that “retiredness is a piece of majesty”; for it is scarcely ever caught, or
                even seen, except when it quits the depths of the lake in the spawning season, and
                runs up into the streams, where it is too often destroyed in disregard of the law of
                the land and of nature.
            </p>
               <p>Quitted the boat in the bay of Sandwyke, and pursued our way towards Martindale along
                a pleasant path—at first through a coppice, bordering the lake, then through green
                fields—and came to the village, (if village it may be called, for the houses are
                few, and separated from each other,) a sequestered spot, shut out from the view of
                the lake. Crossed the one-arched bridge, below the chapel, with its “bare ring of
                mossy wall,” and single yew-tree. At the last house in the dale we were greeted by
                the master, who was sitting at his door, with a flock of sheep collected round him,
                for the purpose of smearing them with tar (according to the custom of the season)
                for protection against the winter’s cold. He invited us to enter, and view a room
                built by Mr. Hasell for the accommodation of his friends at the annual chase of red
                deer in his forests at the head of these dales. The room is fitted up in the
                sportsman’s style, with a cupboard for bottles and glasses, with strong chairs, and
                a dining-table; and ornamented with the horns of the stags caught at these hunts for
                a succession of years—the length of the last race each had run being recorded under
                his spreading antlers. The good woman treated us with oaten cake, new and crisp; and
                after this welcome refreshment and rest, we proceeded on our return to Patterdale by
                a short cut over the mountains. On leaving the fields of Sandwyke, while ascending
                by a gentle slope along the valley of Martindale, we had occasion to observe that in
                thinly-peopled glens of this character the general want of wood gives a peculiar
                interest to the scattered cottages embowered in sycamore. Towards its head, this
                valley splits into two parts; and in one of these (that to the left) there is no
                house, nor any building to be seen but a cattle-shed on the side of a hill, which is
                sprinkled over with trees, evidently the remains of an extensive forest. Near the
                entrance of the other division stands the house where we were entertained, and
                beyond the enclosures of that farm there are no other. A few old trees remain,
                relics of the forest, a little stream hastens, though with serpentine windings,
                through the uncultivated hollow, where many cattle were pasturing. The cattle of
                this country are generally white, or light-coloured; but these were dark brown, or
                black, which heightened the resemblance this scene bears to many parts of the
                Highlands of Scotland.—While we paused to rest upon the hill-side, though well
                contented with the quiet every-day sounds—the lowing of cattle, bleating of sheep,
                and the very gentle murmuring of the valley stream, we could not but think what a
                grand effect the music of the bugle-horn would have among these mountains. It is
                still heard once every year, at the chase I have spoken of; a day of festivity for
                the inhabitants of this district except the poor deer, the most ancient of them all.
                Our ascent even to the top was very easy; when it was accomplished we had
                exceedingly fine views, some of the lofty Fells being resplendent with sunshine, and
                others partly shrouded by clouds. Ulswater, bordered by black steeps, was of
                dazzling brightness: the plain beyond Penrith smooth and bright, or rather gleamy,
                as the sea or sea sands. Looked down into Boardale, which, like Stybarrow, has been
                named from the wild swine that formerly abounded here; but it has now no sylvan
                covert, being smooth and bare, a long, narrow, deep, cradle-shaped glen, lying so
                sheltered that one would be pleased to see it planted by human hands, there being a
                sufficiency of soil; and the trees would be sheltered almost like shrubs in a
                green-house.—After having walked some way along the top of the hill, came in view of
                Glenriddin and the mountains at the head of Grisdale.—Before we began to descend,
                turned aside to a small ruin, called at this day the chapel, where it is said the
                inhabitants of Martindale and Patterdale were accustomed to assemble for worship.
                There are now no traces from which you could infer for what use the building had
                been erected; the loose stones and the few which yet continue piled up resemble
                those which lie elsewhere on the mountain; but the shape of the building having been
                oblong, its remains differ from those of a common sheep-fold; and it has stood east
                and west. Scarcely did the Druids, when they fled to these fastnesses, perform their
                rites in any situation more exposed to disturbance from the elements. One cannot
                pass by without being reminded that the rustic psalmody must have had the
                accompaniment of many a wildly-whistling blast; and what dismal storms must have
                often drowned the voice of the preacher! As we descend Patterdale opens upon the eye
                in grand simplicity, skreened by mountains, and proceeding from two heads, Deepdale
                and Hartshope, where lies the little lake of Brotherswater, named in old maps
                Broaderwater, and probably rightly so; for Bassenthwaite Mere at this day, is
                familiarly called Broadwater; but the change in the appellation of this small lake
                or pool (if it be a corruption) may have been assisted by some melancholy accident
                similar to what happened about twenty years ago, when two brothers were drowned
                there, having gone out to take their holiday pleasure upon the ice on a new-year’s
                day.
            </p>
               <p>A rough and precipitous peat track brought us down to our friend’s house.—Another
                fine moonlight night; but a thick fog rising from the neighbouring river, enveloped
                the rocky and wood-crested knoll on which our fancy-cottage had been erected; and,
                under the damp cast upon my feelings, I consoled myself with moralising on the folly
                of hasty decisions in matters of importance, and the necessity of having at least
                one year’s knowledge of a place before you realise airy suggestions in solid
                stone.
            </p>
               <p>Saturday, November 10th. At the breakfast-table tidings reached us of the death of
                Lord Nelson, and of the victory at Trafalgar. Sequestered as we were from the
                sympathy of a crowd, we were shocked to hear that the bells had been ringing
                joyously at Penrith to celebrate the triumph. In the rebellion of the year 1745,
                people fled with their valuables from the open country to Patterdale, as a place of
                refuge secure from the incursions of strangers. At that time, news such as we had
                heard might have been long in penetrating so far into the recesses of the mountains;
                but now, as you know, the approach is easy, and the communication, in summer time,
                almost hourly: nor is this strange, for travellers after pleasure are become not
                less active, and more numerous than those who formerly left their homes for purposes
                of gain. The priest on the banks of the remotest stream of Lapland will talk
                familiarly of Buonaparte’s last conquests, and discuss the progress of the French
                revolution, having acquired much of his information from adventurers impelled by
                curiosity alone.
            </p>
               <p>The morning was clear and cheerful after a night of sharp frost. At 10 o’clock we
                took our way on foot towards Pooley Bridge, on the same side of the lake we had
                coasted in a boat the day before.—Looked backwards to the south from our favourite
                station above Blowick. The dazzling sunbeams striking upon the church and village,
                while the earth was steaming with exhalations not traceable in other quarters,
                rendered their forms even more indistinct than the partial and flitting veil of
                unillumined vapour had done two days before. The grass on which we trod, and the
                trees in every thicket were dripping with melted hoar-frost. We observed the
                lemon-coloured leaves of the birches, as the breeze turned them to the sun, sparkle,
                or rather <emph>flash</emph>, like diamonds, and the leafless purple twigs
                were tipped with globes of shining crystal.
            </p>
               <p>The day continued delightful, and unclouded to the end. I will not describe the
                country which we slowly travelled through, nor relate our adventures; and will only
                add, that on the afternoon of the 13th we returned along the banks of Ulswater by
                the usual road. The lake was in deep repose after the agitations of a wet and stormy
                morning. The trees in Gowbarrow park were in that state when what is gained by the
                disclosure of their bark and branches compensates, almost, for the loss of foliage,
                exhibiting the variety which characterises the point of time between autumn and
                winter. The hawthorns were leafless; their round heads covered with rich red
                berries, and adorned with arches of green brambles, and eglantines hung with glossy
                hips; and the grey trunks of some of the ancient oaks, which in the summer season
                might have been regarded only for their venerable majesty, now attracted notice by a
                pretty embellishment of green mosses and fern intermixed with russet leaves retained
                by those slender outstarting twigs which the veteran tree would not have tolerated
                in his strength. The smooth silver branches of the ashes were bare; most of the
                alders as green as the Devonshire cottage-myrtle that weathers the snows of
                Christmas.—Will you accept it as some apology for my having dwelt so long on the
                woodland ornaments of these scenes—that artists speak of the trees on the banks of
                Ulswater, and especially along the bays of Stybarrow crags, as having a peculiar
                character of picturesque intricacy in their stems and branches, which their rocky
                stations and the mountain winds have combined to give them?
            </p>
               <p>At the end of Gowbarrow park a large herd of deer were either moving slowly or
                standing still among the fern. I was sorry when a chance companion, who had joined
                us by the way, startled them with a whistle, disturbing an image of grave simplicity
                and thoughtful enjoyment; for I could have fancied that those natives of this wild
                and beautiful region were partaking with us a sensation of the solemnity of the
                closing day. The sun had been set some time; and we could perceive that the light
                was fading away from the coves of Helvellyn, but the lake under a luminous sky, was
                more brilliant than before.
            </p>
               <p>After tea at Patterdale, set out again:— a fine evening; the seven stars close to the
                mountain-top; all the stars seemed brighter than usual. The steeps were reflected in
                Brotherswater, and, above the lake, appeared like enormous black perpendicular
                walls. The Kirkstone torrents had been swoln by the rains, and now filled the
                mountain pass with their roaring, which added greatly to the solemnity of our walk.
                Behind us, when we had climbed to a great height, we saw one light, very distinct,
                in the vale, like a large red star—a solitary one in the gloomy region. The
                cheerfulness of the scene was in the sky above us.
            </p>
               <p>Reached home a little before midnight.</p>

                They touch on several concerns, including William’s struggles to finish various poetic projects, the rapid growth of William and Mary’s family, 
                the prospect of being forced to leave Grasmere, Dorothy’s shock over the recent deaths of her brother John and Admiral Nelson, and her fears over 
                the seemingly interminable war with France, along with related worries about Coleridge’s health and safety. Passages most directly connected

               <head>1. Dorothy Wordsworth to Lady Beaumont, 7 November 1805</head>
               <salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="indent3">
                     <span change="green">Being at Patterdale on a rainy day I am at perfect leisure &amp; I think I cannot do better than transcribe for you a poem which my Brother wrote 
            the <hi rend="strike">other</hi> day before yesterday. We left home yesterday morning. I rode upon my little pony and William walked by my side. 
            We came over Kirkstone and had a very pleasant journey though the day was misty; &amp; at the top of Kirkstone we could not see fifty yards around us. 
            We were very anxious to visit some of the Vales tributary to Ulswater where we have never been before, while yet the brown leaves are upon some of 
            the trees; but I am afraid it must not be this year, for the weather seems broken. We are in the house of a Friend, a comfortable Cottage 
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">Side, the Patterdale home of Charles and Letitia Luff. DW writes this letter from the Luffs’ house on the second 
                day of her journey.
                </note>
            most happily situated in the main Vale above the Lake of Ulswater. From this room I look over the level bed of the valley,
            intersected with hedgerows, (it seems as level as a bowling-green) horses &amp; cows are feeding in the fields which are of a soft yellow hue, through
            which you hardly perceive the tinge of the fading green, a colour that harmonizes exquisitely with that of the trees upon the mountain opposite, where
            a thick cloud is resting; and through that veil, rocks and craggy points now appear.—and then are hidden again. My dear Lady Beaumont, this is a 
            wonderful country; the more wonderful, the more we know of it, much as the Tourists stare at our great rocks while they wheel along the turnpike roads.
            Yesterday we had visions of things, imperfectly seen as we passed along, that might have employed our fancy happily for hours, if they had not in the next moment 
            been replaced by others as beautiful. This Dale has not yet been intruded upon by any of the Fancy-builders, —there is only one offensive object, the 
            house of Mr Mounsey, the King of Patterdale, 
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">John Mounsey (1761–1820), who lived at Patterdale Hall. His “King of 
                Patterdale” title was passed down by local courtesy from an ancestor said to have defeated a party of Border raiders. DW may use the title somewhat 
                ironically on the model of “King Pocky,” the nickname given to Joseph Pocklington (1736–1817), who, among his other eccentricities, purchased the 
                island in Derwentwater and built a folly house there. Later in this letter, when DW speaks of a gentleman purchasing the island in Grasmere and 
                likely building a pavilion or obelisk on it, she has actual exploits of “King Pocky” in mind.
                </note>&amp; that is chiefly ugly from the colour which
            has been so cried out against that he intends to change it next summer.</span> But poor Grasmere is a devoted place! You may remember that I spoke of the 
            white-washing of the church, &amp; six years ago a trim Box was erected on <del rend="strike">the</del> a hill-side; <del rend="strike">which</del>
            it is surrounded with fir and Larch plantations, that look like a blotch or scar on the fair surface of the mountain. Luckily these deformities are 
            not visible in the grand view of the Vale, but alas poor Grasmere! The first object which now presents itself after you have clomb the hill from 
            Rydale is Mr Crump’s newly-erected large mansion,
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">Allan Bank, which, ironically, the Wordsworths would end up renting
                from John Crump between 1808 and 1811. Although William called it “a temple of abomination” and Dorothy a “monster of a house,” 
                it commanded excellent views of the Grasmere Vale and more space for a growing family and frequent houseguests.
                </note> staring over the church Steeple, 
            its foundation under the crags being much above the top of the Steeple—then a farm-house opposite to ours, on the other side of the Lake, has been taken
            by a dashing man from Manchester
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">Samuel Barber, a bachelor who had moved into and begun renovating William Gell’s cottage.</note>
            who, no doubt, will make a <hi rend="underline">fine place</hi> of it, and as he has taken the Island, too, will probably erect a pavilion 
            <del rend="strike">there</del> upon it, or, it may be, an Obelisk. This is not all. A very beautiful little Estate has been purchased in 
            the more retired part of the Vale, and the first thing the Gentleman has done preparatory to building his house, has been to make a 
            <hi rend="underline">sunk Fence</hi>
                     <note place="foot" resp="editors">Apparently DW is describing a “ha-ha,” a landscape feature that became fashionable
            in the late eighteenth century. Its usual intent was to prevent sheep from grazing on the lawns and gardens near a house without obstructing views.
                </note>
            which you overlook on every side from the rocks, thickets, and green sloping hills! Add to all that Sir Michael Fleming
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Michael Fleming (or le Fleming; 1748–1806), 4th Baronet, of Rydal Hall. The Wordsworths would later rent 
                    Rydal Mount from his widow, Lady Diana (Howard) le Fleming, with whom they had years of tense relations.
                </note> 
            has been getting his woods appraised, and 
            after Christmas the Ax is to be lifted against them, &amp; not one tree left, so the whole eastern side of the Lake will be entirely naked, even to 
            the very edge of the water!—but what could we expect better from Sir Michael? who has been building a long high wall under the grand woods behind his
            house which cuts the hill in two by a straight line; and to make his doings visible to all men he has whitewashed it as white as snow. One who could 
            do this wants a sense which others have. To him there is no “<hi rend="underline">Spirit in the wood</hi>.”
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">DW here recalls the closing line of WW’s “Nutting,” first published in the 
                    second edition of <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> (1800).

                I must add to my lamentations for the fate of Grasmere one consolation for you; that our regrets 
                at parting with it will be more than half spent before we go; &amp; that, in fact, we begin already to think that there may be many places which 
                we should now prefer.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">Aware of the Wordsworths’ fondness for their home at Town End, Grasmere, readers may be surprised by 
                    this statement of DW’s. However, by 1805 it was obvious that Dove Cottage was too small for the family. Moreover, the Wordsworths hoped to 
                    own (not merely rent) a home. In the end, the Wordsworths spent the winter of 1806–1807 as guests of the Beaumonts at Coleorton, and in 
                    1808 they moved to Allan Bank (see n4). Removals to the Rectory in Grasmere (1811) and finally to Rydal Mount (1813) would follow. In 
                    this letter, DW comforts herself at the necessity of moving by lamenting that Grasmere is not what it used to be.

                <note place="foot" resp="editors">The poem, of course, is “The
                    Solitary Reaper.” The version DW offers here is quite close to the one published in the second volume of WW’s

                please you, was suggested by a very beautiful passage in a Journal of a Tour among the Highlands, by Thomas Wilkinson,

                    Thomas Wilkinson (1751–1836), the Quaker poet, lived at Yanwath, between Penrith and Lord Lowther’s estate. In her Ullswater journal, 
                    DW describes walking with him in the Lowther woods and reports that WW asked him to help negotiate the purchase of Broad How.

                    “at least fifteen” of Michelangelo’s sonnets at the request of a friend, who was writing a biography of the artist. In speaking of 
                    “so much thought” in the poems, DW echoes something WW wrote to Sir George Beaumont in late October: “So much meaning has been put 
                    by Michael Angelo into so little room, and that meaning sometimes so excellent in itself that I found the difficulty of translating

                brings as many letters as all the rest of the week put together. I do not know why I have troubled you with this my lamentation at this time 
                except that in future it may serve to explain to you if there should be any extraordinary delay when you may have written what may demand an 
                immediate answer. My Brother and Sister are at Park House. She left me last Monday and William yesterday morning, &amp; I do not expect them 
                home before the end of next week: perhaps my Sister may stay longer, as she is still not in <hi rend="underline">strong</hi> health, &amp; we

                impels me to write to you; for while I write I seem to draw nearer to you &amp; to bring you more near to me.

                  <hi rend="indent3">I have many dear and cheerful thoughts, and many melancholy ones in my solitude—these I sometimes seek, but at others they master me &amp; 
                I turn my cowardly heart to some other employment. I read, I copy some of my Brother’s Poems (a work which he has left me to do) or 
                I write a letter. The Children are now in bed. The evening is very still, and there are no indoor sounds but the ticking of our Family watch 
                which hangs over the chimney-piece under the drawing of the Applethwaite Cottage,
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">In 1803, Sir George Beaumont
                    had given the Wordsworths a plot of land at Applethwaite, near Keswick, so that they might live closer to STC. Sir George had also sent a 
                    drawing of “the Cottage, its dashing waters, and the corner of old Skiddaw” (DW to Lady Beaumont, <title level="m">Letters</title>,
                    1:483). This picture, a symbol of home, friendship, and friends’ belief in WW’s poetic calling, hung in Dove Cottage for the whole time the 
                    Wordsworths lived there. It now resides at the Wordsworth Trust (reference GRMDC.B31).

                Flame in my fire. No one who has not been an Inmate with Children in a <hi rend="underline">Cottage</hi> can have a notion of the quietness that 
                takes possession of it when they are gone to sleep. The hour before is generally a noisy one, often given up to boisterous efforts to amuse them,
                &amp; the noise is heard in every corner of the house—then comes the washing and undressing, a work of misery, &amp; in ten minutes after,
                all is stillness and perfect rest. It is at all times a sweet hour to us; but I can fancy that I have never enjoyed it so much as now that I am
                quite alone—yet it is a strange kind of pleasure for the Image of our departed Brother
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">John Wordsworth, 
                    DW’s younger brother, had perished in February off England’s southern coast. He was captain of the <emph>Earl of Abergavenny</emph>, an East
                    Indiaman that was wrecked in Weymouth Bay. Though 155 people survived, Captain Wordsworth went down with the ship, along with much of his crew.
                </note> 
                haunts me with many a pang in the midst of happy recollections of him, &amp; glorious hopes—he loved this fireside—he paced over this floor in 
                pride before we had been six weeks in the house, exulting within his noble heart that his Father’s Children had once again a home together. We 
                did not know on what day he would come, though we were expecting him every hour, therefore he had no reason to fear that he should surprize
                us suddenly; yet twice did he approach the door &amp; lay his hand upon the latch, &amp; stop, and turn away without the courage to enter (we 
                had not met for several years) he then went to the Inn and sent us word that he was come. This will give you a notion of the depth of his 
                affections and the delicacy of his feelings. While he stayed with us he busied himself continually with little schemes for our comfort. At 
                this moment, when I cast my eyes about I scarcely see any thing that does not remind me of some circumstance of this kind, &amp; my tears 
                <hi rend="underline">will</hi> flow by fits in spite of my inner and habitual sense of the many consolations which he has let for us (chiefly in 
                his innocent life &amp; noble death) and that all our regrets are selfish. <hi rend="underline">His</hi> hope and mine, our Brother William, is 
                yet spared to me, —&amp; I have many blessings which poor John did not share; he knew &amp; affectionately loved my Sister but he never saw her 
                after her marriage, &amp; he had only heard the names of their dear Children...

                seeking consolation, and I find I am further from it for then came a bitter pang. I was weak enough to grieve for <hi rend="underline">

                upon it, for I <hi rend="underline">know</hi> that his earnest desire to return is the cause of his silence—he has nothing decisive to 
                communicate &amp; therefore has not heart to write. Heaven preserve him from Captivity in France!
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">STC traveled to Malta in April 1804, hoping to escape his failing marriage, overcome his addiction to opiates, 
                and restore his physical and mental health. As DW suggests, the ongoing war with Napoleonic France, compounded by STC’s own delays 
                (including wanderings around Italy), made his long absence a trial to both family and friends. When he finally returned to England in 1806, 
                DW was shocked at his condition.

                     <span change="green">The very morning after I wrote to you the tidings of Lord Nelson’s Fate reached us at Patterdale. We were at Breakfast when Mr. Luff’s
                Maid-servant opened the door and, shewing only her head, with an uncouth stare and a grin of pleasure told us that there had been a great victory,
                and Lord Nelson was shot. It was a blow. —<hi rend="underline">I</hi> was not collected enough to doubt, and burst into tears; but William 
                would not believe it all at once &amp; forced me to suspend my grief till he had made further inquiries. At the Inn we were told that there were
                “great rejoicings at Penrith—all the Bells ringing” — “Then, I exclaimed, he cannot be dead!” but we soon heard enough to
                leave us without a doubt, &amp; bitterly did we lament for him and our Country. Your account of what you have heard of him interests me very much.
                I believe that every truly <hi rend="underline">brave</hi> Man, in the highest sense of the word, is, as you describe Lord Nelson to have been, 
                tender and humane in all the daily acts of life.</span>

                shall then in right earnest enjoy winter quiet &amp; loneliness; besides starlight walks and winter winds are his delight—his mind, I think is often more
                fertile in this season than any other. I am now engaged in making a fair and final transcript of the Poem on his own Life. I mean 
                <hi rend="underline">final</hi>, till it is prepared for the press, which will not be for many years. No doubt before that time he will, either from the 
                suggestions of his Friends or his own, or both, have some alterations to make, but it appears to us at present to be finished.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">DW here shows considerable insight into her brother’s psychology and habits of work. WW would, of course, revise the poem
                    further, and it would not see print until after his death in 1850. Nonetheless, this letter of DW’s is one authority for considering the 1805 
                    <title level="m">Prelude</title> as a complete version of the work, widely considered her brother’s masterpiece.

               He prizes Sir George’s letters most highly; but I can assure you, he never suffers himself to expect them, &amp; would be very much hurt were
               he to attempt to write to him when it was an effort. You do not tell me whither you are going from Aston, probably to Dunmow

               such a description of Sir George’s venerable Mother whom he had the happiness of seeing at Dunmow as inspired me with reverence &amp; admiration. Pray tell 
               me if she continues to enjoy the same excellent health &amp; cheerful spirits. Have you heard from your Sister again? I cannot express how much pleasure it
               gives me when you speak of her. <span change="green">I had almost forgotten to tell you that we were at Lowther three days after I wrote from Patterdale. We walked
               through the woods, &amp; along the Forest path which my Brother described to you—but it was not the time to see its beauties for there were no daisies or
               other flowers, &amp; the very line of the path was invisible, the whole ground being covered with leaves. Thomas Wilkinson (The Quaker), who was our Guide
               mentioned to us that he had seen a Gentleman just come from Coleorton, who had been among the woods for many hours in search of the path but could not find it.
               We wished we could have seen him, &amp; my Brother sent a message to him to request that if he came into our neighborhood, he would have the goodness to
               call upon him. We spent a delightful day at Lowther, indeed the whole week was delightful—we ranged from one beautiful scene to another. I came home in perfect
               health, &amp; we boasted of my wonderful strength</span>; but last week I was confined to my bed four days by a violent pain in my left side. I was bled, blistered 
               &amp;c, and am now perfectly well, and the Apothecary tells me I have no reason to apprehend a return of the disease in consequence of having once had it. It being a

                  <p>On 19 March 1808, a local married couple, George and Sarah Green, died attempting to
                cross Langdale Fell on their way home during a storm. They lived at the far end of
                Easedale, about two miles northwest of the Wordsworths, who were living in Dove
                Cottage, Town End, Grasmere, at the time and had employed one of the Greens’
                daughters, Sally, as a maid. The Greens’ deaths orphaned eight children under 
                the age of 16 and six under age 11, as well as six grown children by previous
                marriages.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">The eight young children of George and Sarah Green were Mary (b. 1793, age 15); Sarah, called
                     Sally (b. 1795, age 12); Jane (b. 1796, age 11); George (b. 1798, age 10); John (b. 1800, age 7); William (b. 1804, age 4); 
                     Thomas (b. 1805, age 3); and an infant “at the breast,” Hannah (b. 1807, age 1). George Green had a son and three
                     daughters by a prior marriage: Margaret (b. 1766); Betty (b. 1771); Agnes, or Aggy (b. 1775, d. 1842); and James (b. 1777, d.
                     1851). Sarah Green had had a son and a daughter before her marriage; both were in service in Langdale in 1808. Dates from

                George Green was 65, and Sarah, considerably younger at 43, had recently given birth
                to a baby girl.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Sarah’s age is never given by DW, but we draw information from the Greens’ gravestone,
                    which interestingly has George’s age at death as 66 rather than 65. [Illustration: the grave in St. Oswald’s churchyard, Grasmere.]</note>

                The loss of the parents threw “the whole vale,” in Dorothy 
                Wordsworth’s words, into “the greatest consternation.”

            </head>
                  <p>Nine days after the tragedy, Dorothy reported to her friend Catherine Clarkson that
               the Wordsworths had immediately been “employed in laying schemes to prevent the
               children from falling into the hands of persons who may use them unkindly.”
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:206, DW to Catherine Clarkson, 28 March 1808. DW also criticizes
                    the practice of orphans being boarded in the <title level="a">Narrative concerning George &amp; Sarah Green</title> (hereafter 
                    <title level="a">Narrative</title>) itself, describing how they were often given “to the lowest Bidder, that is, to board them 
                    out with Persons who will take them at the cheapest rate; and such as are the least able to provide for them properly are often the 
                    readiest Bidders, for the sake of having a little money coming in.” At 10 years of age, children were made parish apprentices,
                    “at best a slavish condition.” DW also explains how Sarah Green herself had “been a Parish Apprentice and therefore,
                    probably, a neglected Child.”</note>
                The specific fear was that the young Greens would suffer the usual fate of orphans, 
                being boarded out by the parish to foster families paid a mere two shillings per week
                per child. Accordingly, the Wordsworths began to solicit donations, and a brief 
                account of the events was written by William and circulated to those who might be 
                willing to contribute (see appendix A).
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">WW wrote letters asking for donations, enclosing the short description of the events, in extant 1808
                    letters to Richard Sharp (<title level="m">Letters</title> 2:210, 13 April) and Francis Wrangham (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:
                    211–12, 17 April). He and DW wrote letters acknowledging the receipt of funds to Lady Beaumont (<title level="m">Letters</title>,
                    2:224, 20 April), Richard Sharp (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:229–30, 25 April), Jane Marshall (<title level="m">Letters</title>,
                    2:234, 11 May), Lady Holland (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:253, 20 June), Walter Scott (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:263, 4
                    August), Samuel Rogers (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:267, 29 September), and again Francis Wrangham (<title level="m">Letters</title>,
                    2:269, 2 October).</note>
                It seems that the Wordsworths were tireless in their efforts, as William, in a letter
                to Francis Wrangham dated 17 April 1808, apologizes for the “dim transcript made
                by a multiplying writer, we having had occasion to make so many copies.”

                  <p>A letter from William to Coleridge written precisely one month after the tragedy, on
                19 April 1808, included a copy of a short poem he had written entitled 
                <title level="a">Elegiac Stanzas composed in the Churchyard of Grasmere, Westmorland,
                a few days after the Internment there of a Man and his Wife, Inhabitants of the Vale,
                who were lost upon the neighbouring Mountains, on the night of the nineteenth of March
                last</title> (see appendix B).

                William urged Coleridge, who was then in London delivering a series of lectures, to 
                “turn these verses to any profit for the poor Orphans in any way, either by 
                reciting, circulating in manuscript or publishing them.” William also explained,
                “As soon as she has leisure Dorothy means to draw up a minute detail of all that
                she knows concerning the lives and characters of the Husband and Wife, and everything
                relating to their melancholy end, and its effect upon the Inhabitants of this Vale; a
                story that will be rich both in pleasure and profit.” Dorothy, in fact, had begun
                drafting her own record at roughly this same time, as evidenced by her noting near the
                beginning of her account, “It was a month yesterday since the sad event happened.”

                The end of the <title level="a">Narrative</title> is signed and dated 4 May 1808, suggesting that
                Dorothy completed it over a period of two weeks.</p>
                  <p>The success of the Wordsworths’ efforts in circulating requests for funds is
                immediately apparent upon perusal of the subscription book they kept to record
                donations pledged and received. By the middle of May 1808—just two months after the
                tragedy—more than £300 had been raised, and by September 1808 almost 300 donors had
                pledged nearly £500. Individual pledges varied, as we would expect, largely
                according to the means of the donor, ranging from the 10 guineas given by both the
                Bishop of Llandaff and Lord Muncaster to offerings of mere sixpences by local
                laboring people and servants, many of whom could probably ill afford even these
                small sums.</p>
                  <p>Somewhat surprisingly, so far as the records show, the Wordsworths made no direct
                monetary contribution themselves. This was probably owing to their own straitened
                financial circumstances in 1808 or rationalized in terms of their deciding to retain
                Sally Green after the tragedy instead of letting her go, which had been their plan.
                The Wordsworths’ belief that the charity bestowed upon the Greens had, in some way,
                to be circumscribed is readily apparent in their decision to cap at £500 the funds
                raised for the orphans in order not to raise the children above (or at least
                significantly above) their prior station.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Levy, <title level="a">The Wordsworths, the Greens,</title> 542.</note>
                This led to significant friction with Coleridge, who questioned both the belief that
                the subscription should be capped and the Wordsworths’ decision to sell the entire
                contents of the Greens’ cottage. Other hints of worry over possible unintended
                consequences of assisting the family occur in the <title level="a">Narrative.</title>
                Dorothy, for instance, notes the initial concerns of some genteel women who housed the
                children before their placement in new homes. Fears had been expressed that
                “wayward desires” in the children might be raised “by the luxuries
                among which they had lived for the last three weeks.” While Dorothy expresses 
                her relief (and that of the other women) “that [their] fears that this might 
                happen were ill-grounded,” the articulation of this worry is in itself revealing.</p>
                  <p>The Wordsworths were far from unassisted in supervising the collection of funds and
                the placement and upbringing of the Green children. The rector of Grasmere, the
                Reverend Thomas Jackson, agreed to act as trustee, and George Mackereth, the parish
                clerk, was appointed official collector. Six local women—Mrs. Watson (the wife of
                the Bishop of Llandaff), Mrs. Lloyd (wife of author Charles Lloyd), Mrs. King and
                Mrs. North (both recent settlers in the neighborhood), a Miss Knot, and William’s
                wife, Mary—were appointed to superintend the collection of subscriptions, administer
                the funds collected, and oversee the care of the children in their new homes. For
                the next 21 years, until the youngest Green children were able to support
                themselves, the trustees distributed the funds to the families who had taken in the
                younger orphaned children, deservedly earning Ernest de Sélincourt’s praise as
                “a model of a simple act of charity wisely conceived and scrupulously 
                administered.”
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">De Selincourt, <title level="m">A Narrative Concerning George and Sarah Green</title>, 11.</note>
                Surviving collections receipts in the Wordsworth Trust archives from the woman-led
                effort to finance the children’s schooling, medical care, and clothing allow
                historians to piece together a vivid portrait of the care of these children. 
                Dorothy’s <title level="a">Narrative</title> in particular demonstrates how
                the work of charity and caregiving was largely a female endeavor.</p>
                  <p>For the most part, these women worked harmoniously in the service of the children.
                Susan Levin has described Dorothy’s story as “an affirmation of a certain
                mode of social assistance” and a “positive description of a community in 
                which experience and relation of that experience almost conflate.”

                For Susan Wolfson, Dorothy’s general “social sensibility” throughout
                her prose and poetic works, including the <title level="a">Narrative,</title> 
                differentiates her writing from William’s “more solitary poetics.”
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors">Wolfson, <title level="a">Dorothy Wordsworth in Conversation with William,</title> 154.</note>
                Nevertheless, in the <title level="a">Narrative,</title> Dorothy cannot help criticizing
                one Mrs North, who “<del rend="strike">cannot do a charitable action without the 
                pleasure of being busy</del>.” As this strikethrough suggests, Dorothy censors 
                herself, deleting her bitter complaints and canceling her antagonist’s name. Elsewhere
                in the manuscript she writes, “I will not blemish a narrative of events so moving,
                which have brought forward so many kind and good feelings, by entering into the cabals 
                and heart-burnings of M<hi rend="sup">
                        <hi rend="underline">rs</hi>
                     </hi>
                     <del rend="strike">North.</del>” Throughout DCMS 64, Mrs. North’s name 
                is completely erased, revealing that Dorothy was sufficiently concerned about the
                circulation of the <title level="a">Narrative</title> to accentuate discretion as well as an impression of
                local solidarity.</p>

                  <p>The <title level="a">Narrative</title> is a remarkable work of local history, one that 
                utilizes Dorothy’s talents as a precise and compassionate recorder of speech and
                events. Both a keen observer of and a participant in this crisis, she brings the 
                perspectives of both an outsider and an insider: an outsider in that the Greens, as 
                poor farmers, belonged to a different class and moved in different social circles; and
                an insider in that, as an inhabitant of Grasmere Vale, she possessed a deep understanding
                of the Greens’ way of life and had a firsthand perspective on the aftermath of the
                parents’ untimely deaths.</p>

                  <p>Dorothy’s insider status is apparent in her direct addresses to her confidential
                readers, namely those members of her social circle she expected would read her account
                in manuscript. The full title of the <title level="a">Narrative</title> includes

                and its opening line—“You remember a single Cottage at the foot of Blentern
                Gill”—is one of many nods to a knowing audience familiar with Grasmere and
                its environs (see fig. 4.1). While implicitly directed toward a broader, if still localized,
                readership, the more specific addressee of the <title level="a">Narrative</title> appears
                to have been Dorothy’s good friend Catherine Clarkson. The Clarksons urged Dorothy
                to publish the <title level="a">Narrative,</title> and a complete manuscript copy of the
                text remains in the Clarkson papers at the British Library.
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors">The manuscript copy (DCMS 64) used for our text and all quotations is held by the Wordsworth Trust (see <ref target="#Textual">Textual Note</ref>).</note>                                                                
                Throughout the <title level="a">Narrative,</title> Dorothy draws her anticipated readers
                into the story, inviting them directly to feel compassion for the Greens (“You will
                wonder how they lived at all and indeed I can scarcely tell you”), to participate in
                the unfolding of events (“It would not be easy to give you an idea of the suspense 
                and trouble in every face before the bodies were found”), and to identify with the 
                charitable actions of those who came to the aid of the orphans (“You will not wonder,
                after what I have said, that we have been anxious to preserve these Orphans”). In 
                this way, Dorothy assumes sympathetic readers, though at moments she acknowledges a gap 
                between her own feelings and those of readers like the Clarksons who lived outside the 
                Grasmere community: “I cannot give <hi rend="underline">you</hi> the same feelings
                that <hi rend="underline">I</hi> have of them as neighbours and fellow-inhabitants of this
                Vale; therefore what is in my mind a full and living picture will be to you but a feeble
                sketch.”</p>
                  <p>Dorothy’s <title level="a">Narrative</title> also assumes a readership familiar with and
                concerned about the fate of small landowners like the Greens who, despite their tireless labor,
                could barely subsist on their land. She describes the Greens as being
                
            <quote>the poorest People in the Vale, though they had a small estate of their own, and a
                Cow. This morsel of Land, now deeply mortgaged had been in the possession of the
                Family for generations, and they were loth to part with it: consequently, they had
                never had any assistance from the Parish.</quote>
                
                Dorothy offers many examples of their extreme poverty—how George Green, age 65,
                had to do odd jobs for neighbors and dig peat from his own land; how the children were
                hired out to work for local families; how, after their parents’ deaths, the orphans
                were found with no money, little food, and apparently on the edge of starvation:
                
            <quote>They must very soon have parted with their Land if they had lived; for their means
                were reduced by little and little till scarcely anything <hi rend="underline">but</hi>
                the <hi rend="underline">Land</hi> was left. The Cow was grown old; and they had not 
                money to buy another; they had sold their horse; and were in the habit of carrying any
                trifles <del rend="strike">that</del> they could spare out of house or stable to barter
                for potatoes or meal. Luxuries they had none—they never made tea, and when the 
                Neighbours went to look after the Children they found nothing in the house but two 
                boiling potatoes, a very little meal, a little bread, and three or four legs of lean 
                dried mutton.</quote>
                  </p>
                  <p>In such descriptions, Dorothy revisits an archetype that had figured in her journals
                and her brother’s poetry—<title level="a">Michael: A Pastoral Poem</title>
                being the best example of the story of a small landowner (or statesman, as they were 
                called) at risk of losing his land. Michael is forced to make a heartbreaking decision
                between selling his land and sending his son, Luke, to work in the city. Ultimately 
                choosing the latter proves both a terrible and futile decision, terrible because Luke
                becomes dissipated and never returns home, and futile because after his parents’
                deaths “the estate / Was sold, and went into a stranger’s hands”;
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">WW, <title level="a">Michael,</title> lines 474–75.</note>
                thus, both Luke and the land are lost. In a journal entry for 18 May 1800, Dorothy
                records a conversation with her neighbor, John Fisher, who similarly describes the
                extinction of the class of small landowners: “He talked much about the alteration
                in the times, &amp; observed that in a short time there would be only two ranks of
                people, the very rich &amp; the very poor, for those who have small estates says he
                are forced to sell, &amp; all the land goes into one hand.”
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">

                For Dorothy and her audience, the Greens were similarly situated and equally tragic:
                they represented the passing away of a “pastoral” life (to use William’s
                subtitle), one that seemed increasingly under threat. It may be that drawing the plight
                of these families to public notice was “the work” that Thomas Clarkson had
                in mind in urging Dorothy to publish the narrative; a request that prompted her 
                well-known reply to Catherine Clarkson, on 9 December 1810, discussed in detail below.

                  </p>
                  <p>How much did the Wordsworths know about the Greens’ poverty prior to their deaths, 
               and were they willfully blind to it? In a 2003 essay, <title level="a">The Wordsworths, 
               the Greens, and the Limits of Sympathy,</title> I explored the social commentary in the
               <title level="a">Narrative,</title> in particular Dorothy’s representation of the
               Greens’ poverty and the nature and circumstances of the subscription raised for 
               the children. Two of the main claims advanced in the essay relate to Dorothy’s
               representation and treatment of the poor. Although Dorothy insists on a number of 
               occasions that she and her family were unaware of the Greens’ extreme deprivation—
               “Alas!,” she writes at one point, “we gained our knowledge [of their
               extreme poverty] since their death”—the <title level="a">Narrative</title>
               also betrays a sense of personal and collective guilt over having, perhaps willfully, 
               ignored so many warning signs. The Wordsworths possibly felt culpable, having had one
               of the older girls, Sally Green, in their service at the time of the tragedy. They knew,
               as Dorothy notes in the text, that “one of the little Girls, our own Sally or another,
               used to come to fetch [our used tea leaves] two long miles!” Just before the tragedy,
               the Wordsworths had insisted that the Greens purchase Sally two new shifts, or smocks, to 
               fit her out for service in their house, an expense Dorothy subsequently realized must have
               caused great hardship.</p>
                  <p>In attending the shop in Ambleside to see if the cloth for these shifts had been paid for 
               after the deaths of George and Sarah Green, and finding that it had, Dorothy reports that 
               many members of the local community had considered the Greens “rather ‘too 
               <hi rend="underline">Stiff,</hi>’ unwilling to receive favours but the
                ‘<hi rend="underline">keenest Payers</hi>’, always in a hurry to pay when they 
               <hi rend="underline">had</hi> money.” These remarks suggest the impossible situation
               that families like the Greens found themselves in: paying their debts subjected them to 
               being called prideful; yet no doubt they would have been subject to worse insults if they
               had not paid. In an age when accepting charity was considered a sign of weakness, one can
               see how the Greens were in a hopeless predicament. Dorothy is therefore at pains to 
               demonstrate the Greens’ worthiness, an effort to meet the standard that had been
               set for the deserving poor (one that is also found in William’s short narrative used
               to raise funds for the orphans; see appendix A). In William’s narrative, compassion
               for the children is “more deeply felt,” and “a general desire that more
               than ordinary exertions should be made” prevails because of the parents’ 
               “frugality and industry” and “even cheerful endurance of extreme poverty.” 
               In Dorothy’s account, she seems less willing to describe the Greens’ suffering 
               as evidence of moral strength, perhaps reflecting her own conflicted views about the treatment
               of the poor generally, and about her family’s treatment of the Greens specifically. 
               Indeed, in the most significant set of deletions in the <title level="a">Narrative,</title>
               she cancels several lines that embody this understanding of the Greens as willingly suffering
               the burden of poverty:
               
               <quote>… I must say that the general feelings have been purely kind and 
               benevolent, arising from compassion for the forlorn condition of the Orphans and from a 
               respectful regard for the memory of their Parents who <del rend="strike">with unexampled chearfulness, patience
               and self-denial, had supported themselves and their Family in extreme poverty; and</del> have
               left in them a living testimony of their own virtuous conduct: <del rend="strike">for the 
               Children’s manners (I again repeat it) are of one innocent,</del> [illegible deleted word]
               <del rend="strike">and affectionate in a remarkable degree, so that each of them has already 
               made Friends of</del> [illegible deleted word]. (30)</quote>
                                   
               These cancellations may suggest her inner conflict over such conceptions of the poor.</p>
                  <p>As noted previously, Dorothy writes the <title level="a">Narrative</title> as a local historian,
               describing a village and way of life in which she is embedded and about which she can be neither
               objective nor disinterested. She documents the mourning of an entire community. Not only does
               she relate her own knowledge of the Greens prior to the tragedy as well as that of others who
               knew them, but she also describes the affecting scenes of the children’s grief upon learning
               the fate of their parents and their struggles in settling into strange new homes. Much of what
               the <title level="a">Narrative</title> includes consists of what Dorothy describes as the 
               “fireside talk in our Cottages”; it is in such domestic settings, she writes, that
               one hears “the inner histories of Families, their lesser and greater cares, their 
               peculiar habits, and ways of life [that] are recorded in the breasts of their Fellow-inhabitants
               of the Vale.” In recording this “fireside talk,” Dorothy becomes the voice of
               the community, situating herself within a fellowship that not only rallies behind the orphans
               but also implicitly questions whether the village could have done more to help the family 
               before the parents’ death. Dorothy’s <title level="a">Narrative</title> evokes the 
               shared locality in which they live: Easedale, where the Greens made their home and the Wordsworths
               frequently rambled; the nearby fells upon which the Greens met their fate; the local homes into which
               the orphans are taken, temporarily and permanently. Dorothy is also very much present throughout
               the <title level="a">Narrative</title> as a character who experiences and expresses the sympathy
               on which the story turns. In reflecting on the place where the Greens were lost, she recalls her
               own experience “at the top of Blea Crag above Easedale Tarn, that very spot where I myself
               had sate down <hi rend="sup">&lt;three&gt;</hi> six years ago, unable to see a yard before me, or
               to go a step further over the Crags.” Anyone, she suggests, might have shared the Greens’
               fate, as a mountain-walker like Dorothy had special cause to know.</p>
                  <p>Dorothy’s sympathetic connection to the Greens must also have been related to her own status as
               an orphan: Dorothy and William (and their three brothers Richard, John, and Christopher) were, like the
               Green children, bereft of their parents at young ages: their mother died in 1778 and their father in 
               1783. Dorothy and William, again like the Greens, were sent to different relatives after the deaths of
               their parents, not seeing each other for nine years. By 1808, Dorothy had been reunited with her brother
               for a decade, yet she must have keenly understood the pain felt by the Green siblings, many of
               whom were separated though most of them, happily, remained in the same vale. Only the eldest boy, George
               (age 10), was placed with a relative, a half-brother in Ambleside; the rest of the younger Green children
               joined new families. Since, as Dorothy notes, “It had been declared with one voice by the people of
               the Parish, men and women, that the Infant and her [11-year-old] Sister Jane should not be parted,”
               they were together placed with a childless couple. The two youngest boys, William (age four) and Thomas
               (age three), both still “in petticoats,” were kept together in the home of a family with grown
               children. John (age seven) was taken in by John Fleming, a sheep farmer who had been a friend of his father.
               In contrast to Dorothy’s own experience as an orphan, being sent to a distant home in Halifax, West
               Yorkshire (and later to others, some welcoming and some less so), the Green children were all kept close
               to their native vale and placed with families that seemed genuinely devoted to them. As Dorothy concluded,
               “The general feelings have been purely kind and benevolent, arising from compassion for the forlorn
               condition of the Orphans and from a respectful regard for the memory of their Parents.”</p>

                     <anchor xml:id="Circulating"/>C. Circulating the <title level="a">Narrative</title> (after Funds Had Been Raised)
           </head>
                  <p>As detailed in the <ref target="#Textual">Textual and Editorial headnote</ref>, long after funds had been raised
              in aid of the Green children, Dorothy’s <title level="a">Narrative</title> was read and copied by
              family members and friends, and from very early on, she was urged to publish it. Dorothy’s response
              to Catherine Clarkson’s encouragement came in a letter dated 9 December 1810. It is worth quoting in
              full, as her famous refusal—“I should detest the idea of setting myself up as an Author”—
              is often taken out of context and misconstrued:
                
           <quote>My dear Friend I cannot express what pain I feel in refusing to grant any request of yours, and above all one
              in which dear Mr Clarkson joins so earnestly, but indeed I cannot have that narrative published. My reasons are
              entirely disconnected with myself, much as I should detest the idea of setting myself up as an Author. I should
              not object on that score as if it had been an invention of my own it might have been published without a name,
              and nobody would have thought of me. But on account of the Family of the Greens I cannot consent. Their story
              was only represented to the world in that narrative which was drawn up for the collecting of the subscription,
              so far as might tend to produce the end desired, but by publishing this narrative of mine I should bring the
              children forward to notice as Individuals, and we know not what injurious effect this might have upon them.
              Besides it appears to me that the events are too recent to be published in delicacy to others as well as to
              the children. I should be the more hurt at having to return such an answer to your request, if I could believe
              that the story would be of that service to the work which Mr Clarkson imagines. I cannot believe that it would
              do much for it. Thirty or forty years hence when the Characters of the children are formed and they can be no
              longer objects of curiosity, if it should be thought that any service would be done, it is my present wish that
              it should then be published whether I am alive or dead.

             Dorothy’s sensitivity to the children’s privacy trumps even the request of her dear friends, the
             Clarksons, and seems driven by concern that the orphaned children might be harmed, their story sensationalized.</p>
                  <p>Over thirty years after the deaths of George and Sarah Green, in 1839, Thomas De  Quincey, a well-known author who
             had moved into Dove Cottage after the Wordsworths relocated, revisited the episode in his essay 
             <title level="m">Recollections of Grasmere,</title> which was first published as the September 1839 installment
             of his <title level="m">Tait’s Edinburgh Magazine</title> series, <title level="a">Sketches of Life and Manners; from
             the Autobiography of an English Opium Eater.</title>
                     <note place="foot" resp="editors">It was also republished in the posthumous collection of De Quincey’s essays, 
                        <title level="m">Recollections of the Lakes and the Lake Poets</title> (1862).</note>
             De Quincey recollects that, after returning from a visit to the Lakes to Oxford in 1808, he received a letter from
             Dorothy “asking for any subscriptions [he] might succeed in obtaining, amongst [his] college friends, in aid
             of the funds then raising in behalf of an orphan family, who had become such by an affecting tragedy that had occurred
             within a few weeks from [his] visit to Grasmere.”
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">De Quincey, <title level="a">Sketches of Life and Manners,</title> 1:569.</note>
             Alluding to Dorothy’s as-yet-unpublished <title level="a">Narrative,</title> he describes how 
             “Miss Wordsworth’s simple but fervid memoir not being within my reach at this moment, I
             must trust to my own recollections and my own impressions to retrace the story.”</p>
                  <p>De Quincey proceeds with a lengthy, embellished account filled with details of both the Greens’
            death on the fells and of the children’s patient suffering that are not included in Dorothy’s
            account. It is not clear how he came by these details, though he did move to Grasmere in 1809, so it is
            possible he heard them from witnesses. Nevertheless, De Quincey transforms the narrative into melodrama.
            He describes how the Greens had been strongly warned against returning home via Langdale Fell, a point
            never mentioned in Dorothy’s account, and comments: “After this they were seen no more. 
            They had disappeared into the cloud of death.” He also invents the mounting fears of the 
            soon-to-be-orphaned Green children, imagining how “Every sound, every echo amongst the hills, was
            listened to for five hours, from seven to twelve.” Further adding a gothic flair to the tale, he
            writes, “Some time in the course of the evening—but it was late, and after midnight—the
            moon arose, and shed a torrent of light upon the Langdale fells, which had already, long before, witnessed
            in darkness the death of their parents.”</p>
                  <p>Dorothy, in contrast, describes the children patiently waiting, reasonably assuming their parents had stayed
             overnight in Langdale due to the weather. Whereas Dorothy’s account evidences a deep communal and human
             connection to the Greens, De Quincey’s treats this family catastrophe as an occasion for overwrought
             storytelling. At one point, in fact, he confesses to having entertained a party of American visitors “by
             conducting them through Grasmere into the little inner chamber of Easedale, and there, within sight of the
             solitary cottage, Blentarn Ghyll, telling them the story of the Greens.”
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">De Quincey, <title level="a">Sketches of Life and Manners,</title> 2:38.</note>
             In other words, albeit decades later, her once-intimate friend De Quincey exploited the Greens’ fate
             much in the way Dorothy feared.</p>
                  <p>Dorothy’s account thus remains the most reliable account of this Lakeland tragedy, providing extensive
            details about the lives of the Green family before the death of the parents, the events surrounding their
            deaths, and the community’s response. In addition to being the most informative, it is the least
            romanticized of the records, and also the most poignant.</p>

                  <p>The diplomatic transcription of the <title level="a">Narrative</title> that follows is taken from DCMS
               64, a blue, clothbound notebook in the collections of the Wordsworth Trust. Written on the cover of
               the notebook, in Dorothy’s hand, is the short title <title level="a">Narrative. The Greens 
               1808.</title> (see fig. 4.2). The notebook begins with a prefatory note by William, dated 11 May
               1808, explaining that the narrative was “drawn up” by Dorothy at his request (fig. 4.2).
               William adds that he “entreated that she would give a <hi rend="underline">minute detail</hi>
               of all the particulars which had come within her notice,” as a full report would better
               answer “the end for which the account was written . . . viz. that of leaving behind a record
               of human sympathies, and moral sentiments, either as they were called forth or brought to remembrance”
               by the tragic deaths of George and Sarah Green in March. On the first page of the <title level="a">Narrative,</title>
               Dorothy provides the full title as <title level="a">A Narrative concerning George &amp; Sarah Green of
               the Parish of Grasmere addressed to a Friend.</title> The notebook contains thirty leaves, and the page
               size varies slightly, averaging approximately 240mm x 190mm (h x w). The notebook appears to have been
               made by a stationer, as the paper board cover is original (fig. 4.2).</p>

                  </figure>
                  <p>Dorothy’s <title level="a">Narrative</title> fills the entire rest of the notebook now catalogued
               as DCMS 64. She paginated it from page 2 to the end of the <title level="a">Narrative</title> on page 43.
               After a few blank leaves following the end of the main text, she added four pages of notes. As may be
               seen in figure 4.1, a representative page, the copy is largely fair, suggesting that she was probably
               working from a previous draft, but there are considerable revisions throughout. In our digital edition,
               the text is presented as a diplomatic transcription that respects as much as possible the text and
               layout of the original (including line, paragraph, and page breaks).</p>
                  <p>Dorothy’s handwritten revisions within DCMS 64 may be divided into three main categories:</p>
                  <list rend="numbered">
                     <item>Those she seemingly made while drafting the original or shortly
                        thereafter. All of these changes are minor and reflect immediate
                        second thoughts.</item>
                     <item>Those made in ink at a somewhat later date. Chiefly, these are
                        cancellations of lines or passages like the aforementioned complaints about
                        Mrs. North. She also cancels William and Mary’s names in one place,
                        substituting “my brother and sister.” In another, she replaces
                        “William” with “my brother.” Further, she softens
                        some descriptions of the Greens that might have been perceived as negative.
                        These revisions and cancels are often made with a noticeably darker ink.</item>
                     <item>Those made in pencil, possibly later still. For the most part, these
                        revisions are insubstantial, making minor corrections or simply recopying
                        the same words (a practice seen in Dorothy’s other manuscripts). She does,
                        however, add one substantial note in pencil, the final one, which recounts
                        the tragic death of the villager Mary Watson (see note to page 38).</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>In total, there are five known manuscripts of the <title level="a">Narrative.</title>
                    Three are autograph copies, two of which are complete (DCMS 64 and British Library
                    Add MS 41267) and one incomplete (DCMS 51). The remaining two (DCMS 167 and WLMSH/2/5)
                    are transcriptions made by other hands, as described in the following
                    paragraphs. All copies except the British Library autograph are held by the
                    Wordsworth Trust. We have selected DCMS 64 as our copy-text because it is
                    Dorothy’s personal copy, the one to which she returned to reread and make
                    revisions. The handwriting is fair, with most of the revisions and cancels
                    having been added later, as can be determined by the differences in ink and by
                    the nature of the revisions, most of which appear to have been made to mask the
                    identity of some of the individuals involved, for reasons of tact or clarity.
                    (Such changes were typical of Dorothy, especially when she contemplated
                    publishing her manuscript materials or sharing them with new audiences.) Dorothy
                    also added notes to the end of the <title level="a">Narrative</title> that relate
                    to events that took place many years after 1808. If there had been a preceding
                    draft, it has not survived.</p>
                  <p>The British Library (BL) copy (Add MS 41267), part of the Clarkson Papers
                    collection, is almost entirely fair, written in a neat hand with very few
                    revisions. Like DCMS 64, it is dated 4 May 1808, but it seems unlikely that
                    Dorothy completed this copy on the same day as she did DCMS 64, meaning she
                    likely just reproduced the date from DCMS 64. As the BL catalogue entry notes,
                    Catherine Clarkson is probably the “friend” mentioned in the title
                    and the original dedicatee of the narrative. At the end of a letter dated 9 
                    February 1812, Clarkson writes to Dorothy, “Don’t forget your promise of
                    giving me a copy of your Narrative in your own hand-writing.”
                            <note place="foot" resp="editors">Catherine Clarkson to DW, 9 February 1812, cataloged as 
                                f.36 in the Clarkson Papers, Add MS41267 A: 1787–1853, British Library.</note>
                    Clarkson had certainly read a copy of the <title level="a">Narrative</title>
                    earlier, as is evidenced by her letter of 9 December 1810 urging Dorothy to
                    publish it, but perhaps she never had her own copy prior to 1812. The paper in
                    the BL manuscript of the <title level="a">Narrative</title> is watermarked 1808;
                    however, this tells us only that the text was copied sometime after 1808—Dorothy
                    might have had the paper for some time. So, it seems likely that the BL
                    <title level="m">Narrative</title> was made after Clarkson’s
                    1812 request, on paper from 1808, or that Dorothy simply sent Clarkson a copy
                    she had made earlier. Some, but not all, of the revisions to DCMS 64 are
                    duplicated in the BL manuscript, suggesting either that some revisions to the
                    notebook were added after the BL copy had been made or that Dorothy did not wish
                    to retain some of the revisions in the copy.</p>
                  <p>The only surviving autograph version of the <title level="a">Narrative</title>
                    besides DCMS 64 and the BL copy is an excerpt in DCMS 51, a miscellany in which
                    Dorothy copied various poems and narratives. After including William’s 
                    inscription and four pages of the <title level="a">Narrative,</title> it ends
                    mid-sentence in a paragraph found in the middle of page 5 of DCMS 64. Like the
                    BL copy, the DCMS 51 version appears to have postdated DCMS 64. It includes only
                    one small correction, made on the first page in the course of copying. It does
                    not include any of what appear to be the later revisions to DCMS 64.</p>
                  <p>Our edition notes any textual discrepancies between the two complete surviving
                    autograph versions (DCMS 64 and the BL/Clarkson copy). Assuming that DCMS 64 was
                    Dorothy’s copytext for the BL version, she made minor revisions in the process
                    of transcribing.</p>
                  <p>One of the two complete contemporaneous copies of the <title level="a">Narrative</title>
                    in other hands, DCMS 167, was, according to a note at its end, “transcribed by
                    Miss Fletcher now Lady Richardson.” Mary, Lady Richardson (1802–1880) lived
                    in Easedale for several years. Her mother, Mrs. Mary Fletcher (1770–1858) had
                    visited the Lakes on several occasions and in 1839, with the help of William Wordsworth,
                    had purchased, with her husband, Lancrigg Farm in Easedale. Her youngest daughter, Mary,
                    who transcribed the <title level="a">Narrative,</title> lived at the farm with her
                    parents until her marriage in 1847. It is likely that her interest in the Greens’
                    story came about because the family’s residence was near the cottage where the
                    Greens had lived (and which remains there today). As the Fletchers did not move to
                    Easedale until 1839, the <title level="a">Narrative</title> was likely not copied until
                    some time later, suggesting ongoing interest in the story. The other copy, WLMSH/2/5,
                    was transcribed by Mary Wordsworth’s sister Sara Hutchinson. The year in which this
                    transcript was made is not known.</p>
                  <p>The number of extant copies demonstrates the significance the <title level="a">Narrative</title>
                    held for the Wordsworths and their social circle, as a document meant to record an important
                    incident in the life of the village but also to travel widely. In 1839, De Quincey reports
                    his understanding that the <title level="a">Narrative</title> “went into the hands
                    of the royal family; at any rate, the august ladies of that house (all or some of them)
                    were amongst the many subscribers to the orphan children.”
                            <note place="foot" resp="editors">De Quincey, <title level="a">Sketches of Life and Manners,</title> 1:569.</note>
                    The highest number of complete manuscript copies of a work by Dorothy that survives is five,
                    for the <title level="m">Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland, A.D, 1803</title>.
                    However, the <title level="a">Narrative</title> is a close second with four complete
                    manuscripts and one partial copy. In contrast, Dorothy’s <title level="m">Journal
                    of a Tour of the Continent, 1820</title> survives in only a single copy, as is the case
                    with her Grasmere journal notebooks, which were evidently not meant to be shared outside
                    of the household.</p>
                  <p>A November 1850 letter from Mary Wordsworth to her sister-in-law Mary Monkhouse
                    Hutchinson establishes that the <title level="a">Narrative</title> was still being
                    circulated and copied four decades after its composition. Midway through this letter,
                    the then-80-year-old Mary Wordsworth asks whether Monkhouse’s daughters, Elizabeth
                    and Sarah, had “ever beg[u]n to copy the Green’s Narrative and if so what they
                    did with it.” Apparently, Fanny Wordsworth, wife of William Jr., had recently
                    reported, “Eliz. was about it when she was at Carlisle, and Sarah talked of
                    doing it at the Cooksons.” Since, as Mary Wordsworth explains, the Green “family
                    have applied again for it,” her recently deceased husband’s long-time clerk,
                    John Carter, “is ready to make them a Copy, if he hears one is not in forwardness.”
                            <note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <title level="m">LMW</title>, 326.</note>
                    The copy eventually sent to the Greens, the present whereabouts of which are unknown,
                    was passed down from John Green—a seven-year-old at the time of his parents’
                    death—to his granddaughter, who wrote about her possession of it in a letter to
                    the Wordsworths’ descendants.</p>
                  <p>Dorothy would have been highly gratified to have known of the Greens’ fondness
                    for her <title level="a">Narrative,</title> for she had always believed that those who
                    had personal knowledge of the subjects of her writing would be most appreciative of it.
                    This philosophy of writing was one of the reasons she published so little of what she
                    wrote and sometimes struggled to revise her work (like the Scotch tour) to ready
                    it for a wider, public audience. As she told Catherine Clarkson, she supported
                    the publication of the <title level="a">Narrative</title> after the Green children
                    were grown and out of danger of exploitation, and so would probably have approved of
                    Ernest de Sélincourt publishing the first print edition of the <title level="a">Narrative</title>
                    in 1936. Though much more time had passed than the “thirty or forty years”
                    Dorothy had asked for it to remain private, she had no objections, as noted previously,
                    to its publication, provided that “it should be thought that any service would be
                    done.”

                    William, in his prefatory inscription to the <title level="a">Narrative,</title> makes
                    explicit what this service is: “that of leaving behind a record of human sympathies,
                    and moral sentiments, either as they were called forth or brought to remembrance, by a 
                    distressful event.”</p>

                  <p>George Green and Sarah his Wife, Inhabitants of the Vale of Grasmere, having gone to
                Langdale on the morning of Saturday the 19th of March last, set off to return to
                their own house a lonely Dwelling on the same eve[n]ing, intending to cross over the
                mountain. They had left a Daughter at home, eleven years of age, with the care of
                five other children younger than herself, the youngest an infant at the breast. On
                Monday afternoon, one of the Boys went to the nearest house to borrow a Cloak for
                his Sister, who (he said) was going to Langdale to seek their Father and Mother, who
                had not returned as they had expected, on Saturday. Immediately the alarm was
                spread, and continual search was made, as long as daylight lasted, on that day, and
                the day following, and till Wednesday afternoon, when the Bodies of the unfortunate
                Persons were found. It is supposed they had been bewildered by the snow and mist;
                and they perished by falling over the rocks, they were buried in one Grave on the
                Friday afternoon. 
            </p>
                  <p>The unhappy Fate of this Pair, and the forlorn condition in which the children are
                left, have excited much compassion; which has been more deeply felt in their own
                neighbourhood because the Deceased were much respected for their good morals and
                decent manners, for their frugality and industry, and for the constant cheerfulness
                and independence of mind, with which, without any assistance from the parish, they
                supported their Family under the burthen of extreme poverty. This compassion has
                naturally been accompanied with a general desire that more than ordinary exertions
                should be made to befriend and protect the orphan children. It is therefore thought
                proper to draw up a brief statement of the condition of the Family, for the
                information of such persons as may be disposed to promote this benevolent design.
                </p>
                  <pb/>
                  <p>George Green had been twice married, and has left one Son and three Daughters by his
                first wife who do not stand in need of assistance. By her who died with him, he has
                left four Sons and four Daughters: the eldest of these, a Girl fifteen years of age,
                is at present in Service; the second, a girl likewise, is with a Family who will
                take care of her and fit her out, when she also is fit, for Service. One of the Boys
                will be maintained by his Father’s eldest Son, who will breed him up to his own
                business; so that there remain five children to be provided for.
            </p>
                  <p>The Father has left a small Estate which is deeply mortgaged, and it is probable that
                <hi rend="italic">after it is sold,</hi> little or nothing will remain for his
                children. The Parish have therefore agreed to allow, to each of these five children,
                two shillings per week till they are fit to go to Service or to be apprenticed. The
                object then of those Persons who interest themselves on this occasion, is to raise a
                Sum to make an addition to the weekly allowance of the Parish, by means of which the
                children may be placed in a respectable Family or Families: it is also intended to
                send them to School, and what money remains to be employed in setting them forward
                as Servants or Apprentices.
            </p>
                  <p>It is conceived that it will be grateful to benevolent Persons to promote a
                subscription for the above purpose: first, as a natural tribute of human Sympathy
                upon so melancholy an occasion; secondly, as a testimony of respect for the honesty,
                industry, patient and even cheerful endurance of extreme poverty by which the
                Deceased were distinguished: and lastly, and above all, that there may be a better
                hope that the children may go forward in that course of innocence and virtue in
                which their Parents have thus far conducted them.

                    days after the Interment there of a Man and his Wife, Inhabitants of the Vale,
                    who were lost upon the neighbouring Mountains, on the night of the nineteenth of
                    March last</title> (19 April 1808)
                 <note place="foot" resp="editors">Writing to STC two days later, WW explained the origins of this account:
                     “Within a day or two after my return home, when my mind was easier than it has been since, in passing through the churchyard I stopped at the grave of
                     the poor Sufferers and immediately afterwards composed the following stanzas; <hi rend="italic">composed</hi> I have said, I ought rather to have said effused,
                     for it is the mere pouring out of my own feeling; but if you can turn these verses to any profit for the poor Orphans in any way, either by reciting, 
                     circulating in manuscript, or publishing them, either with or without the name of the Author, pray do so” (2:219–220). DW copied this poem into 
                     WW’s 19 April 1808 letter to STC (see n1). It remained unpublished until 1839, when De Quincey printed
                    a substantially revised version in <title level="m">Tait’s Edinburgh Magazine</title> (see n3).</note>

                  <p>On 19 March 1808, a local married couple, George and Sarah Green, died attempting to
                cross Langdale Fell on their way home during a storm. They lived at the far end of
                Easedale, about two miles northwest of the Wordsworths, who were living in Dove
                Cottage, Town End, Grasmere, at the time and had employed one of the Greens’
                daughters, Sally, as a maid. The Greens’ deaths orphaned eight children under 
                the age of 16 and six under age 11, as well as six grown children by previous
                marriages.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">The eight young children of George and Sarah Green were Mary (b. 1793, age 15); Sarah, called
                     Sally (b. 1795, age 12); Jane (b. 1796, age 11); George (b. 1798, age 10); John (b. 1800, age 7); William (b. 1804, age 4); 
                     Thomas (b. 1805, age 3); and an infant “at the breast,” Hannah (b. 1807, age 1). George Green had a son and three
                     daughters by a prior marriage: Margaret (b. 1766); Betty (b. 1771); Agnes, or Aggy (b. 1775, d. 1842); and James (b. 1777, d.
                     1851). Sarah Green had had a son and a daughter before her marriage; both were in service in Langdale in 1808. Dates from

                George Green was 65, and Sarah, considerably younger at 43, had recently given birth
                to a baby girl.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Sarah’s age is never given by DW, but we draw information from the Greens’ gravestone,

                The loss of the parents threw “the whole vale,” in Dorothy 
                Wordsworth’s words, into “the greatest consternation.”

            </head>
                  <p>Nine days after the tragedy, Dorothy reported to her friend Catherine Clarkson that
               the Wordsworths had immediately been “employed in laying schemes to prevent the
               children from falling into the hands of persons who may use them unkindly.”
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:206, DW to Catherine Clarkson, 28 March 1808. DW also criticizes
                    the practice of orphans being boarded in the <title level="a">Narrative concerning George &amp; Sarah Green</title> (hereafter 
                    <title level="a">Narrative</title>) itself, describing how they were often given “to the lowest Bidder, that is, to board them 
                    out with Persons who will take them at the cheapest rate; and such as are the least able to provide for them properly are often the 
                    readiest Bidders, for the sake of having a little money coming in.” At 10 years of age, children were made parish apprentices,
                    “at best a slavish condition.” DW also explains how Sarah Green herself had “been a Parish Apprentice and therefore,
                    probably, a neglected Child.”</note>
                The specific fear was that the young Greens would suffer the usual fate of orphans, 
                being boarded out by the parish to foster families paid a mere two shillings per week
                per child. Accordingly, the Wordsworths began to solicit donations, and a brief 
                account of the events was written by William and circulated to those who might be 
                willing to contribute (see appendix A).
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">WW wrote letters asking for donations, enclosing the short description of the events, in extant 1808
                    letters to Richard Sharp (<title level="m">Letters</title> 2:210, 13 April) and Francis Wrangham (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:
                    211–12, 17 April). He and DW wrote letters acknowledging the receipt of funds to Lady Beaumont (<title level="m">Letters</title>,
                    2:224, 20 April), Richard Sharp (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:229–30, 25 April), Jane Marshall (<title level="m">Letters</title>,
                    2:234, 11 May), Lady Holland (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:253, 20 June), Walter Scott (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:263, 4
                    August), Samuel Rogers (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:267, 29 September), and again Francis Wrangham (<title level="m">Letters</title>,
                    2:269, 2 October).</note>
                It seems that the Wordsworths were tireless in their efforts, as William, in a letter
                to Francis Wrangham dated 17 April 1808, apologizes for the “dim transcript made
                by a multiplying writer, we having had occasion to make so many copies.”

                William urged Coleridge, who was then in London delivering a series of lectures, to 
                “turn these verses to any profit for the poor Orphans in any way, either by 
                reciting, circulating in manuscript or publishing them.” William also explained,
                “As soon as she has leisure Dorothy means to draw up a minute detail of all that
                she knows concerning the lives and characters of the Husband and Wife, and everything
                relating to their melancholy end, and its effect upon the Inhabitants of this Vale; a
                story that will be rich both in pleasure and profit.” Dorothy, in fact, had begun
                drafting her own record at roughly this same time, as evidenced by her noting near the
                beginning of her account, “It was a month yesterday since the sad event happened.”

                The end of the <title level="a">Narrative</title> is signed and dated 4 May 1808, suggesting that
                Dorothy completed it over a period of two weeks.</p>
                  <p>The success of the Wordsworths’ efforts in circulating requests for funds is
                immediately apparent upon perusal of the subscription book they kept to record
                donations pledged and received. By the middle of May 1808—just two months after the
                tragedy—more than £300 had been raised, and by September 1808 almost 300 donors had
                pledged nearly £500. Individual pledges varied, as we would expect, largely
                according to the means of the donor, ranging from the 10 guineas given by both the
                Bishop of Llandaff and Lord Muncaster to offerings of mere sixpences by local
                laboring people and servants, many of whom could probably ill afford even these
                small sums.</p>
                  <p>Somewhat surprisingly, so far as the records show, the Wordsworths made no direct
                monetary contribution themselves. This was probably owing to their own straitened
                financial circumstances in 1808 or rationalized in terms of their deciding to retain
                Sally Green after the tragedy instead of letting her go, which had been their plan.
                The Wordsworths’ belief that the charity bestowed upon the Greens had, in some way,
                to be circumscribed is readily apparent in their decision to cap at £500 the funds
                raised for the orphans in order not to raise the children above (or at least
                significantly above) their prior station.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Levy, <title level="a">The Wordsworths, the Greens,</title> 542.</note>
                This led to significant friction with Coleridge, who questioned both the belief that
                the subscription should be capped and the Wordsworths’ decision to sell the entire
                contents of the Greens’ cottage. Other hints of worry over possible unintended
                consequences of assisting the family occur in the <title level="a">Narrative.</title>
                Dorothy, for instance, notes the initial concerns of some genteel women who housed the
                children before their placement in new homes. Fears had been expressed that
                “wayward desires” in the children might be raised “by the luxuries
                among which they had lived for the last three weeks.” While Dorothy expresses 
                her relief (and that of the other women) “that [their] fears that this might 
                happen were ill-grounded,” the articulation of this worry is in itself revealing.</p>
                  <p>The Wordsworths were far from unassisted in supervising the collection of funds and
                the placement and upbringing of the Green children. The rector of Grasmere, the
                Reverend Thomas Jackson, agreed to act as trustee, and George Mackereth, the parish
                clerk, was appointed official collector. Six local women—Mrs. Watson (the wife of
                the Bishop of Llandaff), Mrs. Lloyd (wife of author Charles Lloyd), Mrs. King and
                Mrs. North (both recent settlers in the neighborhood), a Miss Knot, and William’s
                wife, Mary—were appointed to superintend the collection of subscriptions, administer
                the funds collected, and oversee the care of the children in their new homes. For
                the next 21 years, until the youngest Green children were able to support
                themselves, the trustees distributed the funds to the families who had taken in the
                younger orphaned children, deservedly earning Ernest de Sélincourt’s praise as
                “a model of a simple act of charity wisely conceived and scrupulously 
                administered.”
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">De Selincourt, <title level="m">A Narrative Concerning George and Sarah Green</title>, 11.</note>
                Surviving collections receipts in the Wordsworth Trust archives from the woman-led
                effort to finance the children’s schooling, medical care, and clothing allow
                historians to piece together a vivid portrait of the care of these children. 
                Dorothy’s <title level="a">Narrative</title> in particular demonstrates how
                the work of charity and caregiving was largely a female endeavor.</p>
                  <p>For the most part, these women worked harmoniously in the service of the children.
                Susan Levin has described Dorothy’s story as “an affirmation of a certain
                mode of social assistance” and a “positive description of a community in 
                which experience and relation of that experience almost conflate.”

                For Susan Wolfson, Dorothy’s general “social sensibility” throughout
                her prose and poetic works, including the <title level="a">Narrative,</title> 
                differentiates her writing from William’s “more solitary poetics.”
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors">Wolfson, <title level="a">Dorothy Wordsworth in Conversation with William,</title> 154.</note>
                Nevertheless, in the <title level="a">Narrative,</title> Dorothy cannot help criticizing
                one Mrs North, who “<del rend="strike">cannot do a charitable action without the 
                pleasure of being busy</del>.” As this strikethrough suggests, Dorothy censors 
                herself, deleting her bitter complaints and canceling her antagonist’s name. Elsewhere
                in the manuscript she writes, “I will not blemish a narrative of events so moving,
                which have brought forward so many kind and good feelings, by entering into the cabals 
                and heart-burnings of M<hi rend="sup">

                     </hi>
                     <del rend="strike">North.</del>” Throughout DCMS 64, Mrs. North’s name 
                is completely erased, revealing that Dorothy was sufficiently concerned about the
                circulation of the <title level="a">Narrative</title> to accentuate discretion as well as an impression of
                local solidarity.</p>

                utilizes Dorothy’s talents as a precise and compassionate recorder of speech and
                events. Both a keen observer of and a participant in this crisis, she brings the 
                perspectives of both an outsider and an insider: an outsider in that the Greens, as 
                poor farmers, belonged to a different class and moved in different social circles; and
                an insider in that, as an inhabitant of Grasmere Vale, she possessed a deep understanding
                of the Greens’ way of life and had a firsthand perspective on the aftermath of the
                parents’ untimely deaths.</p>

                  <p>Dorothy’s insider status is apparent in her direct addresses to her confidential

                and its opening line—“You remember a single Cottage at the foot of Blentern
                Gill”—is one of many nods to a knowing audience familiar with Grasmere and
                its environs (see fig. 4.1). While implicitly directed toward a broader, if still localized,
                readership, the more specific addressee of the <title level="a">Narrative</title> appears
                to have been Dorothy’s good friend Catherine Clarkson. The Clarksons urged Dorothy
                to publish the <title level="a">Narrative,</title> and a complete manuscript copy of the
                text remains in the Clarkson papers at the British Library.
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors">The manuscript copy (DCMS 64) used for our text and all quotations is held by the Wordsworth Trust (see <ref target="#Textual">Textual Note</ref>).</note>                                                                
                Throughout the <title level="a">Narrative,</title> Dorothy draws her anticipated readers
                into the story, inviting them directly to feel compassion for the Greens (“You will
                wonder how they lived at all and indeed I can scarcely tell you”), to participate in
                the unfolding of events (“It would not be easy to give you an idea of the suspense 
                and trouble in every face before the bodies were found”), and to identify with the 
                charitable actions of those who came to the aid of the orphans (“You will not wonder,
                after what I have said, that we have been anxious to preserve these Orphans”). In 
                this way, Dorothy assumes sympathetic readers, though at moments she acknowledges a gap 
                between her own feelings and those of readers like the Clarksons who lived outside the 
                Grasmere community: “I cannot give <hi rend="underline">you</hi> the same feelings
                that <hi rend="underline">I</hi> have of them as neighbours and fellow-inhabitants of this
                Vale; therefore what is in my mind a full and living picture will be to you but a feeble
                sketch.”</p>
                  <p>Dorothy’s <title level="a">Narrative</title> also assumes a readership familiar with and
                concerned about the fate of small landowners like the Greens who, despite their tireless labor,
                could barely subsist on their land. She describes the Greens as being
                
            <quote>the poorest People in the Vale, though they had a small estate of their own, and a
                Cow. This morsel of Land, now deeply mortgaged had been in the possession of the
                Family for generations, and they were loth to part with it: consequently, they had
                never had any assistance from the Parish.</quote>
                
                Dorothy offers many examples of their extreme poverty—how George Green, age 65,
                had to do odd jobs for neighbors and dig peat from his own land; how the children were
                hired out to work for local families; how, after their parents’ deaths, the orphans
                were found with no money, little food, and apparently on the edge of starvation:
                
            <quote>They must very soon have parted with their Land if they had lived; for their means
                were reduced by little and little till scarcely anything <hi rend="underline">but</hi>
                the <hi rend="underline">Land</hi> was left. The Cow was grown old; and they had not 
                money to buy another; they had sold their horse; and were in the habit of carrying any
                trifles <del rend="strike">that</del> they could spare out of house or stable to barter
                for potatoes or meal. Luxuries they had none—they never made tea, and when the 
                Neighbours went to look after the Children they found nothing in the house but two 
                boiling potatoes, a very little meal, a little bread, and three or four legs of lean 
                dried mutton.</quote>
                  </p>
                  <p>In such descriptions, Dorothy revisits an archetype that had figured in her journals
                and her brother’s poetry—<title level="a">Michael: A Pastoral Poem</title>
                being the best example of the story of a small landowner (or statesman, as they were 
                called) at risk of losing his land. Michael is forced to make a heartbreaking decision
                between selling his land and sending his son, Luke, to work in the city. Ultimately 
                choosing the latter proves both a terrible and futile decision, terrible because Luke
                becomes dissipated and never returns home, and futile because after his parents’
                deaths “the estate / Was sold, and went into a stranger’s hands”;
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">WW, <title level="a">Michael,</title> lines 474–75.</note>
                thus, both Luke and the land are lost. In a journal entry for 18 May 1800, Dorothy
                records a conversation with her neighbor, John Fisher, who similarly describes the
                extinction of the class of small landowners: “He talked much about the alteration
                in the times, &amp; observed that in a short time there would be only two ranks of
                people, the very rich &amp; the very poor, for those who have small estates says he
                are forced to sell, &amp; all the land goes into one hand.”

                For Dorothy and her audience, the Greens were similarly situated and equally tragic:
                they represented the passing away of a “pastoral” life (to use William’s
                subtitle), one that seemed increasingly under threat. It may be that drawing the plight
                of these families to public notice was “the work” that Thomas Clarkson had
                in mind in urging Dorothy to publish the narrative; a request that prompted her 
                well-known reply to Catherine Clarkson, on 9 December 1810, discussed in detail below.

                  </p>
                  <p>How much did the Wordsworths know about the Greens’ poverty prior to their deaths, 
               and were they willfully blind to it? In a 2003 essay, <title level="a">The Wordsworths, 
               the Greens, and the Limits of Sympathy,</title> I explored the social commentary in the
               <title level="a">Narrative,</title> in particular Dorothy’s representation of the
               Greens’ poverty and the nature and circumstances of the subscription raised for 
               the children. Two of the main claims advanced in the essay relate to Dorothy’s
               representation and treatment of the poor. Although Dorothy insists on a number of 
               occasions that she and her family were unaware of the Greens’ extreme deprivation—
               “Alas!,” she writes at one point, “we gained our knowledge [of their
               extreme poverty] since their death”—the <title level="a">Narrative</title>
               also betrays a sense of personal and collective guilt over having, perhaps willfully, 
               ignored so many warning signs. The Wordsworths possibly felt culpable, having had one
               of the older girls, Sally Green, in their service at the time of the tragedy. They knew,
               as Dorothy notes in the text, that “one of the little Girls, our own Sally or another,
               used to come to fetch [our used tea leaves] two long miles!” Just before the tragedy,
               the Wordsworths had insisted that the Greens purchase Sally two new shifts, or smocks, to 
               fit her out for service in their house, an expense Dorothy subsequently realized must have
               caused great hardship.</p>
                  <p>In attending the shop in Ambleside to see if the cloth for these shifts had been paid for 
               after the deaths of George and Sarah Green, and finding that it had, Dorothy reports that 
               many members of the local community had considered the Greens “rather ‘too 
               <hi rend="underline">Stiff,</hi>’ unwilling to receive favours but the
                ‘<hi rend="underline">keenest Payers</hi>’, always in a hurry to pay when they 
               <hi rend="underline">had</hi> money.” These remarks suggest the impossible situation
               that families like the Greens found themselves in: paying their debts subjected them to 
               being called prideful; yet no doubt they would have been subject to worse insults if they
               had not paid. In an age when accepting charity was considered a sign of weakness, one can
               see how the Greens were in a hopeless predicament. Dorothy is therefore at pains to 
               demonstrate the Greens’ worthiness, an effort to meet the standard that had been
               set for the deserving poor (one that is also found in William’s short narrative used
               to raise funds for the orphans; see appendix A). In William’s narrative, compassion
               for the children is “more deeply felt,” and “a general desire that more
               than ordinary exertions should be made” prevails because of the parents’ 
               “frugality and industry” and “even cheerful endurance of extreme poverty.” 
               In Dorothy’s account, she seems less willing to describe the Greens’ suffering 
               as evidence of moral strength, perhaps reflecting her own conflicted views about the treatment
               of the poor generally, and about her family’s treatment of the Greens specifically. 
               Indeed, in the most significant set of deletions in the <title level="a">Narrative,</title>
               she cancels several lines that embody this understanding of the Greens as willingly suffering
               the burden of poverty:
               
               <quote>… I must say that the general feelings have been purely kind and 
               benevolent, arising from compassion for the forlorn condition of the Orphans and from a 
               respectful regard for the memory of their Parents who <del rend="strike">with unexampled chearfulness, patience
               and self-denial, had supported themselves and their Family in extreme poverty; and</del> have
               left in them a living testimony of their own virtuous conduct: <del rend="strike">for the 
               Children’s manners (I again repeat it) are of one innocent,</del> [illegible deleted word]
               <del rend="strike">and affectionate in a remarkable degree, so that each of them has already 
               made Friends of</del> [illegible deleted word]. (30)</quote>
                                   
               These cancellations may suggest her inner conflict over such conceptions of the poor.</p>
                  <p>As noted previously, Dorothy writes the <title level="a">Narrative</title> as a local historian,
               describing a village and way of life in which she is embedded and about which she can be neither
               objective nor disinterested. She documents the mourning of an entire community. Not only does
               she relate her own knowledge of the Greens prior to the tragedy as well as that of others who
               knew them, but she also describes the affecting scenes of the children’s grief upon learning
               the fate of their parents and their struggles in settling into strange new homes. Much of what
               the <title level="a">Narrative</title> includes consists of what Dorothy describes as the 
               “fireside talk in our Cottages”; it is in such domestic settings, she writes, that
               one hears “the inner histories of Families, their lesser and greater cares, their 
               peculiar habits, and ways of life [that] are recorded in the breasts of their Fellow-inhabitants
               of the Vale.” In recording this “fireside talk,” Dorothy becomes the voice of
               the community, situating herself within a fellowship that not only rallies behind the orphans
               but also implicitly questions whether the village could have done more to help the family 
               before the parents’ death. Dorothy’s <title level="a">Narrative</title> evokes the 
               shared locality in which they live: Easedale, where the Greens made their home and the Wordsworths
               frequently rambled; the nearby fells upon which the Greens met their fate; the local homes into which
               the orphans are taken, temporarily and permanently. Dorothy is also very much present throughout
               the <title level="a">Narrative</title> as a character who experiences and expresses the sympathy
               on which the story turns. In reflecting on the place where the Greens were lost, she recalls her
               own experience “at the top of Blea Crag above Easedale Tarn, that very spot where I myself
               had sate down <hi rend="sup">&lt;three&gt;</hi> six years ago, unable to see a yard before me, or
               to go a step further over the Crags.” Anyone, she suggests, might have shared the Greens’
               fate, as a mountain-walker like Dorothy had special cause to know.</p>
                  <p>Dorothy’s sympathetic connection to the Greens must also have been related to her own status as
               an orphan: Dorothy and William (and their three brothers Richard, John, and Christopher) were, like the
               Green children, bereft of their parents at young ages: their mother died in 1778 and their father in 
               1783. Dorothy and William, again like the Greens, were sent to different relatives after the deaths of
               their parents, not seeing each other for nine years. By 1808, Dorothy had been reunited with her brother
               for a decade, yet she must have keenly understood the pain felt by the Green siblings, many of
               whom were separated though most of them, happily, remained in the same vale. Only the eldest boy, George
               (age 10), was placed with a relative, a half-brother in Ambleside; the rest of the younger Green children
               joined new families. Since, as Dorothy notes, “It had been declared with one voice by the people of
               the Parish, men and women, that the Infant and her [11-year-old] Sister Jane should not be parted,”
               they were together placed with a childless couple. The two youngest boys, William (age four) and Thomas
               (age three), both still “in petticoats,” were kept together in the home of a family with grown
               children. John (age seven) was taken in by John Fleming, a sheep farmer who had been a friend of his father.
               In contrast to Dorothy’s own experience as an orphan, being sent to a distant home in Halifax, West
               Yorkshire (and later to others, some welcoming and some less so), the Green children were all kept close
               to their native vale and placed with families that seemed genuinely devoted to them. As Dorothy concluded,
               “The general feelings have been purely kind and benevolent, arising from compassion for the forlorn
               condition of the Orphans and from a respectful regard for the memory of their Parents.”</p>

           </head>
                  <p>As detailed in the <ref target="#Textual">Textual and Editorial headnote</ref>, long after funds had been raised
              in aid of the Green children, Dorothy’s <title level="a">Narrative</title> was read and copied by
              family members and friends, and from very early on, she was urged to publish it. Dorothy’s response
              to Catherine Clarkson’s encouragement came in a letter dated 9 December 1810. It is worth quoting in
              full, as her famous refusal—“I should detest the idea of setting myself up as an Author”—
              is often taken out of context and misconstrued:
                
           <quote>My dear Friend I cannot express what pain I feel in refusing to grant any request of yours, and above all one
              in which dear Mr Clarkson joins so earnestly, but indeed I cannot have that narrative published. My reasons are
              entirely disconnected with myself, much as I should detest the idea of setting myself up as an Author. I should
              not object on that score as if it had been an invention of my own it might have been published without a name,
              and nobody would have thought of me. But on account of the Family of the Greens I cannot consent. Their story
              was only represented to the world in that narrative which was drawn up for the collecting of the subscription,
              so far as might tend to produce the end desired, but by publishing this narrative of mine I should bring the
              children forward to notice as Individuals, and we know not what injurious effect this might have upon them.
              Besides it appears to me that the events are too recent to be published in delicacy to others as well as to
              the children. I should be the more hurt at having to return such an answer to your request, if I could believe
              that the story would be of that service to the work which Mr Clarkson imagines. I cannot believe that it would
              do much for it. Thirty or forty years hence when the Characters of the children are formed and they can be no
              longer objects of curiosity, if it should be thought that any service would be done, it is my present wish that
              it should then be published whether I am alive or dead.

             Dorothy’s sensitivity to the children’s privacy trumps even the request of her dear friends, the
             Clarksons, and seems driven by concern that the orphaned children might be harmed, their story sensationalized.</p>
                  <p>Over thirty years after the deaths of George and Sarah Green, in 1839, Thomas De  Quincey, a well-known author who
             had moved into Dove Cottage after the Wordsworths relocated, revisited the episode in his essay 
             <title level="m">Recollections of Grasmere,</title> which was first published as the September 1839 installment
             of his <title level="m">Tait’s Edinburgh Magazine</title> series, <title level="a">Sketches of Life and Manners; from
             the Autobiography of an English Opium Eater.</title>
                     <note place="foot" resp="editors">It was also republished in the posthumous collection of De Quincey’s essays, 
                        <title level="m">Recollections of the Lakes and the Lake Poets</title> (1862).</note>
             De Quincey recollects that, after returning from a visit to the Lakes to Oxford in 1808, he received a letter from
             Dorothy “asking for any subscriptions [he] might succeed in obtaining, amongst [his] college friends, in aid
             of the funds then raising in behalf of an orphan family, who had become such by an affecting tragedy that had occurred
             within a few weeks from [his] visit to Grasmere.”
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">De Quincey, <title level="a">Sketches of Life and Manners,</title> 1:569.</note>
             Alluding to Dorothy’s as-yet-unpublished <title level="a">Narrative,</title> he describes how 
             “Miss Wordsworth’s simple but fervid memoir not being within my reach at this moment, I
             must trust to my own recollections and my own impressions to retrace the story.”</p>
                  <p>De Quincey proceeds with a lengthy, embellished account filled with details of both the Greens’
            death on the fells and of the children’s patient suffering that are not included in Dorothy’s
            account. It is not clear how he came by these details, though he did move to Grasmere in 1809, so it is
            possible he heard them from witnesses. Nevertheless, De Quincey transforms the narrative into melodrama.
            He describes how the Greens had been strongly warned against returning home via Langdale Fell, a point
            never mentioned in Dorothy’s account, and comments: “After this they were seen no more. 
            They had disappeared into the cloud of death.” He also invents the mounting fears of the 
            soon-to-be-orphaned Green children, imagining how “Every sound, every echo amongst the hills, was
            listened to for five hours, from seven to twelve.” Further adding a gothic flair to the tale, he
            writes, “Some time in the course of the evening—but it was late, and after midnight—the
            moon arose, and shed a torrent of light upon the Langdale fells, which had already, long before, witnessed
            in darkness the death of their parents.”</p>
                  <p>Dorothy, in contrast, describes the children patiently waiting, reasonably assuming their parents had stayed
             overnight in Langdale due to the weather. Whereas Dorothy’s account evidences a deep communal and human
             connection to the Greens, De Quincey’s treats this family catastrophe as an occasion for overwrought
             storytelling. At one point, in fact, he confesses to having entertained a party of American visitors “by
             conducting them through Grasmere into the little inner chamber of Easedale, and there, within sight of the
             solitary cottage, Blentarn Ghyll, telling them the story of the Greens.”
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">De Quincey, <title level="a">Sketches of Life and Manners,</title> 2:38.</note>
             In other words, albeit decades later, her once-intimate friend De Quincey exploited the Greens’ fate
             much in the way Dorothy feared.</p>
                  <p>Dorothy’s account thus remains the most reliable account of this Lakeland tragedy, providing extensive
            details about the lives of the Green family before the death of the parents, the events surrounding their
            deaths, and the community’s response. In addition to being the most informative, it is the least
            romanticized of the records, and also the most poignant.</p>

                  <p>The diplomatic transcription of the <title level="a">Narrative</title> that follows is taken from DCMS
               64, a blue, clothbound notebook in the collections of the Wordsworth Trust. Written on the cover of
               the notebook, in Dorothy’s hand, is the short title <title level="a">Narrative. The Greens 
               1808.</title> (see fig. 4.2). The notebook begins with a prefatory note by William, dated 11 May
               1808, explaining that the narrative was “drawn up” by Dorothy at his request (fig. 4.2).
               William adds that he “entreated that she would give a <hi rend="underline">minute detail</hi>
               of all the particulars which had come within her notice,” as a full report would better
               answer “the end for which the account was written . . . viz. that of leaving behind a record
               of human sympathies, and moral sentiments, either as they were called forth or brought to remembrance”
               by the tragic deaths of George and Sarah Green in March. On the first page of the <title level="a">Narrative,</title>
               Dorothy provides the full title as <title level="a">A Narrative concerning George &amp; Sarah Green of
               the Parish of Grasmere addressed to a Friend.</title> The notebook contains thirty leaves, and the page
               size varies slightly, averaging approximately 240mm x 190mm (h x w). The notebook appears to have been
               made by a stationer, as the paper board cover is original (fig. 4.2).</p>

                  </figure>
                  <p>Dorothy’s <title level="a">Narrative</title> fills the entire rest of the notebook now catalogued
               as DCMS 64. She paginated it from page 2 to the end of the <title level="a">Narrative</title> on page 43.
               After a few blank leaves following the end of the main text, she added four pages of notes. As may be
               seen in figure 4.1, a representative page, the copy is largely fair, suggesting that she was probably
               working from a previous draft, but there are considerable revisions throughout. In our digital edition,
               the text is presented as a diplomatic transcription that respects as much as possible the text and
               layout of the original (including line, paragraph, and page breaks).</p>
                  <p>Dorothy’s handwritten revisions within DCMS 64 may be divided into three main categories:</p>
                  <list rend="numbered">
                     <item>Those she seemingly made while drafting the original or shortly
                        thereafter. All of these changes are minor and reflect immediate
                        second thoughts.</item>
                     <item>Those made in ink at a somewhat later date. Chiefly, these are
                        cancellations of lines or passages like the aforementioned complaints about
                        Mrs. North. She also cancels William and Mary’s names in one place,
                        substituting “my brother and sister.” In another, she replaces
                        “William” with “my brother.” Further, she softens
                        some descriptions of the Greens that might have been perceived as negative.
                        These revisions and cancels are often made with a noticeably darker ink.</item>
                     <item>Those made in pencil, possibly later still. For the most part, these
                        revisions are insubstantial, making minor corrections or simply recopying
                        the same words (a practice seen in Dorothy’s other manuscripts). She does,
                        however, add one substantial note in pencil, the final one, which recounts
                        the tragic death of the villager Mary Watson (see note to page 38).</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>In total, there are five known manuscripts of the <title level="a">Narrative.</title>
                    Three are autograph copies, two of which are complete (DCMS 64 and British Library
                    Add MS 41267) and one incomplete (DCMS 51). The remaining two (DCMS 167 and WLMSH/2/5)
                    are transcriptions made by other hands, as described in the following
                    paragraphs. All copies except the British Library autograph are held by the
                    Wordsworth Trust. We have selected DCMS 64 as our copy-text because it is
                    Dorothy’s personal copy, the one to which she returned to reread and make
                    revisions. The handwriting is fair, with most of the revisions and cancels
                    having been added later, as can be determined by the differences in ink and by
                    the nature of the revisions, most of which appear to have been made to mask the
                    identity of some of the individuals involved, for reasons of tact or clarity.
                    (Such changes were typical of Dorothy, especially when she contemplated
                    publishing her manuscript materials or sharing them with new audiences.) Dorothy
                    also added notes to the end of the <title level="a">Narrative</title> that relate
                    to events that took place many years after 1808. If there had been a preceding
                    draft, it has not survived.</p>
                  <p>The British Library (BL) copy (Add MS 41267), part of the Clarkson Papers
                    collection, is almost entirely fair, written in a neat hand with very few
                    revisions. Like DCMS 64, it is dated 4 May 1808, but it seems unlikely that
                    Dorothy completed this copy on the same day as she did DCMS 64, meaning she
                    likely just reproduced the date from DCMS 64. As the BL catalogue entry notes,
                    Catherine Clarkson is probably the “friend” mentioned in the title
                    and the original dedicatee of the narrative. At the end of a letter dated 9 
                    February 1812, Clarkson writes to Dorothy, “Don’t forget your promise of
                    giving me a copy of your Narrative in your own hand-writing.”
                            <note place="foot" resp="editors">Catherine Clarkson to DW, 9 February 1812, cataloged as 
                                f.36 in the Clarkson Papers, Add MS41267 A: 1787–1853, British Library.</note>
                    Clarkson had certainly read a copy of the <title level="a">Narrative</title>
                    earlier, as is evidenced by her letter of 9 December 1810 urging Dorothy to
                    publish it, but perhaps she never had her own copy prior to 1812. The paper in
                    the BL manuscript of the <title level="a">Narrative</title> is watermarked 1808;
                    however, this tells us only that the text was copied sometime after 1808—Dorothy
                    might have had the paper for some time. So, it seems likely that the BL
                    <title level="m">Narrative</title> was made after Clarkson’s
                    1812 request, on paper from 1808, or that Dorothy simply sent Clarkson a copy
                    she had made earlier. Some, but not all, of the revisions to DCMS 64 are
                    duplicated in the BL manuscript, suggesting either that some revisions to the
                    notebook were added after the BL copy had been made or that Dorothy did not wish
                    to retain some of the revisions in the copy.</p>
                  <p>The only surviving autograph version of the <title level="a">Narrative</title>
                    besides DCMS 64 and the BL copy is an excerpt in DCMS 51, a miscellany in which
                    Dorothy copied various poems and narratives. After including William’s 
                    inscription and four pages of the <title level="a">Narrative,</title> it ends
                    mid-sentence in a paragraph found in the middle of page 5 of DCMS 64. Like the
                    BL copy, the DCMS 51 version appears to have postdated DCMS 64. It includes only
                    one small correction, made on the first page in the course of copying. It does
                    not include any of what appear to be the later revisions to DCMS 64.</p>
                  <p>Our edition notes any textual discrepancies between the two complete surviving
                    autograph versions (DCMS 64 and the BL/Clarkson copy). Assuming that DCMS 64 was
                    Dorothy’s copytext for the BL version, she made minor revisions in the process
                    of transcribing.</p>
                  <p>One of the two complete contemporaneous copies of the <title level="a">Narrative</title>
                    in other hands, DCMS 167, was, according to a note at its end, “transcribed by
                    Miss Fletcher now Lady Richardson.” Mary, Lady Richardson (1802–1880) lived
                    in Easedale for several years. Her mother, Mrs. Mary Fletcher (1770–1858) had
                    visited the Lakes on several occasions and in 1839, with the help of William Wordsworth,
                    had purchased, with her husband, Lancrigg Farm in Easedale. Her youngest daughter, Mary,
                    who transcribed the <title level="a">Narrative,</title> lived at the farm with her
                    parents until her marriage in 1847. It is likely that her interest in the Greens’
                    story came about because the family’s residence was near the cottage where the
                    Greens had lived (and which remains there today). As the Fletchers did not move to
                    Easedale until 1839, the <title level="a">Narrative</title> was likely not copied until
                    some time later, suggesting ongoing interest in the story. The other copy, WLMSH/2/5,
                    was transcribed by Mary Wordsworth’s sister Sara Hutchinson. The year in which this
                    transcript was made is not known.</p>
                  <p>The number of extant copies demonstrates the significance the <title level="a">Narrative</title>
                    held for the Wordsworths and their social circle, as a document meant to record an important
                    incident in the life of the village but also to travel widely. In 1839, De Quincey reports
                    his understanding that the <title level="a">Narrative</title> “went into the hands
                    of the royal family; at any rate, the august ladies of that house (all or some of them)
                    were amongst the many subscribers to the orphan children.”

                    The highest number of complete manuscript copies of a work by Dorothy that survives is five,
                    for the <title level="m">Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland, A.D, 1803</title>.
                    However, the <title level="a">Narrative</title> is a close second with four complete
                    manuscripts and one partial copy. In contrast, Dorothy’s <title level="m">Journal
                    of a Tour of the Continent, 1820</title> survives in only a single copy, as is the case
                    with her Grasmere journal notebooks, which were evidently not meant to be shared outside
                    of the household.</p>
                  <p>A November 1850 letter from Mary Wordsworth to her sister-in-law Mary Monkhouse
                    Hutchinson establishes that the <title level="a">Narrative</title> was still being
                    circulated and copied four decades after its composition. Midway through this letter,
                    the then-80-year-old Mary Wordsworth asks whether Monkhouse’s daughters, Elizabeth
                    and Sarah, had “ever beg[u]n to copy the Green’s Narrative and if so what they
                    did with it.” Apparently, Fanny Wordsworth, wife of William Jr., had recently
                    reported, “Eliz. was about it when she was at Carlisle, and Sarah talked of
                    doing it at the Cooksons.” Since, as Mary Wordsworth explains, the Green “family
                    have applied again for it,” her recently deceased husband’s long-time clerk,
                    John Carter, “is ready to make them a Copy, if he hears one is not in forwardness.”

                    The copy eventually sent to the Greens, the present whereabouts of which are unknown,
                    was passed down from John Green—a seven-year-old at the time of his parents’
                    death—to his granddaughter, who wrote about her possession of it in a letter to
                    the Wordsworths’ descendants.</p>
                  <p>Dorothy would have been highly gratified to have known of the Greens’ fondness
                    for her <title level="a">Narrative,</title> for she had always believed that those who
                    had personal knowledge of the subjects of her writing would be most appreciative of it.
                    This philosophy of writing was one of the reasons she published so little of what she
                    wrote and sometimes struggled to revise her work (like the Scotch tour) to ready
                    it for a wider, public audience. As she told Catherine Clarkson, she supported
                    the publication of the <title level="a">Narrative</title> after the Green children
                    were grown and out of danger of exploitation, and so would probably have approved of
                    Ernest de Sélincourt publishing the first print edition of the <title level="a">Narrative</title>
                    in 1936. Though much more time had passed than the “thirty or forty years”
                    Dorothy had asked for it to remain private, she had no objections, as noted previously,
                    to its publication, provided that “it should be thought that any service would be
                    done.”

                    William, in his prefatory inscription to the <title level="a">Narrative,</title> makes
                    explicit what this service is: “that of leaving behind a record of human sympathies,
                    and moral sentiments, either as they were called forth or brought to remembrance, by a 
                    distressful event.”</p>

                  <p>This section of our edition features Dorothy Wordsworth’s account of climbing Scafell Pike,
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">“Scaw Fell” and “Scawfell” were common spellings in DW’s time, but today the accepted
                    form is “Scafell Pike.”</note> England’s highest mountain, in 1818. A revised and abbreviated version of the text appeared under
                    her brother William’s name in his <title level="m">Description of the Scenery of the Lakes in the North of England</title> (1822), 
                    the first stand-alone edition of the work, now commonly known as Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> (figs. 5.1 and 5.2).

                        <title level="m">A Description of the Scenery of the Lakes in the North of England</title> (1822) was the third printing of WW’s essay
                    but the first in the form of a guidebook. On the textual history of Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title>, see the 2015

                    Since subsequent editions of William’s <title level="m">Guide</title> continued to present her description of the ascent as his, Dorothy’s authorship was not broadly
                    acknowledged until 1941, when Ernest de Sélincourt included the full text in his important edition of her journals.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <title level="a">Excursion up Scawfell Pike</title> is the final item in De Sélincourt’s 
                    <title level="m">DWJ</title>, vol. 1 (423–30). De Sélincourt had earlier described and quoted from <title level="a">Excursion</title> in his 1933 
                    <title level="m">DWB</title> (313–16), but this was the first time the text was presented in full.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the <title level="m">Guide</title>, William introduced Dorothy’s narrative as an “extract from a letter to a Friend.”
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">WW’s “extract from a letter” explanation first appeared in the 
                    <ref target="/editions.DW.editions.2023.DW.SP-C.html">1822 <title level="m">Guide</title>
                        </ref> (129).</note>
                    While this attribution was technically accurate, as Dorothy did send the account in a letter to their mutual friend, 
                    the Reverend William Johnson, William never mentioned that the source was his sister’s letter, leaving readers to assume that he was its author. 
                    Later writers of travel books, drawing on the <title level="m">Guide</title>, enthusiastically quoted Dorothy’s language as if it were William’s and supposed that 
                    he had made the climb. For over a century, then, devotees of the poet intent on emulating his ascent remained unaware that it was, in fact, Dorothy’s 
                    footsteps that they were retracing.</p>

                  <p>Dorothy’s description of her ascent, which De Sélincourt called <title level="a">Excursion up Scawfell Pike,</title> is remarkable for at least two related reasons. 
                    First, it is a landmark in the history of British mountaineering—one of the earliest reports of a recreational climb of Scafell Pike (3,209 ft., or 978 m) 
                    and the first by a woman.
                   <note place="foot" resp="editors">DW’s account of climbing Scafell Pike was not quite the first. In <title level="m">The Tourist’s New Guide</title> (1819), 
                    William Green described summiting the mountain with Jonathan Otley in September 1816 and noted that Otley had already done so with Edward Birkett in June 1815 (2:318–26).
                    If, as Green claims, he began writing his book in late 1816 and printing it in 1817 (1:vii), his account predated DW’s. It was certainly first in print, as DW’s 
                    did not appear until 1822.</note>
                  Second, it captures an aspect of Dorothy’s life that has sometimes been overlooked. Dorothy Wordsworth was a prodigious walker—this
                    fact is well known—but her pioneering achievements as a mountaineer have insufficiently shaped the public’s memory of her.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Happily, recent scholarship has helped bring DW’s mountaineering into view. See especially Simon Bainbridge’s 
                    <title level="m">Mountaineering and British Romanticism</title>, chapter 7.</note>
                     <title level="a">Excursion</title> helps us reimagine Dorothy on the fells,
                    representing one of her most dramatic walks in the vibrant prose for which she is famous.</p>
                  <p>Of course, recovering Dorothy’s place in mountaineering history requires bringing her <title level="a">Excursion</title> out of the shadow of her brother’s writing.
                    One admirer subtly pointed this out in 1855, the year of Dorothy’s death. In a letter to the editor of the <title level="m">Kendal Mercury</title>, venerable mountain guide 
                    Jonathan Otley hinted that there was more to tell about the now-famous Scafell Pike adventure: “The story of the ascent of Scawfell, in Wordsworth’s Guide, said in some
                    former editions to be extracted from a letter to a friend; and in the last edition from a letter by a friend, is well told, and is good as far as it goes; but it might have been 
                    improved by a prefatory introduction, and extended by an appendix.”
                  <note place="foot" resp="editors">Appearing in the 26 May 1855 issue under the anagrammatic pen name “Anthony Loajet,” Otley’s
                    <title level="m">Kendal Mercury</title> letter was occasioned by the recent publication of Harriet Martineau’s <title level="m">Complete Guide
                    to the English Lakes</title>. Although he did not say so, he must have known that DW (recently deceased) was the  letter-writing “friend.”
                    The textual change he mentions occurred in the second and third editions of Hudson’s <title level="m">A Complete Guide to the Lakes</title>
                    (1843, 1846), which incorporated WW’s <title level="m">Guide</title> but added supplementary materials.</note>
                  Our introduction and editorial apparatus should perform the record-expanding services that Otley imagined, 
                    restoring a historic experience and its documentation to the rightful owner: Dorothy Wordsworth.</p>

            </head>
                  <p>On Wednesday, 7 October 1818, Dorothy Wordsworth (age 46) and her friend Mary Barker (age 44) climbed Scafell Pike, the highest mountain in England. 
                  They were joined by a shepherd-guide (John Allison, Barker’s neighbor), a porter, and Barker’s maid (Agnes)—none of whom were named in Dorothy’s account of 
                  the adventure.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">We owe the names of John Allison (1787–1855) and Agnes to Otley, who includes them in the 
                  <title level="m">Kendal Mercury</title> letter previously cited. Otley was unreliable in some details, but he knew the people concerned and was 
                  sound in his basic recollections. While the names of the maid and guide do not appear in DW’s narrative, we include them in part to counteract the tendency to
                  mythologize writer-mountaineers while overlooking those who accompanied them and helped make their accomplishments possible. Agnes was obviously a fit and trusted 
                  companion for Mary Barker, though we know little more about her. Perhaps John Allison was no Tenzing Norgay, but he deserves honorable mention in the history of 
                  British mountaineering alongside other shepherd-guides of the early days. About the unnamed porter, unfortunately, we know nothing at all.
                  <p>Regarding Agnes, see various letters of SH and DW’s own <title level="m">Journal of a Tour on the Continent</title> (1820), in which she reports on 
                  visiting Mary Barker at Boulogne. At this reunion, the party “had Borrowdale Agnes to wait upon us, a little frenchified in exterior,
                  it is true, but retaining her good Cumberland speech” (<title level="m">DWJ</title>, 2:331). John Allison’s life is otherwise documented. 
                  His grave marker survives at St. Andrew’s Churchyard, Stonethwaite. Fittingly, given his occupation, the stone features a ram and ewe with their 
                  lambs and the inscription “Jesus Saith Feed My Sheep.” A brief obituary appeared in the <title level="m">Carlisle Patriot</title> 
                  for 27 January: “At Rosthwaite, in Borrowdale, John Allison, on the 22nd inst., Mr. John Allison, yeoman, aged 68.” 
                  Given that Allison and DW passed away within three days of each other in January 1855, Otley’s May letter can perhaps be understood as a tribute to both.</p>
                     </note> 
                  They walked an ambitious nine-mile loop that took the better part of a day: Dorothy reports setting out in the morning and finishing as the first stars appeared over Borrowdale.</p>
                  <p>For Dorothy, this hike was the culmination of a season spent among brilliant associates. Her old acquaintance William Wilberforce, the statesman and abolitionist, 
                  had arrived in the Lake District with his family in late August 1818 and spent most of September at Rydal to be near the Wordsworths. Sir George and Lady Beaumont, 
                  dear friends and prominent art patrons, also visited Rydal in September.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Prior to this, the Beaumonts had been visiting mutual friends, 
                  the Marshalls, at Hallsteads on Ullswater—perhaps one reason why DW wrote to Jane Marshall on 14 October to report on recent adventures.</note> 
                  In early October, the Wilberforces decamped to nearby Keswick, where Dorothy and the Beaumonts soon joined them. (William Wordsworth, meanwhile, was occupied with political business).
                  <note place="foot" resp="editors">WW missed out on several opportunities that year due to absorption in the Westmorland election and its aftermath. In late June, John Keats 
                  tried to visit him at Rydal Mount and lamented that the older poet was out canvassing for the Lowther interest. Famously, several writers of the younger generation condemned 
                  his active engagement in Tory politics. DW, for her part, supported WW’s efforts. For accounts of DW’s Scafell Pike walk set against the context of late 1818,
                  see <title level="m">DWB</title>, chapter 16 and <title level="m">Gittings</title>, chapter 15.</note>
                  Learning of this gathering in Keswick, Mary Barker invited 
                  the whole group to dine at her new home in Rosthwaite, Borrowdale, six miles to the south (fig. 5.3).</p>

                  <p>A writer, artist, and music teacher, Mary Barker had lived next door to the Robert Southey family in Keswick between 1812 and 1817. She 
                  soon became intimate with the larger “Lake Poet” circle, and in 1814, Dorothy described her to Catherine Clarkson as the epitome 
                  of “Generosity, Frankness, Sincerity, and perfect disinterestedness.”
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">In her letter to Caroline Clarkson, 24 April 1814, DW takes Barker’s part in a dispute with the Southey and Coleridge women
                  next door. She and Barker had been nursing Basil Montagu junior together for several weeks, and this had been an important season for the solidification of their 
                  friendship (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 3:137–44).</note>
                Dorothy also mentioned her friend’s “warm temper” and “disdain 
                  [for concealing] her opinions.” Barker was passionate, funny, and independent.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">Barker’s nicknames included “The 
                  Senhora,” “The Colonel,” and “The Major.” Gittings characterizes Barker as a “rollicking spinster” (215), and 
                  Susan Wolfson as a “gender-fluid personality” (<title level="a">Two Wordsworths,</title> 69). The most thorough biographical treatment of 
                  Barker is David Bradbury’s <title level="m">Senhora Small Fry: Mary Barker and the Lake Poets</title> (2003). Barker is a major presence in Southey’s 
                  correspondence, and she sometimes appears in footnotes to literary history as the author of a 1798 novel, <title level="m">A Welsh Story</title>; as 
                  the “Bhow Begum” of Southey’s <title level="m">The Doctor</title>; or as the writer of the satirical <title level="a">Lines Addressed to 
                  a Noble Lord [Lord Byron] by one of the Small Fry of the Lakes.</title>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though impractical,<note place="foot" resp="editors">Southey dubbed Barker’s new home “Barker’s Folly,” in part because it overtaxed her income
                  (see letter <ref target="/editions/southey_letters/Part_Five/HTML/letterEEd.26.2854.html">2584</ref> in
                  <title level="m">Romantic Circles Electronic Edition</title>). Sara Coleridge offered details in a 4 June 1819 letter: “Our friend, Miss Barker . . . [,]
                  with an annuity of 400 a year, and 1200 pounds in money . . . [,] is obliged to leave us, and a house in Borrowdale half finished (the foolish building of which,
                  has caused this temporary ruin) and retire to France to live in her Uncle’s house, at Boulogne until her annuity can pay her debts. This is the precious fruits
                  of having <hi rend="italic">a taste for magnificence</hi>. We are sorry to part with her, and so are the Wordsworths, for she was lively, sensible, and accomplished”
                  (Potter, <title level="m">Minnow among Tritons</title>, 76). Because Barker moved to Boulogne in 1819 and never returned to England, the October 1818 walk was one of the
                  last chances for her and DW to make such a memory.</note> relatively isolated, and built alongside a flood-prone branch of the River Derwent, Mary Barker’s new home was
                  nonetheless ideal for hosting friends who shared her taste for mountain scenery.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">William Green mentioned Barker’s new home and its setting
                  in his <title level="m">Tourist’s New Guide</title> (1819): “On the banks of the Stonethwaite arm of the Derwent, there has recently been erected, by Miss Barker,
                  an excellent house, commanding a fine view over the river. . . . There is scarcely amongst these northern vallies, a place, in which an equally valuable collection of
                  painters’ studies may be so speedily collected, as from the environs of Rosthwaite” (2:136).</note>
                Dorothy went there on the morning of 5 October, possibly to
                  help with preparations for the dinner. Then, on 6 October, the Wilberforce entourage and the Beaumonts made their way into Borrowdale “with store of provisions,”
                  while Barker “provided vegetables, etc.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">These details appear in DW’s letter to Jane Marshall, 14 October 1818 
                  (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 3:494–97).</note> In a period famous for its “immortal” dinners, this was a gathering worthy of remembrance.</p>
                  <p>In the course of conversation, the Wilberforces expressed their intent to ride up Skiddaw (3,054 ft., 931 m), the far-famed mountain overlooking Keswick, on the
                  following morning, and the Beaumonts pledged to accompany them. Wilberforce would be revisiting an ascent he made years earlier while touring the Lakes as a young
                  man. Accordingly, most of the visitors returned to Keswick for the night, looking forward to their outing, but Dorothy stayed at Rosthwaite. She and her host settled
                  on their own hiking plan. Thus, as Dorothy reports, she and Mary Barker summited Scafell Pike on the same day their friends explored Skiddaw, 14 miles to the north.
                  The Skiddaw excursion was less ambitious than the Scafell Pike ascent; still, as Wilberforce was in his late 50s and the Beaumonts in their 60s, none of them in perfect
                  health, we should admire the spirit of this group as well—not least because they got a good wetting in the rain.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The Skiddaw
                  ascent must have been a challenge for at least some of the group. William Green, who coincidentally met with the party on the mountain, left a humorous journal
                  entry in which he described Sir George Beaumont as “Sir George Breadth” (original owned by Lakeland Arts in Kendal). Green himself was now in his
                  late 50s but was still an enthusiastic walker of the fells.</note> Meanwhile, from high in the mountains above Borrowdale, Dorothy and Mary, enjoying comparatively
                  mild weather themselves, saw rainbows over Skiddaw and felt grateful that the weather had eventually cleared for their friends.</p>
                  <p>Dorothy and Mary Barker did not at first aim to climb Scafell Pike—their original goal was to ascend Esk Hause (2,490 ft.), a high pass that on a clear day would
                  afford excellent views of the surrounding peaks and valleys. Barker, of late “an active climber of the hills,” had recently been to Esk Hause and was eager
                  to share the “magnificent prospect.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">We are indebted to Otley for this knowledge, though DW hints at it by mentioning that
                  Barker confidently promised her fantastic views from Esk Hause. On the earlier occasion, Otley reports, “Miss B. was so enraptured with the prospect that it
                  was not till her maid reminded her that the sun was going down, that she could think of leaving the place; vowing that she would visit it again ere long.”
                  She and Agnes had to find their own way down into Borrowdale, having been abandoned by their guide. At Seathwaite, they happened to meet John Allison, who promised
                  to “direct [Miss Barker] by a better route than the one by which she had descended.” Later, when DW visited, “[the friends] fixed upon an excursion,
                  and called upon Mr. Allinson [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] to redeem his promise” (<title level="m">Kendal Mercury</title>, 26 May 1855, 6).</note> However, 
                  when the friends arrived at the pass, they decided to press on. As Dorothy reports, their “spirit of enterprise” did not fail, and they climbed where, so
                  far as we can tell, few other recreational walkers had been.</p>
                  <p>Because it was a fine day, they could see for miles in every direction. Heart-stopping views like this were relatively uncommon in an age unfamiliar with air travel and
                 satellite imagery. However, Dorothy characteristically noticed close-range features as well as the vast panorama. She observed, for instance, that the rocks were 
                 “covered with never-dying lichens . . . adorn[ed] with colours of the most vivid and exquisite beauty.” She also observed the extreme silence of the summit,
                 having had the sound of mountain streams in her ears for much of the ascent.</p>
                  <p>Despite her emphasis on accurate description, Dorothy explored the limits of her perceptions. Looking out from the mountain to the sea (over 12 miles away), she supposed
                 she saw a ship. “<hi rend="italic">Is</hi> it a ship?” her smiling guide asked. Barker quickly supported Dorothy’s conclusion: “A ship, yes, it can be
                 nothing else.” However, a moment later, the “ship” had become a horse, for in fact the friends had been watching a cloud. Dorothy enjoyed this joke on
                 herself, resolving to remember it when she was “again inclined to positiveness.” Like many great Romantic texts, Dorothy’s <title level="a">Excursion</title>
                 reminds us that what we see depends to some extent on prior experience, perspective, and imagination.</p>
                  <p>Reading Dorothy’s account, one gets the impression that she was pleased with herself, and rightly so. She remarks upon the “continuance of that 
                 vigour of body, which enabled me to climb the high mountain, as in the days of my youth” and reports that she and Barker each dashed off a 
                 triumphant letter to Sara Hutchinson
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">SH was of course the sister of WW’s wife, Mary, close to DW, and a friend also 
                 to Mary Barker. A keen mountaineer in her own right, she was an integral part of the Wordsworth circle, perhaps most famous now for being the 
                 longtime object of STC’s passion. She may be the most important shadow character in the history of DW’s Scafell Pike ascent and the writing 
                 that emerged from it. On this subject, see our speculations <ref target="#In-addition">below</ref> on DW’s memory of STC’s 1802 Scafell ascent and also our appendix on 
                 the <ref target="/editions.DW.editions.2023.DW.SP-B.html">Kenyon Transcript</ref>.</note> from the summit.
                 (It is remarkable to think of them carrying pens, paper, and ink, if not also something to write on—no wonder they secured the help 
                 of a porter!) A week later, Dorothy wrote briefly about the experience to her old friend Jane Marshall,<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <ref target="/editions.DW.editions.2023.DW.SP-C.html#Marshall">Jane Marshall (née Pollard)</ref> and DW had been friends since their childhood days in Halifax. Jane was married to John Marshall,
                 a wealthy linen manufacturer and politician from Leeds, and now lived at Hallsteads, a fine house on the shore of Ullswater near Watermillock.</note> and a week 
                 after that she composed the longer, more circumstantial letter to William Johnson that forms (indirectly, as explained in our textual and editorial section) the 
                 basis of our edited text, speaking of the “feat” she and Barker had performed and aptly calling it an “uncommon performance.” Then, before 
                 mailing the letter, she copied it into one of her notebooks for preservation. She and her companion had broken with social convention and done something worth 
                 remembering and sharing. Part of their enjoyment, clearly, was writing about it.</p>

                </head>
                  <p>When Dorothy Wordsworth climbed Scafell Pike, this mountain—which had been proven to be England’s highest peak by Joseph Banks’s Trigonometrical Survey in 1790
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">Though the Trigonometrical Survey had confirmed the preeminence of Scafell Pike, it appears that the news was not yet universally
                accepted. DW and Mary Barker thought that neighboring Scafell was the higher peak and found out otherwise only after their ascent. Then, in the 
                <title level="m">Guide</title>, WW introduced DW’s account by saying that it recorded “a visit to a summit of one of the highest of these mountains,”
                as if he were not certain of its claim to be <hi rend="italic">the</hi> highest (<title level="m">A Description of the Scenery of the Lakes</title> [1822],

                popularity in recent years, the vast majority of Lake District pedestrians tended to stick to well-established routes around the central valleys.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">WW makes this point himself in <title level="m">Select Views</title>: “But it must be observed that the visits of travellers 
                are for the most part confined to the Vales of Coniston, Winandermere with the intermediate country between Ambleside and Keswick, the Vale of Keswick itself, 
                Buttermere, and Ulswater, which are the most easy of access, and indeed from their several characters most likely to repay general curiosity” 
                (iii—<ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.1810.html#:~:text=of%20the%20wheel.-,4.%C2%A0,-Such%2C%20concisely%20given"> 
                para. 4</ref> in RC <title level="m">Select Views edition</title>). In short, Romantic-era visitors normally looked <hi rend="italic">up</hi> at the Lake 
                District’s mountains, and when (increasingly) they did seek out the high places, they usually climbed Skiddaw or the more challenging Helvellyn.</note> 
                Maps of the mountains included limited detail, and those enterprising tourists who did explore them generally depended on local guides. In subsequent decades,
                of course, mountain walks became common practice and guidebook staples. Scafell Pike in particular became a rite of passage for Lakeland peak-baggers. Dorothy
                and her friends played a part in bringing about this shift, though relatively few people knew this.</p>
                  <p>The perennial challenge in studies of Dorothy Wordsworth has been her tendency to disappear, a propensity abetted by William’s habit of absorbing her work and by
                models of literary history that have undervalued the kinds of writing she did and the methods she used to share it. Readers often locate her influence indirectly,
                in poems of William’s that rework her journal entries, in letters that reveal her collaboration, and so forth, but except on occasions when William mentions her
                directly or includes her verses in his collections, it is often difficult to say, “There it is—there’s Dorothy’s mark.”</p>
                  <p>Yet Dorothy’s mark is visible on England’s highest mountain, where walkers have unwittingly followed her footsteps for two centuries now. Almost literally, you find
               those footsteps inscribed on the landscape in the form of trails (fig. 5.4). To be sure, many aspects of trail-making are determined by practical factors unrelated
               to literary history, but Dorothy’s Scafell Pike route has endured partly because of her writing’s intersection with the nineteenth century’s multiplication of maps
               and guidebooks.</p>

                    on 7 October 1818, ascending from Seathwaite via Grains Gill and returning by way of
                    Sty Head. This loop remains easily traceable on maps today. (Created by Paul
                    Westover and Teresa Gomez, Brigham Young University)</figDesc>
                  </figure>
                  <p>Dorothy observed of Scafell Pike’s rocky summit, “No gems or flowers can surpass in colouring the beauty of some of these masses of stone which no human 
                 eye beholds except the shepherd led thither by chance or traveler by curiosity; and how seldom this must happen!”—seldom because, as she noted, 
                 sheep would find little in the rocks to eat, and because recreational fell-walking there was still in its early days. However, once Dorothy’s letter found 
                 its way into William’s <title level="m">Guide</title>, a transformative process began. By incorporating Dorothy’s ascent narrative (not far removed in genre
                 from accounts that would later appear in Alfred Wainwright’s books and on trekking websites), the <title level="m">Guide</title> made it a permanent part of
                 the tourist literature and encouraged readers to imagine and undertake their own mountain ascents.</p>
                  <p>Just as importantly, William’s <title level="m">Guide</title> provided material that would be recycled by other travel writers. Numerous Lakeland guidebooks 
                 of the Victorian era, including Harriet Martineau’s famous <title level="m">Complete Guide</title> (fig.5.5), lingered on the <title level="m">Guide</title>’s
                 description of climbing Scafell hike. Normally, writers attributed the description to William, if they attributed it at all, but in doing so they enshrined 
                 Dorothy’s descriptive language and itinerary.<note place="foot" resp="editors">At times, DW’s text was (mis-)cited with comical results. Consider Henry S. 
                 Salt’s <title level="m">On Cambrian and Cumbrian Hills: Pilgrimages to Snowdon and Scawfell</title> (1908). Salt praises certain descriptions by poets 
                 like WW and Walter Scott but gripes that “on the whole . . . the poets have written about mountains as if they had never set foot on them, but had 
                 been content to take the panoramic ‘views’ of them from afar” (46). As evidence, he cites WW’s <title level="m">Guide</title>: “Even
                 Wordsworth’s prose account of his ascent from Seathwaite ‘to the top of the ridge, called Ash Course,’ makes one suspect that his real acquaintance
                 with the hills was very slight; indeed his corruption of the guide’s pronunciation of ‘Esk Hause’ . . . into the absurdity of ‘Ash Course,’
                 shows that he had but little sympathetic knowledge either of the nomenclature of the hills or of the dialect of the hillmen” (46). This sort of thing can 
                 happen when you publish your sister’s work as your own; by compressing her account, you make it less nuanced. DW mentions that “Ash Course” must be 
                 a corruption of “Esk Hause” and even provides the etymology for <hi rend="italic">Hause</hi>, the normal word for a mountain saddle in the region. 
                 WW’s <title level="m">Guide</title> cuts out her chatty and interesting explanation, leaving Salt, the latter-day man of the mountains, to conclude that the 
                 poet was ignorant.</note>

                    from [the peak], the best service to the stranger is still to copy portions of that
                    ‘Letter to a friend’ which Mr. Wordsworth published many years ago, and which is the
                    best account we have of the greatest mountain excursion in England” (138).

                  <p>The transmission process continued across many decades, as Dorothy’s (unacknowledged) observations were reprinted, quoted, and remembered by authors of various publications. 
               Their influence reverberated even as far as Wainwright, the patron saint of latter-day Lakeland fell-walkers, who offered his own endorsement of Dorothy’s path in 1960: 
               “Of the many routes of approach to Scafell Pike,” he wrote, “this, from Borrowdale via Esk Hause, is the finest.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Wainwright,
               <title level="m">Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells</title>, 4: Scafell Pike 18.</note> A few pages earlier, he specifically recommended the loop Dorothy and her friends 
               followed—ascent via Grains Gill, descent via Sty Head. He might have done this coincidentally, but probably not; he knew 
               Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide</title>.</p>
                  <p>Hardwicke Rawnsley, writing in <title level="m">Literary Associations of the English Lakes</title> (1894), captured both the reach and the essential irony of the reception 
               history of Dorothy’s <title level="a">Excursion.</title> Having quoted approvingly from the Scafell Pike section of the <title level="m">Guide</title> and smiled over its 
               observation (by then quaint) that few travelers summit that mountain, he concluded, “It may well be that never shall we witness such storm-grandeur as it was 
               Wordsworth’s lot to witness when, having climbed hither on a still autumn day, he was bade by his shepherd guide not to linger, for a storm was coming.”
               <note place="foot" resp="editors">Rawnsley, <title level="m">Literary Associations of the English Lakes</title>, 1:159–60.</note> Of course, 
               <hi rend="italic">William</hi> Wordsworth never did witness that storm-grandeur—in fact, he never climbed Scafell Pike at all, so far as records can tell. Rawnsley,
               like many others, assumed that he had, and his aim was to emphasize that modern pilgrims might stand where the poet had stood. After all, as Rawnsley said, “the 
               wanderer up Borrowdale and the mountains in its vicinity” will always “move” in “the company of chosen spirits.” But which spirits? In the 
               minds of many, the company has always worn trousers, but we hope our edition helps readers correctly imagine skirts and bonnets in the party.</p>

                  <p>Although De Sélincourt categorized Dorothy’s Scafell Pike account with her journals, it is not a diary entry per se. This genre question deserves consideration, for 
               some of the text’s character depends on its material forms, its circulation, and its audiences.</p>
                  <p>In conception, Dorothy’s account emerged from a cluster of letters—including, we presume, the lost one she wrote to Sara Hutchinson on top of the mountain. 
               The earliest surviving record of her ascent is her letter to Jane Marshall, dated 14 October 1818, which reads like a seed draft for the expanded report she would
               pen a week later. Dorothy expresses continued admiration for William Wilberforce (“There never lived on earth, I am sure, a man of sweeter temper”) 
               and recaps the lively 6 October dinner at Rosthwaite. “The next day,” she continues, “which was one of the finest of the year, I ascended Scaw
               Fell from Seathwaite with Miss Barker—and never before did I behold so sublime a mountain prospect.” Grateful for the weather they enjoyed, she 
               reports, “Our Guide, who is a Shepherd of Borrowdale, turning his eyes thoughtfully round when we were on the pinnacle of Scaw Fell, said ‘I do not 
               know that ever in the whole course of my life, I was at any season so high upon the mountains on so calm a day.’ There was not a breath of wind to stir the
               very papers which we spread out with our food, when we ate our dinners on that commanding eminence.” Some of this language would reappear almost verbatim 
               in Dorothy’s final treatment of the subject.</p>
                  <p>The experience of climbing the mountain obviously remained vivid in Dorothy’s mind. Eager to share it at length, she wrote on 21 October to the Reverend William Johnson,
               former curate and schoolmaster in Grasmere (1811–1812), who had since taken up an important teaching post in London. The original of her letter has been lost. 
               Fortunately, two copies survive, and these are our manuscript authorities for <title level="a">Excursion up Scawfell Pike.</title>
                  </p>
                  <p>The most complete extant manuscript is Dorothy’s own backup copy: as noted previously, she transcribed her letter to Johnson into a hand-sewn notebook, which is now
               catalogued as Dove Cottage Manuscript (DCMS) 51 (fig. 5.6). Similar to DCMS 120, which preserves Dorothy’s 
             <ref target="/editions.DW.editions.2023.DW.Poems-intro.html">poetry</ref>, DCMS 51 collects literary efforts that she valued.
               <title level="a">Excursion up Scawfell Pike</title> is its final item (fig. 5.7). It features both Dorothy’s edits in ink and various pencil marks, possibly
               by William, which move the text in the direction of his <title level="m">Guide</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Some of the pencil marks on DCMS 51 
               are literal scribbles—cancellations, insertion marks, and the like—while others suggest verbal revisions. It is difficult to determine who made
               the marks or when, though many of them do advance reshaping for the <title level="m">Guide</title> project, and it is likely that there are multiple layers.
               Possibly DW herself undertook adjustments at WW’s request, so we have to take care when assigning intention and responsibility.</note> Besides the obvious 
               merit of being written in Dorothy’s own hand, this manuscript also includes two important notes at the bottom of the last page: “October 21st 1818” 
               (confirming the composition date of the Johnson letter) and “Went up Scaw Fell on Wednesday the 7th October-1818.”</p>

                  <p>The second surviving manuscript, described hereafter as the Kenyon Transcript, is written in an attractive, unknown hand on 
              paper watermarked 1817 (fig. 5.8). At once a letter in its own right (addressed to “Miss Hutchinson” in Wales) but otherwise 
              businesslike, with no conventional gestures of greeting or conclusion, it is actually an incomplete copy of Dorothy’s letter to Johnson. It 
              is dated “October, 1818” and bracketed entirely within quotation marks. It begins, “I must inform you of a feat that Miss 
              Barker and I performed on Wednesday the 7th of this month.” In short, it omits material that takes up more than a page of Dorothy’s 
              notebook version, including her introduction of Mary Barker and her description of the dinner at Barker’s home. As Simon Bainbridge summarizes, 
              it “edits out the first part of the original letter to focus on the ascent narrative.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Bainbridge, <title level="m">Mountaineering and British Romanticism</title>, 239.</note>

                  <p>While DCMS 51 is longer and arguably more authoritative than the Kenyon Transcript, much of its final page has been torn out and lost 
             (fig. 5.9). Therefore, at least for the closing section of Dorothy’s account, the Kenyon Transcript is essential.</p>

                  <p>Furthermore, the Kenyon Transcript may match the original Johnson letter more closely than the DCMS 51 copy in some respects. We suggest this because 
             DCMS 51 shows edits for style and economy that the Kenyon Transcript does not include. Derived directly from the Johnson letter (or from yet another 
             copy that has not survived), the Kenyon Transcript likely retains many original readings, despite errors in copying. Additionally, the transcript 
             includes a final paragraph that Dorothy omits in DCMS 51: “I believe that you are not much acquainted with the Scenery of this Country, except
             in the Neighbourhood of Grasmere, your duties when you were a resident here, having confined you so much to that one Vale; I hope, however, that my 
             long Story will not be very dull; and even I am not without a further hope, that it may awaken in you a desire to spend a long holiday among the Mountains,
             and explore their recesses.” No doubt this invitation was part of the original letter to Johnson, but Dorothy saw no reason to copy it for her own
             records.</p>
                  <p>The Kenyon Transcript complicates the view that Dorothy’s text was never published except as part of William’s <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title>. 
             True, <title level="a">Excursion up Scawfell Pike</title> was never <hi rend="italic">printed</hi> as Dorothy’s during her lifetime, but it seems to have 
             enjoyed a lively public (or at least semipublic) existence in handwritten forms, moving among family, friends, and associates.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> 
             Considering <title level="a">Excursion Up Scafell Pike</title> as a manuscript publication naturally prompts us to ask if still more copies were made. This 
             question may be unanswerable. However, minor variants in De Sélincourt’s edition (<title level="m">DWJ</title>) that reflect neither DCMS 51 nor the Kenyon 
             Transcript suggest that an additional copy, now lost, might have been available to him. Owen and Smyser speculate on this point 
             (<title level="m">Prose</title> 2:367). Unfortunately, De Sélincourt says nothing about his manuscript sources.</note> Dorothy did write for an audience. 
             By revealing some of her circuits of communication, the Kenyon Transcript helps us guess at the significance of <title level="a">Excursion</title> for both its 
             writer and her friends and admirers. For more on the Kenyon Transcript, please see the appendix to our

                     <anchor xml:id="In-addition"/>In addition to the missing Johnson letter, the lost letters Dorothy and Mary Barker wrote to Sara Hutchinson from Scafell Pike would surely round out our understanding
             of 7 October 1818. Did these summit posts recall another famous “Scawfell letter,” written to the same Sara by Samuel Taylor Coleridge 16 years before on 
             the neighboring peak?<note place="foot" resp="editors">STC’s exuberant journal-letter to SH has become a classic of mountain literature. He is often said to have been
             the first nonlocal to climb Scafell and also, accidentally, England’s first rock climber, as he got himself in a tight pinch while descending. From 5 August 1802,
             we have this self-dramatizing passage: “On a nice Stone Table am I now at this moment writing to you—between 2 and 3 o’clock as I guess, surely the first
             Letter ever written from the Top of Sca’ Fell!” He adds, “You shall call this Letter when it passes before you the Sca’Fell Letter.” See Griggs, 
             <title level="m">Collected Letters</title>, 2:834–51. As Bainbridge notes, STC’s letter would be for the Wordsworth circle the “best-known of all 
             descriptions of mountain peril” (235).</note> We can only speculate, but it is not hard to imagine Dorothy recalling Coleridge’s exploit. Her “gift
             for drawing into the present all the wealth of past memories” surely applies to this text as it does to others.<note place="foot" resp="editors">This description
             of DW’s tendency to saturate present experience with memory comes from <title level="m">DWB</title>, 151.</note> If the missing on-the-spot letters ever surface, 
             we may have more details to enrich our story and help us better understand why the Kenyon Transcript was mailed to “Miss Hutchinson.”</p>

                  <p>Our <ref target="/editions.DW.editions.2023.DW.SP-reading.html">annotated and illustrated reading text</ref> is based primarily on DCMS 51, with minor emendations indicated in notes
             and the shift to the Kenyon Transcript (where DCMS 51 is torn) clearly indicated. Our emendations reflect the fact that certain conventions that today’s readers
             take for granted were not fully standardized in the early nineteenth century. Like other editors of Romantic-era writing, we have tried to balance reading convenience
             with preserving our text’s historical character.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Our approach largely corresponds with that of William Knight, who wrote in his preface
             to <title level="m">Letters of the Wordsworth Family</title> (1907), “I have not retained the punctuation adopted by Wordsworth—sometimes there was
             none—nor the capital letters, which were both numerous, and very arbitrary. . . .It might have been interesting, from a linguistic point of view, to preserve
             all the archaisms of spelling and punctuation (even when the dashes took the place alike of semicolons, colons, and periods); but the Wordsworth family were so 
             arbitrary and casual in their letter-writing—and even careless at times—that it would have been unjust to them, as well as disturbing to their readers,
             to have done so” (1:xi).</note> Insofar as possible, we preserve Dorothy’s paragraphing, though her indentations vary and her intentions can be hard to discern.
             Dorothy’s underlined words are set in italics. Her ampersands are converted to <hi rend="italic">and</hi>, and her occasional abbreviations are expanded—for 
             example, “Sir G. and &amp; Lady B.” to “Sir George and Lady Beaumont.” Capitalization is largely standardized, though we retain some instances
             in which Dorothy seems to capitalize common nouns for emphasis. We also retain Dorothy’s spelling.</p>
                  <p>Admittedly, any regularization may obscure important ambiguities or idiosyncrasies in the text. Some readers may wish to consult the original manuscripts to study
             Dorothy’s frequent and varied uses of dashes, as such marks either disappear in our reading text or appear uniformly as em dashes. Others may simply crave more 
             antiquarian flavor. Fortunately, our digital edition includes page images of the two manuscript sources [links] <!--where do I find these links?-->
             as well as <ref target="/editions.DW.editions.2023.DW.SP-A.html">diplomatic transcriptions</ref>, allowing readers to make their own judgments.
             In today’s “versioning” culture of editing, made convenient by technology, readers can generate their own ideal texts.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>Though based on DCMS 51, the version of <title level="a">Excursion</title> that appears in William’s 1822 <title level="m">Guide</title> simplifies Dorothy’s
            textual chronology and removes all dates, as if aiming to make the account timeless. It introduces various minor revisions.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
            The <title level="m">Guide</title> version changes “Scaw Fell” to “Scawfell Head,” presumably to better distinguish that eminence 
            from Scafell Pike; adds a passage (relocated from a different section of the <title level="m">Guide</title>) about “celestial” drinking water 
            on neighboring Great Gavel; inserts a comparison between the colors of Scafell Pike’s lichen-painted stones and “brilliant feathers”; and so 
            forth. However, these are minor features; the principal transformation comes from removing contextual framing and the participants’ names.</note> However, 
            the most obvious difference between Dorothy’s manuscript and the adaptation is the latter’s reduced length. William’s version includes approximately 1,205 words,
            whereas Dorothy’s original runs over 2,500. Unsurprisingly, Dorothy’s text is richer. The <title level="m">Guide</title>’s main editorial tendency is to make 
            Dorothy’s narrative less personal. In the manuscript, Dorothy begins by recording the visits of the Beaumonts and Wilberforces and by introducing Mary 
            Barker—that is, by assembling her cast of characters. All of this social context disappears in the <title level="m">Guide</title>. Thus, when the 
            <title level="m">Guide</title> reports, “Having left Rossthwaite [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] in Borrowdale . . . we ascended,” readers have 
            little sense of who “we” might be. In Dorothy’s manuscript, readers find friendship, personality, wonder, and humor, all shaping an expedition 
            organized by two intrepid women. In William’s abridgment, readers mainly encounter landscape visions that might be comparable with those afforded by the 
            Alps.<note place="foot" resp="editors">WW’s 1822 title page promises “illustrative remarks upon the Scenery of the Alps,” and his attempt to 
            “reconcile a Briton to the scenery of his own country” (120) has included an argument that, although the Lakeland fells cannot compare with 
            the Alps in absolute height and grandeur, they compare favorably in their proportions and combinations. Accordingly, WW introduces DW’s account in this 
            way: “The Reader may not however be displeased with the following extract from a letter to a Friend, giving an account of a visit to a summit of one 
            of the highest of these mountains; of which I am reminded by the observations of Mr. West, and by reviewing what has been said of this district in comparison
            with the Alps” (129–30). He has already quoted West saying that Britons who intend to tour the Continent should begin in the Lake District 
            “as it will give, in miniature, an idea of what they are to meet with there” (128). He and DW had recently undertaken this sort of comparison,
            exploring the Alps during their 1820 Continental tour.</note> After reading William’s version, one knows nothing of the occasion that prompted the mountain
            walk and finds no sign that any women were involved.</p>
                  <p>What might Dorothy’s feelings have been about supplying this text for William’s <title level="m">Guide</title>? We have a few key facts to consider. First, 
            Dorothy was part of the project from the start. Back at the time of <title level="m">Select Views</title> (1810), the first version of what became the 
            <title level="m">Guide</title>, William asked Dorothy to finish some of the writing when the work became “irksome” to him.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
            Letter to Catherine Clarkson, 12 November 1810 (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:449).</note> Meanwhile, Dorothy opined that William might repurpose 
            <title level="m">Select Views</title>, create his own guide to the Lake District, and find the product more lucrative than his “higher [poetic] 
            labours.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Letter to Catherine Clarkson, 18 November 1809 (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 2:372).</note> William 
            eventually took her advice by including <title level="m">Select Views</title> material in his 1820 <title level="m">River Duddon</title> volume. This experiment
            resulted in encouraging sales and reviews, so issuing a stand-alone guidebook seemed like a logical next step. However, for this purpose, William likely sensed 
            that his text needed some padding out.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In <title level="m">The River Duddon</title>, the <title level="a">Topographical Description
            of the Country of the Lakes in the North of England</title> ran to approximately 108 pages (213–321), or about a third of the total volume and some 40 
            percent of the total word count. The 1822 <title level="m">Guide</title> added ten thousand words and came to 156 pages.</note> Happily, he had promising material
            on hand in the form of Dorothy’s notebook and its copy of the Scafell Pike letter. Dorothy was fond of this autobiographical piece, which she had bound with other 
            specimens of her best work (DCMS 51). She was probably willing—perhaps even pleased—to see it in print, even if it would appear in truncated form. Perhaps
            William transformed it for his own ends, but we should keep in mind the likelihood that Dorothy wanted him to use it and even preferred that he remove personal 
            details about her and her friends. Indeed, she may have assisted with the edits.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Compare revisions DW made to 
            <title level="m">Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland, A.D. 1803</title> described well in <title level="m">DWB</title>, 411–12) when preparing a copy
                for possible publication; also, consider her rationale for refusing to print her <title level="a">

                        </title> discussed elsewhere in this edition. Tact and privacy were important to her.</note> The 
            <title level="m">Guide</title> was an important effort in favor of the family economy, and Dorothy supported this endeavor as she had so many others.</p>
                  <p>Readers must decide for themselves about the ethics of William’s borrowing, an issue that has been addressed repeatedly in studies of the Wordsworths 
            but perhaps not sufficiently with respect to <title level="a">Excursion up Scawfell Pike.</title> This instance of appropriation seems unique in scale 
            and significance, as William tacitly takes credit not only for Dorothy’s writing but also for her physical accomplishment. Might it not have been a 
            simple matter for William to describe the account as “an extract from <hi rend="italic">my sister’s</hi> letter to a friend”? Nonetheless, 
            we have no evidence that Dorothy objected to his editorial sleight of hand. Lucy Newlyn’s observation, offered in a different context, may apply in this 
            situation: “Dorothy’s preference was always for an anonymous role in their collaboration, but this need not be read as a sign that she believed 
            herself inferior. . . . Her labour was not alienated, and she knew her gifts to be greatly valued.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Newlyn, 238.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In any case, the <title level="m">Guide</title>’s incorporation of Dorothy’s Scafell Pike ascent must have been thought a success by all concerned. 
           The 1822 <title level="m">Guide</title> sold well, and then, in the 1823 edition, another gem from Dorothy’s notebook (DCMS 51) was added: her account 
           of an 1805 walking tour around <ref target="/editions.DW.editions.2023.DW.Ulls-intro.html">Ullswater</ref>. This meant <!--anchor to Ulls intro!-->
           that Dorothy’s presence in the <title level="m">Guide</title> grew as the project evolved. We do not know precisely how many words she contributed 
           in 1810 or 1820,<note place="foot" resp="editors">For conjectures on this point, see <title level="m">Prose</title> 2:126, 143. One substantial 1810 
           passage Owen and Smyser conclude to be DW’s, written in her hand, comes to 452 words. Unfortunately, handwriting in the 
           surviving <title level="m">Guide</title> manuscripts is no sure evidence of authorship, since DW, WW, MW, and SH all took turns 
           writing.</note> but in 1822, she generated at least 1,200 words out of the total 29,800 (about 4 percent), and in 1823, at least 4,446 words 
           of 35,300 (13 percent). The placement of her offerings was also important, since her two “excursions” became the final, climactic section 
           of the book.<note place="foot" resp="editors">As Mary Ellen Bellanca argues, DW’s writing reached readers mostly “by means of William’s poetic 
           reputation and in context ancillary to it,” but it <hi rend="italic">did</hi> find readers, and indeed it “helped to <hi rend="italic">make</hi> 
           [WW’s] reputation”; therefore, “it is well past time to discard the notion of Dorothy Wordsworth as an 
           unpublished, or only posthumously published, writer” (<title level="m">Daybooks</title>, 138). Along this line, it is noteworthy that 
           enthusiastic readers of the <title level="m">Guide</title> often singled out DW’s contributions. See, or instance, one of the earliest reviews, 
           which quoted the Scafell Pike narrative at length (<title level="a">Wordsworth’s Scenery of the Lakes,</title> 494–95).</note>

                  <p>For over a century, the survival of Dorothy’s <title level="a">Excursion</title> in print depended on the popularity of 
            William’s <title level="m">Guide</title>. William Angus Knight did not include it in his 1897 edition of Dorothy’s journals or his 
            1907 <title level="m">Letters of the Wordsworth Family</title>. Consequently, as noted previously, its full public introduction had to 
            wait for the appearance of De Sélincourt’s 1941 <title level="m">Journals</title> (vol. 1).<note place="foot" resp="editors">De Sélincourt 
            had not included the text in his (first) edition of WW and DW’s correspondence, published 1935–39, possibly because the original 
            letter was missing. However, he did include the related letter to Jane Marshall and mention in a footnote that DW’s account of climbing 
            Scafell Pike could be found (revised) in WW’s <title level="m">Guide</title>.</note> De Sélincourt’s edition, with its brief but 
            valuable introduction, remained the standard for years.</p>
                  <p>In 1970, the text appeared in the revised Oxford <title level="m">Letters of William and Dorothy Wordsworth</title> (vol. 3, 
            <title level="m">Middle Years II</title>, 1812–1820). This resource correctly reframed the text as a letter 
            (<title level="a">D. W. to William Johnson</title>); however, some information it provided was misleading. The editors of that volume, 
            Mary Moorman and Alan G. Hill, cited as their manuscript authority “<hi rend="italic">WL transcript [possibly in John Carter’s hand]</hi>.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <title level="m">Letters</title>, 3:499.</note> Either that 
            document has been lost or, more likely, the editors meant to describe what our edition calls the Kenyon Transcript, which is definitely 
            not in John Carter’s hand. Moreover, the editors did not faithfully follow that source. Instead, they largely adopted De Sélincourt’s text 
            from <title level="m">Journals</title>, though they did add one sentence, Dorothy’s final invitation to come explore the mountains.</p>
                  <p>A few years later, W. J. B. Owen and Jane Worthington Smyser provided a more reliable and thoroughly annotated version of the Scafell Pike 
            <title level="a">Excursion</title> as an appendix to <title level="m">The Prose Works of William Wordsworth</title>, vol. 2 (1974), aiming to
            illuminate the origins of the <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title>. Unfortunately, <title level="m">Prose Works</title> is out of print,
            expensive to purchase on the used market, and available mainly in research libraries. It remains an essential source for scholars aiming to 
            trace textual variants; however, it is neither easily obtained nor especially friendly for the general reader, and it places Dorothy Wordsworth
            in a secondary role.</p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="a">Excursion up Scawfell Pike</title> was occasionally mentioned in scholarship of the 1980s and 90s; for instance, Susan M. Levin
           discussed it in her <title level="m">Dorothy Wordsworth and Romanticism</title> (1987). Surprisingly, however, Levin chose to omit it from her 
           own anthology, <title level="m">Dorothy Wordsworth, A Longman Cultural Edition</title> (2009). Susan Wolfson chose in 1999 to include most of 
           Dorothy’s <title level="a">Excursion</title> in <title level="m">The Longman Anthology of British Literature</title>, making the text available 
           to student readers for the first time.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The text appeared in all five editions of the <title level="m">Longman 
           Anthology of British Literature</title> (1999 forward), specifically in <title level="m">Volume 2A, The Romantics and Their Contemporaries</title>,
           coedited by Susan Wolfson and Peter Manning. Wolfson has been one of the text’s most prominent recent champions. See also her 
           <title level="a">Two Wordsworths,</title> 61–82.</note> A few respected critics have discussed the text more recently. Still, it seems safe 
           to say that the text remains an underappreciated part of Dorothy’s oeuvre. We trust that this digital edition makes <title level="a">Excursion up 
           Scawfell Pike</title> available to a broader audience while also providing a vital and up-to-date resource to scholars.</p>

               <p>Sir George and Lady Beaumont spent a few days with us lately, and I accompanied them
                to Keswick. Mr. and Mrs. Wilberforce and their family happened to be at Keswick at
                the same time, and we all dined together in the romantic Vale of Borrowdale, at the
                house of a female friend, Miss Barker, an unmarried lady, who, bewitched with the
                charms of the rocks, and streams, and mountains of that secluded spot, has there
                built herself a house,<note place="foot" resp="editors">To be precise, Mary Barker’s
                home was in Rosthwaite. Green, in his <title level="m">Tourist’s New Guide</title> (1819),
                mentions the new structure and its surroundings: “On the banks of the Stonethwaite
                arm of the Derwent, there has recently been erected, by Miss Barker, an excellent house,
                commanding a fine view over the river, and of the rocky elevations, called Hay Stacks.
                There is scarcely amongst these northern vallies, a place, in which an equally valuable
                collection of painters’ studies may be so speedily collected” (2:136).</note>

               <p>You will guess that she has resources within herself; such indeed she has. She is a
                painter and labours hard in depicting the beauties of her favourite vale; she is
                also fond of music and of reading; and has a reflecting mind: besides (though before
                she lived in Borrowdale she was no great walker) she is become an active climber of

                opting for a more economical expression. The Kenyon Transcript retains “to
                me” and other words crossed out in DCMS 51, suggesting that it was copied
                directly from the original letter to Johnson or else from an early copy that has

                which the people are accustomed to pass between Eskdale and Borrowdale; and such
                settlings are generally called by the name of “the Hawes”—as 
                Grisedale Hawes, Buttermere Hawes—from the German word Hals (neck).

                probably right to assume that local pronunciation has drifted somewhat. 
                The usual spelling of “Ash Course” today is “Esk Hause.”

               <p>We found ourselves at the top of Ash Course without a weary limb, having had the
                fresh air of autumn to help us up by its invigorating power, and the sweet warmth of
                the unclouded sun to tempt us to sit and rest by the way. From the top of Ash Course
                we beheld a prospect which would indeed have amply repaid me<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                me with fresh chearfulness, added a delight, a charm to the contemplation of the magnificent

               <p>Three views, each distinct in its kind, we saw at once: the vale of Borrowdale, of
                Keswick, of Bassenthwaite—Skiddaw, Saddleback, Helvellyn, numerous other mountains,
                and, still beyond, the Solway Frith,<note place="foot" resp="editors">The Solway Firth,
                an inlet of the Irish Sea, forms part of the border between North West England and 
                South West Scotland. “Firth” has solidified as the standard form, but in DW’s time,
                “firth” and “frith” were interchangeable.</note> 
                and the Mountains of Scotland. Nearer to us on the other side, and below us, were
                the Langdale Pikes—their own Vale below <hi rend="italic">them</hi>, Windermere—and,
                far beyond, after a long long distance, Ingleborough in Yorkshire. But how shall I
                speak of the peculiar deliciousness of the third prospect! At this time <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was most favoured by sunshine and shade. The green Vale
                of Esk—deep and green, with its glittering serpent stream was below us; and on we
                looked to the mountains near the sea—Black Comb and others—and still beyond, 
                to the sea itself in dazzling brightness.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Here in 
                DCMS 51, DW has deleted “At this same station, (making as it might be called 
                a 4th division or prospect).” The Kenyon Transcript retains the orientation 
                gesture with slight variation: “At this same Station making what may be called
                a 4th Division, turning round, we saw the mountains of Wasdale.”</note> 
                Turning round we saw the mountains of Wasdale in tumult; and Great Gavel, though the
                middle of the mountain was to us as its base, looked very grand.</p>
               <p>We had attained the object of our journey; but our ambition mounted higher. We saw
                the summit of Scaw Fell, as it seemed, very near to us: we were indeed, three parts
                up that mountain; and thither we determined to go. We found the distance greater
                than it had appeared to us; but our courage did not fail; however, when we came
                nearer we perceived that, in order to attain that summit, we must make a great
                dip,<note place="foot" resp="editors">The walkers showed wisdom in not attempting 
                this traverse via the col of Mickledore, a “dip” of some 454 feet. 
                The narrow ridge is difficult and potentially dangerous for non-experts. Wainwright
                writes colorfully in his <title level="m">Pictorial Guide</title>, “Medals 
                have been won for lesser deeds. This is a walk not to be undertaken lightly, and 
                not at all if time is short or if limbs are already tired” (4: Scafell Pike, 29). 
                </note> and that the ascent afterwards would be exceedingly steep and difficult, 
                so that we might have been benighted if we had attempted it; therefore, unwillingly,
                we gave it up, and resolved, instead, to ascend another point of the same mountain, 
                called <hi rend="italic">the Pikes</hi>, and which, I have since found, the measurers
                of mountains estimate as higher than the larger summit which bears the name of Scaw
                Fell,<note place="foot" resp="editors">In the <title level="m">Guide</title>, WW gives
                “Scaw Fell Head” rather than “Scaw Fell,” presumably to

                which we, at the time, considered as the point of highest honour.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">The “Stone Man” is a pile of stones that
                marks the summit. DW is correct in her account of the altitude. People long considered
                Scafell (3,163 ft.) the highest peak on the massif, but “the measurers of 
                mountains” (beginning with Joseph Banks’s Trigonometrical Survey team in 1790) 
                concluded that Scafell Pike (3,209 ft.) was in fact higher. Early nineteenth-century 
                maps depict this little-explored neighborhood without much detail; indeed, some show 
                no mountains at all. However, both Jonathan Otley’s map of 1818 and Sidney Hall’s map 
                for WW’s 1822 <title level="m">Guide</title> make the distinction between Scawfell 
                and the Scawfell Pike or Pikes. Today, Scafell Pike, Ill Crag, and Broad Crag are 
                often designated collectively as the “Pikes of Scafell.”</note>

               <p>—The Sun had never once been overshadowed by a cloud during the whole of our progress
                from the centre of Borrowdale; at the summit of the Pike there was not a breath of
                air to stir even the papers which we spread out containing our food. There we ate
                our dinner in summer warmth; and the stillness seemed to be not of this world. — We
                paused, and kept silence to listen, and not a sound of any kind was to be heard. — 
                We were far above the reach of the cataracts of Scaw Fell; and not an insect was
                there to hum the air. The vales before described lay in view; and, side by side with
                Eskdale, we now saw the sister Vale of Donnerdale terminated by the Duddon Sands.
                But the majesty of the mountains below and close to us, is not to be conceived. We
                now beheld the whole mass of Great Gavel from its base—the Den of Wasdale at our
                feet, the gulph immeasurable—Grassmire<note place="foot" resp="editors">De Sélincourt

               <p>While we were looking round after dinner our guide said to us that we must not linger
                long, for we should have a storm. We looked in vain to espy the traces of it; for
                mountains, vales, and sea were all touched with the clear light of the sun. “It is
                there,” he said, pointing to the sea beyond Whitehaven; and, sure enough, we there
                perceived a light cloud, or mist, unnoticeable but by a shepherd, accustomed to
                watch all mountain bodings.<note place="foot" resp="editors">DW seems to recall the 
                vigilant shepherd of WW’s <title level="m">Michael</title>: “And in his shepherd’s     <!--Do I need to put this within <poetry> tags?-->
                calling he was prompt / And watchful more than ordinary men. / Hence he had learned the
                meaning of all winds, / Of blasts of every tone” (lines 46–49). She may also echo
                STC’s <title level="m">The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere</title>: “I saw something
                in the Sky / No bigger than my fist; / At first it seem’d a little speck / And then it 
                seem’d a mist: / It mov’d and mov’d, and took at last / A certain shape I wist” 
                (Part III, stanza 1 in 1798 text). This same passage from <title level="m">Rime</title> 
                may influence DW’s description of cloud shapes as discussed in n22.</note>
                We gazed around again and yet again, fearful to lose the remembrance of what lay
                before us in that lofty solitude; and then prepared to depart. Meanwhile the air
                changed to cold, and we saw the tiny vapour swelled into mighty masses of cloud
                which came boiling over the mountains. Great Gavel, Helvellyn, and Skiddaw were
                wrapped in storm; yet Langdale, and the mountains in that quarter were all bright
                with sunshine. Soon the storm reached us; we sheltered under a crag;<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                Likely, “crag” candidates for the party’s shelter in place are in 
                Calf Cove, just below Ill Crag, as noted in the <ref target="https://arcg.is/1C01Lv">Story Map</ref>.</note> 
                and, almost as rapidly as it had come, it passed away, and left us free to observe
                the goings-on of storm and sunshine in other quarters.</p>
               <p>Langdale had now its share, and the Pikes were decorated by two splendid rainbows;
               Skiddaw also had its own rainbows, but we were truly glad to see <hi rend="italic">them</hi> and the clouds disappear from <hi rend="italic">that mountain</hi>,

               that very time—and so it was. They were there, and had much more rain than
               we had; we, indeed, were hardly at all wetted; and before we found ourselves 
               again upon that part of the mountain called Ash Course every cloud had vanished
               from every summit.</p>
               <p>Do not think we here gave up our spirit of enterprise. No! I had heard much of the
                grandeur of the view of Wasdale from Stye Head, the point from which Wasdale is
                first seen in coming by the road from Borrowdale; but though I had been in Wasdale I
                had never entered the dale by that road, and had often lamented that I had not seen
                what was so much talked of by travellers.</p>

               <p>Before we reached Seathwaite<note place="foot" resp="editors">“Seathwaite” is an 
               emendation. DCMS 51 is difficult to read here but appears to have “Stonethwaite” 
               rather than “Seathwaite.” The Kenyon Transcript clearly has “Stonethwaite,”
               suggesting that the slip was part of DW’s original letter. Previous editors have retained it.
               Nonetheless, as in the earlier instance (see n6), “Stonethwaite” is certainly a
               mistake. The walkers would end their descent from Sty Head at Seathwaite, where they would 
               retrieve their cart. From that place, they would take the 2.5-mile road back to Mary Barker’s
               home in Rosthwaite, passing the turn to nearby Stonethwaite but not taking it. It is true 
               that Rosthwaite is situated on the Stonethwaite arm of the River Derwent and that the toponyms
               resemble each other, so some confusion was understandable. WW, in the <title level="m">Guide</title>,
               correctly has “Seathwaite” in this position.</note> a few stars had appeared,
               and we travelled home in our cart by moonlight.</p>
               <p>I ought to have described the last part of our ascent to Scaw Fell Pike. There, not a
                blade of grass was to be seen—hardly a cushion of moss, and that was parched and
                brown; and only growing rarely between the huge blocks and stones which cover the
                summit and lie in heaps all round to a great distance, like skeletons or bones of
                the earth not wanted at the creation, and there left to be covered with never-dying
                lichens, which the clouds and dews nourish; and adorn with colours of the most vivid
                and exquisite beauty, and endless in variety.</p>

               <p>No gems or flowers can surpass in colouring the beauty of some of these masses of
                stone, which no human eye beholds, except the shepherd is led thither by chance or
                the traveller by curiosity; and how seldom must this happen! The other eminence<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                The “other eminence” is neighboring Scafell, which DW mentions earlier as the supposed
                “point of highest honour.” She may have a particular “adventurous traveller” 
                in mind: STC, who made a pioneering ascent of Scafell in 1802.</note> is that which is 
                visited by the adventurous traveller, and the <hi rend="italic">shepherd</hi> has no 
                temptation to go thither in quest of his sheep; for on the <hi rend="italic">Pike</hi>
                there is no food to tempt them.</p>
               <p>We certainly were singularly fortunate in the day; for when we were seated on the
                summit our Guide, turning his eyes thoughtfully round, said to us, “I do not know
                that in my whole life I was ever at any season of the year so high up on the
                mountains on so calm a day.” Afterwards, you know, we had the storm which exhibited
                to us the grandeur of earth and heaven commingled, yet without terror; for we knew
                that the storm would pass away; for so our prophetic Guide assured us. I forgot to
                tell you that I espied a ship upon the glittering sea while we were looking over Esk
                dale. “Is it a ship?” replied the Guide. “A ship! yes it can be nothing else, don’t
                you see the shape of it?” Miss Barker interposed, “It is a ship,<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                At this point (after “ship” and an indecipherable cancellation), DCMS 51 has
                a gap: more than half of the final page is missing, torn away. Our reading text therefore
                depends mainly on the Kenyon Transcript from here to the close. Note that our text differs
                in small details from those given in <title level="m">Letters</title> and <title level="m">DWJ</title>.
                The following fragments are legible on the final page of DCMS 51: “[?] to / of / 
                our / -mon performances o / -ker &amp; I each wrote a [?] / top of the Pike of Scaw Fell /
                -distant Friend, Sara Hutchin / South Wales. / October 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> 1818 / 
                Went up Scaw Fell on Wednesday the / 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> October—1818.”</note> 
                of that I am certain—I cannot be mistaken, I am so accustomed to the appearance of
                ships at sea.” The Guide dropped the argument; but a minute was scarcely gone when
                he quietly said, “Now look at your ship, it is now a horse.” So indeed it was, with
                a gallant neck and head. We laughed heartily, and I hope when I am again inclined to
                positiveness I may remember the ship and the horse upon the glittering sea; and the
                calm confidence, yet submission of our wise Man of the Mountains, who certainly had
                more knowledge of <hi rend="italic">clouds</hi> than we, whatever might be our
                knowledge of <hi rend="italic">ships</hi>.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Readers may
                detect various echoes (possibly tongue-in-cheek) in this memorable passage on clouds, 
                prophetic guides, and the limits of perception. See, for instance, the exchange between
                Elijah and Ahab at the end of 1 Kings 18 (“there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea,
                like a man’s hand”); or, for a playful contrast, the exchange between Hamlet and Polonius
                on clouds as camels, weasels, or whales in <title level="m">Hamlet</title> III.2. In any case, 
                “That which is now a horse, even with a thought / The rack dislimns, and makes it 
                indistinct / As water is in water” (<title level="m">Antony and Cleopatra</title>
                     <!--Do I need to use <quote> tags here, or is it good as-is?-->
                IV.14.11–13). Compare also the cloud passage from Coleridge’s <title level="m">Rime</title>
                cited in n15.</note> —To add to our uncommon performances on this day Miss Barker
                and I each wrote a letter from the top of the Pike to our far distant friend in
                South Wales—Sara Hutchinson.<note place="foot" resp="editors">These letters from 
                the summit are unfortunately lost.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I believe that you are not much acquainted with the Scenery of this Country, except
                in the Neighbourhood of Grasmere, your duties when you were a resident here, having
                confined you so much to that one Vale; I hope, however, that my long Story will not
                be very dull; and even I am not without a further hope, that it may awaken in you a
                desire to spend a long holiday among the Mountains, and explore their recesses.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">This final paragraph, really a postscript, appears
                only in the Kenyon Transcript, suggesting that it appeared in the original Johnson 
                letter but that DW felt no need to copy it into her notebook.</note>

                  <hi rend="bold">[Editor’s note:</hi> The 13-page account of Dorothy Wordsworth’s <title level="a">Scawfell Excursion</title> in DCMS 51 features edits
                        in both pen and pencil. Previous editors have assumed that the pencil marks are William Wordsworth’s, noting that many of these 
                        changes appeared in the version published in the third edition of his <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> (1823).
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors">Owen and Smyser, for instance, write, “It is usually easy to discriminate between 
                        corrections made by Dorothy while she was in the process of making her own extract from her letter to Johnson and corrections
                        made a few years later when the 1822 <title level="m">Guide</title> was being prepared” (<title level="m">Prose</title>,
                        2:362). This is, as they say, “usually” true, but not always.</note> This theory is plausible; however, both William
                        and Dorothy appear to have undertaken multiple rounds of edits between 1818 and the text’s 1822 publication, and it is difficult to
                        tell which edits belong to which hand. The diplomatic transcription that follows therefore aims to include all markings, including
                        lines and symbols for deletions or insertions that are difficult to reproduce typographically. Unfortunately, the final page of DCMS
                        51 is badly torn. For the missing text, readers must consult a second manuscript source, which we refer to as the

                       what De Sélincourt offers in <title level="m">DWJ</title>. However, De Sélincourt’s editing procedure is mysterious. He appears to
                       use DCMS 51 as his base text, but if that is the case, he presumably depends on another manuscript for all of the material from 
                       “It is a Ship” to “our far distant friend in S. Wales, Miss Hutchinson”—text missing from the torn 
                       notebook page. He might turn to the Kenyon Transcript, but some of his readings differ slightly from that witness. For instance, 
                       he ends with “Miss Hutchinson” where the Kenyon Transcript has “Sara Hutchinson”; he has “I hope, 
                       when again inclined to positiveness, I may remember” where the Keynon Transcript has “I hope when I am again inclined
                       to positiveness, I may remember.” Finally, De Sélincourt has “submissiveness” where the Kenyon Transcript has 
                       “submission.” Are these mistakes? Silent emendations? Did De Sélincourt have access to a manuscript that has since 
                       been lost? Or, alternately, was the torn last page of DCMS 51 still intact when he did his work? Even that last circumstance would
                       not explain all the variants, as DCMS 51 clearly has “Sara Hutchinson” rather than “Miss Hutchinson.”</note>

                    The Kenyon Transcript reproduces, in an attractive but unknown hand, most of the letter Dorothy Wordsworth wrote for William Johnson
                    in late 1818. It is itself a letter, sent to “Miss Hutchinson” (probably Sara) in January 1819.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Note that the Kenyon Transcript is probably the later of the two
                    surviving manuscripts, as the DCMS 51 copy likely would have been made in November or at latest December 1818, before the original
                    Johnson letter was posted.</note> Though it omits introductory material that occupies more than a page in Dorothy’s own copy (DCMS 51);
                    it also supplies roughly 300 words missing from DCMS 51 because of a tear in that manuscript’s last page. The Kenyon Transcript differs 
                    from DCMS 51 in punctuation, orthography, and other details.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In many cases it is difficult to tell 
                    whether the scribe intends a lowercase or uppercase letter. Like all transcriptions, this one requires educated guesswork, 
                    notwithstanding the general clarity and attractiveness of the handwriting.</note> Certain spelling variations (e.g., “Seathwate,” 
                    “Scar Fell”) may be hearing errors rather than transcription errors; possibly the scribe worked from dictation. For particulars on
                    this document, reasons for calling it the “Kenyon Transcript,” and ongoing research concerning it, please see the section <ref target="#Appendix">appendix</ref>.</p>

                and proceeded with a man to carry our<lb/>

            We found ourselves at the top of Ash Course, without a weary<lb/>
            limb, having had the fresh Air of Autumn to help us up by its<lb/>
            invigorating effects, and the sweet Warmth of the unclouded<lb/>
            sun to tempt us to sit and rest by the way. – From the top<lb/>
            of Ash Course, I beheld a prospect which would indeed have<lb/>
            amply repaid Me for a <hi rend="underline">toilsome</hi> journey, if such it had been;<lb/>

            added a delight – a charm to the contemplation of the magnificent<lb/>
            views before me which I cannot describe – Still less can I tell<lb/>
            you the glories of what we saw. – Three Views each distinct<lb/>
            in its kind, we saw at once – the Vale of Borrowdale – of<lb/>
            Keswick, of Bassenthwaite, of Skiddow, of Saddleback, Helvellyn,<lb/>
            numerous other mountains – and still beyond – the Solway<lb/>
            Frith and the Mountains of Scotland – Nearer to us on the<lb/>
            otherside and below us, were the Langdale Pikes – their own<lb/>
            Vale below them, Windermere, and far beyond after a long<lb/>
            Long distance – We saw Ingleborough in Yorkshire – But how<lb/>
            shall I speak of the peculiar deliciousness of the third Prospect!<lb/>
            At this time that was most favoured by Sun shine and shade -<lb/>
            The green Vale of Esk – deep and green, with its glittering serpent<lb/>
            stream was below us, and on we looked to the mountains near<lb/>
            the Sea – Black Comb, and others and still beyond to the Sea itself<lb/>
            in dazzling brightness. – At this same Station making what may<lb/>
            be called a 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Division, turning round, we saw the mountains<lb/>
            of Wasdale in tumult, &amp; Great Gavel though the middle of the<lb/>
            mountain was to us as its base, looked very grand – We had<lb/>
            attained the object of our journey; but our ambition mounted<lb/>
            higher – We saw the summit of Scar Fell,
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">This spelling gives us a hint at pronunciation (compare “Scawfell,” “Sca Fell”) 
                    and gives yet another indication that the scribe may be working from dictation.</note>
                as it seemed, very<lb/>
            near to us – We were indeed three parts up that mountain &amp; thither<lb/>
            we determined to go, we found the distance greater than it had<lb/>
            appeared to us, but our Courage did not fail; however, when<lb/>
            we came nearer we perceived that in order to attain that<lb/>
            summit which had invited us forward – we must make<lb/>
            a great dip, and that the ascent afterwards would be<lb/>
            exceedingly steep and difficult, so that we might have been<lb/>
            benighted if we had attempted it, therefore unwillingly we gave<lb/>
            it up, and resolved, instead, to ascend another pike of the<lb/>
            same mountain, called the pikes and which I have since <span change="brown">[end p. 2 / 2v]</span>

                  <p>found the measurers of the mountains estimate as higher than the<lb/>
            larger summit which bears the name of Scaw Fell, and where<lb/>
            the man is built, which we at the time considered as the point<lb/>
            of highest honour. – The Sun had never once been overshadowed<lb/>
            by a Cloud during the whole of our progress from the Center of<lb/>
            Borrowdale; at the summit of the pike there was not a breath<lb/>
            of air to stir even the papers which we spread out containing<lb/>
            our food – There we ate our dinner in summer warmth – and<lb/>
            the stillness seemed to be not of this world – We paused &amp; kept<lb/>
            silence to listen and not a sound of any kind was to be heard<lb/>
            – We were far out of the reach of the Cataracts of Scaw Fell, &amp; not an<lb/>
            Insect was there to hum in the Air – The Vales which I have<lb/>
            before described lay in view; – &amp;, side by side with Eskdale,<lb/>
            we now saw the sister Vale of Donnerdale terminated by the Duddon<lb/>
            Sands - but the Majesty of the mountains below us and close to us<lb/>
            is not to be conceived – We now saw the whole mass of Great Gavel<lb/>
            from its base – the den of Wasdale, at our feet – the Gulph im-<lb/>
            -measurable – Grassmere and the other mountains of Crummock<lb/>
            –Ennerdale and its mountains – and the Sea beyond. – While we<lb/>
            were looking round after dinner our Guide said to us that we<lb/>
            must not linger long for we should have a storm – We looked<lb/>
            in vain to espy the traces of it – for mountains, Vales, and Sea were<lb/>
            all touched with the clear light of the Sun – “It is there,” – he said,<lb/>
            pointing to the Sea beyond Whitehaven, and, sure enough, we there<lb/>
            perceived a little Cloud or Mist, unnoticeable, but by a Shepherd<lb/>
            accustomed to watch all mountain bodings – We gazed all round<lb/>
            again, and yet again, fearful to lose the remembrance of what lay<lb/>
            before us in that lofty solitude, and then prepared to depart – Mean<lb/>
            -while the Air changed to cold, and we saw that tiny Vapour<lb/>
            swelled into mighty Masses of Cloud which came boiling over<lb/>
            the Mountains – Great Gavel, Helvellyn &amp; Skiddew

                    – Langdale had now its<lb/>
            share, and the Pikes were decorated by two splendid Rainbows<lb/>
            – Skidda also had its Rainbows; but we were truly glad to see<lb/>
            them and the clouds disappear from that mountain, as we knew<lb/>
            that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Wilberforce and all their family (if they kept the intention<lb/>
            which they had formed when we parted the Night before) must certainly<lb/>

                    at that very time, – and so it was – They were there<lb/>
            and had much more rain than we had – We indeed were hardly<lb/>
            at all wetted, and before we found ourselves again upon that part of<lb/>
            the mountain called Ash Course every Cloud had vanished from<lb/>
            every summit – Do not think we here gave up our Spirit<lb/>
            of Enterprize – No! I had heard much of the Grandeur of the Pass<lb/>
            of the Stye from Borrowdale to Wasdale, &amp; of the Grandeur of the<lb/>
            view of Wasdale from Stye head the point from which Wasdale<lb/>
            is first seen in coming by the road from Borrowdale but though<lb/>
            I had been in Wa<del rend="strike">r</del>sdale I had never entered the Dale by that road,<lb/>
            and had often lamented that I had not seen what was so much<lb/>
            talked of by Travellers. – Down to that Pass then (for we were<lb/>
            yet far above it) we bent our course by the side of Ruddle Gill<lb/>
            a very deep red chasm in the mountain, which begins at a<lb/>
            spring – that spring forms a stream which must at times be<lb/>
            a mighty Torrent, as is evident from the Channel which it has<lb/>
            wrought out thence by sprinkling Tarn to Stye-head and<lb/>
            there we sat and looked down into Wasdale. – We were now<lb/>
            upon Great Gavel, which rose high above us – opposite was<lb/>
            Scaw fell, and we heard the roaring of the stream from one of<lb/>
            the ravines of that mountain, which though the bending of Wasdale<lb/>
            head lay between us and Scaw Fell, we could look into, as it<lb/>
            were, and the depth of the ravine appeared tremendous – it<lb/>
            was black, and the Crags were awful – We now proceeded<lb/>
            homewards by Stye head Tarn along the road into Borrowdale<lb/>
            Before we reached Stonethwaite a few Stars had appeared,<lb/>

            of earth and heaven commingled yet without terror – for we<lb/>
            knew that the Storm would pass away; for so our prophetic<lb/>
            Guide assured us - I forgot to tell you that I [esp]ied a Ship<lb/>

                you see the shape of it? – Miss Barker interposed – “It<lb/>

                  <p>Though known to scholars for decades, the document our edition calls the Kenyon
                Transcript remains mysterious. It has traditionally been catalogued as Dorothy’s
                “Letter to William Johnson,” but this designation is slightly misleading. 
                First of all, Dorothy had no direct part in creating this document; indeed, there is no way
                to know if she even authorized it. Second, it was not mailed to William Johnson. It
                might have been mailed <hi rend="italic">by</hi> him, or under his supervision, but 
                that is a separate matter—see our conjectures in the following
                paragraphs. It seems best, all things considered, to emphasize that this is a copy
                of the Johnson letter, not the letter itself. It was a new document created with a
                different audience in mind.
            </p>
                  <p>We have limited information about the Kenyon Transcript’s making. The editors of
                William and Dorothy Wordsworth’s letters (second edition), Moorman and Hill,
                supposed that the copyist might be John Carter, William Wordsworth’s longtime clerk.
                However, handwriting comparison shows that this tentative attribution is incorrect.
                Ultimately, we do not know for certain who made the transcript or why, but we do
                have several clues.
            </p>
                  <p>Though a letter, in some ways the Kenyon Transcript hardly seems like one: it
                includes no salutation, no signature, no epistolary framing at all aside from the
                fact that it is folded, addressed, and mailed. However, its address panel provides
                essential information (fig. 5.10). This panel features different handwriting from
                the body of the text (perhaps two different hands, in fact—one for the date line and
                the other for the address) and reads, “Ellesmere January three 1819 / Miss
                Hutchinson / Hindwell / Radnor.” Inserted on the left is “free[?] Kenyon,” which we
                take to be a parliamentary frank.

                  <p>Ellesmere is a market town in Shropshire. “Miss Hutchinson,” presumably, is Sara
                Hutchinson, who is mentioned briefly in the transcription.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">SH’s younger sister Joanna was also at Hindwell at this time.
                    Consequently, though “Miss Hutchinson” probably designates SH, the elder sibling, 
                    we should admit to slight uncertainty. The transcript’s mention of SH comes at the end: 
                    “To add to our uncommon performances on this Day Miss Barker and I each wrote a letter 
                    from the top of the Pike to our far distant Friend in South Wales – Sara Hutchinson.”</note> 
                Hindwell is the Hutchinson family farm in Radnorshire, South Wales.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">The family’s long-term lease of the property began in 1809. 
                    On the history and importance of Hindwell to the Hutchinsons, see R. C. B. Oliver, 
                    “The (Wordsworth) Hutchinsons in Radnorshire and on the Border,” 24–46.</note>
                Kenyon must be an MP or a peer, since he can post a letter without charge.
            </p>
                  <p>Summarizing, then, the Kenyon Transcript is a copy of Dorothy Wordsworth’s
                late-October 1818 letter to William Johnson that was made sometime between then and
                3 January 1819. It was sent from Ellesmere to the Hutchinsons’ home in Radnor, some
                47 miles away, under a certain Kenyon’s franking privilege. With these facts in
                mind, we can begin to reconstruct a possible history of the manuscript.
            </p>
                  <p>Who might Kenyon be? We propose that he is not, as some might suppose, John Kenyon,
                who appears frequently (in later years) in the Wordsworth family correspondence,
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">John Kenyon (1784–1856), minor poet, cousin to
                    Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and friend to several nineteenth-century literary celebrities,
                    did not meet the Wordsworths until later in 1819.</note>
                but rather George, Lord Kenyon, 2nd Baron Kenyon (1776–1855). Comparing the signature
                on the address panel with signatures on known letters of Kenyon’s, we find a close match (fig. 5.11).

                  <p>Lord Kenyon, a lawyer and staunch promoter of the Church of England, was among other
                things a patron of educational reform. Kenyon might not have known Dorothy
                Wordsworth personally,
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">We have yet to ascertain this point. The Wordsworths
                    and Kenyon had so many common acquaintances that it would not be at all surprising to 
                    learn that they had met. William’s brother Christopher corresponded with Lord Kenyon 
                    (see, for instance, a letter of 5 December 1816, which Christopher sent to Kenyon at 
                    Gredington—cited in Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts, 
                    <title level="m">Manuscripts of Lord Kenyon</title>, 564).</note> 
                but he knew several of her friends. Consequently, unfolding the history of this transcript 
                involves reconstructing a social network. The first character of note, naturally, is 
                Johnson himself, the recipient of Dorothy’s original letter, who had become close to 
                the Wordsworths during his 1811–1812 curacy in Grasmere. Johnson knew the 
                Hutchinsons as well and might have wished to forward Dorothy’s account to Hindwell 
                in any case. But what was Johnson’s connection, if any, to Kenyon? It turns out that
                Johnson was affiliated with an organization called the National Society for Promoting
                the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church in England and 
                Wales (hereafter “National Society”), founded in 1811, and that Kenyon was 
                one of that organization’s vice presidents.
            </p>
                  <p>The National Society established schools employing the “Madras System” of 
                mutual instruction pioneered by Dr. Andrew Bell, the next important character in our story.
                Bell and Kenyon were allies in their shared educational projects; and Bell, like
                Johnson, was a friend to Dorothy and William Wordsworth.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">On Bell’s warm relationship with Dorothy, see 
                    <title level="m">DWB</title>, 273.</note>
                Indeed, it was Bell who hired Johnson away from Grasmere in January 1812 (supported by
                recommendations from the Wordsworths, though they were sorry to see him leave) to place
                him at the head of his model Central School in London. We also know that Bell was 
                acquainted with the Hutchinsons as well as with Dorothy’s climbing companion, Mary Barker.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">Bell was one of the early visitors to Mary Barker’s
                    new Borrowdale home. See SH’s letter from Rosthwaite to Thomas Monkhouse (then at 
                    Anthony Harrison’s in Penrith), dated “c. 1815” in the Wordsworth Trust catalogue 
                    but probably written in the fall of 1817 (WLMS H/1/6/1).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Robert Southey’s <hi rend="italic">Life of the Rev. Andrew Bell</hi> indicates that,
                through Bell, William Johnson had met Lord Kenyon by at least August 1812, when
                Kenyon visited the Central School and “spoke most highly of Mr. Johnson’s
                superintendence.”
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">Southey, <title level="m">Life of the Rev. Andrew Bell</title>, 2:441.</note> 
                Over time, the three men had numerous interactions, including at meetings of the National Society.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">Minutes of these meetings survive in the
                    society’s annual reports. One such report puts Kenyon and Johnson in the same room earlier 
                    in 1818. See <title level="m">Seventh Annual Report of the National Society</title>, 283.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In December 1818, not long after Dorothy’s Scafell Pike ascent, Johnson and Bell
                together visited Lord Kenyon at his seat, Gredington Hall, which was at Hanmer, near
                the Welsh-English border.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Southey, <title level="m">Life of the Rev. Andrew Bell</title>, 3:173.</note>
                This could have been the occasion for Johnson to share with his two friends his remarkable 
                letter from Dorothy Wordsworth—the moment also when the copy was made and sent to 
                Hindwell. Why mail it from Ellesmere? This is also uncertain, but Ellesmere was just five miles from
                Gredington Hall, and Kenyon had established a school there. Possibly he, Bell, and
                Johnson went there for an inspection. Additional research may shed light on this
                question. In any case, we know that the document was mailed under Kenyon’s frank and
                that it originated at or near his home; this is our reason for calling it the Kenyon
                Transcript.
            </p>
                  <p>After visiting Kenyon at the end of 1818, Bell went straight to the Lake District,
                where he spent several days with the Wordsworths before taking lodgings at Keswick,
                near the Southeys.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Southey, <title level="m">Life of the Rev. Andrew Bell</title>,
                    3:174. Southey became Bell’s literary executor. Thomas Davies, Bell’s former clerk, gathered 
                    Bell’s papers and moved to Keswick to assist Southey with the writing of Bell’s biography. 
                    Sadly, Southey’s health failed in the middle of the project, which had to be completed by 
                    his widow, Caroline Bowles Southey, and his son, Charles Cuthbert Southey, with Davies’s 
                    assistance.</note>
                William Johnson, too, visited the Wordsworths in January 1819, arriving just five days after
                Bell’s departure.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">DW reports on the visits of Bell and Johnson in a 12 
                    January 1819 letter to Catherine Clarkson. Bell departed on the 11th, and Johnson was 
                    expected on the 16th. In this same letter, DW concludes, “All well at Hindwell—all 
                    well here” (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 3:519–20). See also 
                    <title level="m">LMW</title>, 49.</note>
                In short, Dorothy’s writing was probably circulating among this entire set of acquaintances—people
                who often communicated in person when not doing so by letter.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">One implication of this social context is that any number
                    of people might have known that DW and Mary Barker were the ones who made the Scafell Pike 
                    climb, despite the reticence of WW’s <title level="m">Guide</title>. Reports might have 
                    circulated in conversation as well as in writing. Many in DW’s extended circle might have 
                    said, with Jonathan Otley, “We have heard these stories of our kind Borrowdale neighbors 
                    so often, that . . . we, at least, think we know how they should be told” 
                    (<title level="m">Kendal Mercury</title>, 26 May 1855, 6).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Several questions remain. Judging from the handwriting, Kenyon did not personally
                duplicate Dorothy’s remarkable ascent narrative, but who did? Not Bell or
                Johnson—their hands, too, were quite different. Possibly a clerk for one of these
                men was the scribe, or perhaps one of them wished to test an amanuensis.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">One interesting suspect is Thomas Davies, Bell’s
                    amanuensis, mentioned in n26. He was introduced to Bell by Kenyon in late 1817 or 
                    early 1818. One sample of Davies’s writing, an 1831 letter from Bell to Lady Burke,
                    survives in the archive at the Wordsworth Trust. Some features of his hand resemble
                    elements in the Kenyon Transcript, but others match less closely. Given that the 1818
                    letter to Hindwell was a fair copy of sorts, presumably in the transcriber’s finest
                    writing, and that the 1831 letter is a sample of quick dictation (written, moreover,
                    well over a decade later), it is hard to draw any certain conclusion. Additional 
                    samples of Davies’s writing reside in various archives, so we hope to update this
                    discussion as research advances.</note>
                Further research on Kenyon’s, Bell’s, or Johnson’s papers may yet allow us to identify
                the copyist with certainty. Even then, however, we shall be left with a puzzle, not
                knowing precisely why the copy was made and sent. One can, of course, imagine scenarios:
                for instance, Johnson, along with Bell and Kenyon, might suspect that the Hutchinson 
                family would enjoy reading Dorothy’s account, especially because Sara was mentioned 
                in it and had already been teased by “wish-you-were-here” notes written by Dorothy 
                and Mary Barker at the Scafell Pike summit. (Indeed, the fact that the Kenyon Transcript
                begins without preamble makes one wonder if the recipient were already expecting it.) And
                then, Johnson might appreciate an excuse to reach out to his old friends, the
                Hutchinsons—at one point, Sara and others thought that Johnson might be a good match
                for her younger sister Joanna, who was also at Hindwell in January 1819.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">For hints on Johnson as a marriage prospect for Joanna
                    Hutchinson, see SH’s letter to John Monkhouse of 28 March 1812 (Hutchinson, 
                    <title level="m">Letters</title>, 44) and DW’s letter to Mary Hutchinson (née Monkhouse) 
                    of 1 February 1813 (<hi rend="italic">Letters</hi>, 3:80).</note> 
                Perhaps Johnson, still unmarried, held on to similar thoughts. Of course, this is all speculation.</p>

                  <p>It was my intention, several years ago, to describe a regular tour through this
                country, taking the different scenes in the most favourable order; but after some
                progress had been made in the work it was abandoned from a conviction, that, if well
                executed, it would lessen the pleasure of the Traveller by anticipation, and, if the
                contrary, it would only mislead him. The Reader may not however be displeased with
                the following extract from a letter to a Friend, giving an account of a visit to a
                summit of one <span change="brown">[page break]</span> of the highest of these
                mountains; of which I am reminded by the observations of Mr. West, and by reviewing
                what has been said of this district in comparison with the Alps.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">This introductory paragraph is entirely new for the 
                <title level="m">Guide</title>. DW’s narrative voice takes over at “Having left Rossthwaite 
                in Borrowdale.”</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having left Rossthwaite in Borrowdale, on a bright morning in the first week of
                October, we ascended from Seathwaite to the top of the ridge, called Ash-course, and
                thence beheld three distinct views. On one side, the continuous Vale of Borrowdale,
                Keswick, and Bassenthwaite,—with Skiddaw, Helvellyn, Saddleback, and numerous other
                mountains,—and, in the distance, the Solway Frith and the Mountains of Scotland. On
                the other side, and below us, the Langdale Pikes—their own vale below <hi rend="italic">them</hi>; —Windermere, — and, far beyond Windermere, Ingleborough
                in Yorkshire. But how shall I speak of the deliciousness of the third prospect! At
                this time, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was most favoured by sunshine and shade. The
                green Vale of Esk—deep and green, with its glittering serpent stream, was below us;
                and, on we looked to the Mountains near the Sea —Black Comb pre-eminent,—and, still
                beyond, to the Sea itself in dazzling brightness. Turning round
                <span change="color">[page break]</span> we saw the Mountains
                of Wastdale in tumult; to our right, Great Gavel, the loftiest, a distinct, and <hi rend="italic">huge</hi> 
                form, though the middle of the mountain was, to our eyes, as its base.
            </p>
                  <p>We had attained the object of this journey; but our ambition now mounted higher. We
                saw the summit of Scaw-fell, apparently very near to us; and we shaped our course
                towards it; but, discovering that it could not be reached without first making a
                considerable descent, we resolved, instead, to aim at another point of the same
                mountain, called the <hi rend="italic">Pikes</hi>, which I have since found has been
                estimated as higher than the summit bearing the name of Scawfell Head,
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">DCMS 51 has “Scaw Fell” here, but WW seems eager
                to distinguish more carefully between neighboring Scafell (“Scawfell Head”) and the
                slightly higher Scafell Pike.</note> where the Stone Man is built.</p>
                  <p>The sun had never once been overshadowed by a cloud during the whole of our progress
                from the centre of Borrowdale: — on the summit of the Pike, which we gained after
                much toil though without difficulty, there was not a breath of air to stir even the
                papers containing our refreshment, as they lay spread out upon a rock. The stillness
                seemed to be not of this world: — we paused, and kept silence to listen; and no
                sound could be heard: the Scawfell <span change="brown">[page break]</span> 
                Cataracts were voiceless to us; and there was not an insect to hum in the air. The
                vales which we had seen from Ash-course lay yet in view; and, side by side with
                Eskdale, we now saw the sister Vale of Donnerdale terminated by the Duddon Sands.
                But the majesty of the mountains below, and close to us, is not to be conceived. We
                now beheld the whole mass of Great Gavel from its base,—the Den of Wastdale at our
                feet— a gulph immeasurable: Grasmire and the other mountains of Crummock— Ennerdale
                and its mountains; and the Sea beyond! Gladly<note place="foot" resp="editors">This passage 
                (from “Gladly” to “spotless snow,” the end of the paragraph) is WW’s, relocated from elsewhere
                in the <title level="m">Guide</title>. A version of it first appeared on p. 43 of 
                <title level="m">Select Views</title> (1810), in a section describing the neighborhood of Great Gavel,
                Scafell Pike, and the Styhead Pass. It disappeared from the 1820 <title level="m">River Duddon</title>
                version of the text, only to return in this 1822 application.</note>
                would we have tempered our beverage (for there was no spring or well near us) with
                such a supply of delicious water as we might have procured, had we been on the rival
                summit of Great Gavel; for on its highest point is a small triangular receptacle of
                water in the native rock, which, the shepherds say, is never dry. There, we might
                have slaked our thirst plenteously with a pure and celestial beverage, for the cup
                or basin, it appears, has no other feeder than the dews of heaven, the showers, the
                vapours, the hoar frost, and the spotless snow. <span change="brown">[page break]</span>
                  </p>
                  <p>While we were gazing around, “Look,” I exclaimed, “at yon ship upon the glittering
                sea!” “Is it a Ship?” replied our Shepherd-guide. “It can be nothing else,”
                interposed my companion; “I cannot be mistaken, I am so accustomed to the appearance
                of Ships at sea.” The Guide dropped the argument; but, before a minute was gone, he
                quietly said, “Now look at your Ship; it is changed into a Horse.” So indeed it
                was,—a horse with a gallant neck and head. We laughed heartily; and, I hope, when
                again inclined to be positive, I may remember the Ship and the Horse upon the
                glittering Sea; and the calm confidence, yet submissiveness, of our wise Man of the
                Mountains, who certainly had more knowledge of clouds than we, whatever might be our
                knowledge of ships.
            </p>
                  <p>I know not how long we might have remained on the summit of the Pike, without a
                thought of moving, had not our guide warned us that we must not linger; for a storm
                was coming. We looked in vain to espy the signs of it. Mountains, vales, and sea
                were touched with the clear light of the sun. “It is <span change="brown">[page break]</span>
                there,” he said, pointing to the sea beyond Whitehaven, and there we
                perceived a light vapour unnoticeable but by a Shepherd accustomed to watch all
                mountain bodings. We gazed around again, and yet again, unwilling to lose the
                remembrance of what lay before us in that lofty solitude; and then prepared to
                depart. Meanwhile the air changed to cold, and we saw that tiny vapour swelled into
                mighty masses of cloud which came boiling over the mountains. Great Gavel,
                Helvellyn, and Skiddaw, were wrapped in storm; yet Langdale, and the mountains in
                that quarter, remained all bright in sunshine. Soon the storm reached us; we
                sheltered under a crag; and almost as rapidly as it had come it passed away, and
                left us free to observe the struggles of gloom and sunshine in other quarters.
                Langdale now had its share, and the Pikes of Langdale were decorated by two splendid
                Rainbows; Skiddaw also had its own Rainbows. Before we again reached Ash-course
                every cloud had vanished from every summit.
            </p>
                  <p>I ought to have mentioned that round the top of Scawfell PIKE not a blade of grass is
                to <span change="brown">[page break]</span> be seen. A few cushions or tufts of     
                moss, parched and brown, appear between the huge blocks and stones that lie in heaps
                on all sides to a great distance, like skeletons or bones of the earth not needed at
                the creation, and there left to be covered with never-dying lichens, which the
                clouds and dews nourish; and adorn with colours of vivid and exquisite beauty.
                Flowers, the most brilliant feathers,<note place="foot" resp="editors">The comparison 
                to “brilliant feathers” appears to be one of WW’s innovations. It appears
                in none of the manuscript sources, though DW does write of the colors that “no
                gems or flowers can surpass” in DCMS 51.</note>
                and even gems, scarcely surpass in colouring some of those masses of stone, which no
                human eye beholds, except the Shepherd or Traveller be led thither by curiosity: and
                how seldom must this happen! For the other Eminence is the one visited by the
                adventurous Traveller; and the Shepherd has no inducement to ascend the PIKE in
                quest of his Sheep; for no food is <hi rend="italic">there</hi> to tempt them. 
            </p>
                  <p>We certainly were singularly favoured in the weather; for when we were seated on the
                summit, our Conductor, turning his eyes thoughtfully round, said, “I do not know
                that in my whole life, I was ever, at any season of the year, so high upon the
                mountains on so calm a day.” (It was the 7th of October.) Afterwards we had the
                storm, which exhibited the grandeur of <span change="brown">[page break]</span>
                the earth and heavens commingled; yet without terror. We knew that it would pass
                away; — for so our prophetic Guide had assured us.

                  <p>Before we reached Seathwaite in Borrowdale, a few stars had appeared, and we pursued
                our way down the Vale, to Rossthwaite, by moonlight.

                    </head>
                  <p>Dorothy Wordsworth poems appeared in nineteenth-century collections of her brother’s
                verse. Individual poems began to appear in twentieth-century teaching anthologies, however the
                first comprehensive presentation of her poems didn’t appear until 1987, when Susan
                Levin published them as the appendix to her critical study <title level="m">Dorothy
                Wordsworth and Romanticism</title>, an effort she later amplified with her
                important teaching edition, <title level="m">Dorothy Wordsworth: A Longman Cultural 
                Edition</title>, in 2009. These were milestone events, as Levin’s editorial work
                introduced the poems to a broad academic audience and sparked a wave in which scholars
                such as Pamela Woof, Rachel Feder, Lucy Newlyn, and Levin herself published thoughtful
                readings of Dorothy’s verse. Since their first appearance in Levin’s monograph
                in 1987, several of Dorothy’s poems have been anthologized, frequently appearing
                alongside selections from the Grasmere journal notebooks. Two notable poems,
                <title level="a">Thoughts on my Sickbed</title> and <title level="a">Grasmere—A 
                Fragment,</title> have also been included in recent editions of the <title level="m">Norton
                Anthology of English Literature</title> and the <title level="m">Broadview Anthology of
                British Literature</title>. Interestingly, the poems currently featured in teaching
                anthologies are not among the five that were published in Dorothy’s lifetime. Even
                <title level="a">Floating Island at Hawkshead,</title> perhaps her best-known and finest poem,
                has been omitted. But the anthologized examples are, arguably, those that may be considered
                her most “Wordsworthian,” insofar as they elaborate themes also found in her
                brother’s poetry, such as the wonderment and healing powers of nature and the imagination.
                Furthermore, they converse overtly with William’s poems, offering useful comparisons
                for the classroom, though also implying through the selection process that what matters most
                in Dorothy’s verse are these resonances.

                  <p>This electronic edition applies a different theory of inclusion, as we neither
                collect all of Dorothy’s known poems, as edited by Levin and pulled from various
                print and manuscript sources, nor present a selection based on connections with
                William’s work or subjective judgments on aesthetic value or biographical relevance.
                Instead, we offer a substantial (and arguably representative) sample based on the
                material practices of Dorothy’s writing and grounded in a single manuscript: Dove
                Cottage Manuscript (DCMS) 120, commonly referred to as the “commonplace book” (fig.
                6.1). In this battered notebook with paper boards, purchased in November 1820,
                       <note place="foot" resp="editors">DCMS 120’s label survives to provide details
                       about where it was purchased: GRISET FILS AINÉ, a shop in
                       Boulogne-Sur-Mer that DW, WW, and MW visited in November 1820 near the
                       end of their Continental tour. A detailed description of the notebook
                       appears in the section <title level="a">Textual and Editorial Issues</title>.

                Dorothy collected most of the poems she wrote during her lifetime,
                often in multiple versions. In most cases, she revised while collecting and copying,
                as is evident by edits on the notebook’s pages, though some poems were copied fair.
                In total, the notebook’s 89 leaves contain 22 poems in 38 versions. Most of these
                poems were composed and entered in the notebook between 1826 and 1832, though new
                entries appeared until 1840.
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors">As Levin has done the most extensive work 
                        in dating the poems, her dates are used in this edition (<title level="m">

                Rather than seek to identify (or create) fixed versions of her poems through the 
                editorial process, this section of the edition represents the multiple and unsettled
                versions of her poetry in this one artifact, wherein it becomes possible to observe
                Dorothy returning to her poems over time as she rereads, revises, and recopies them.

                  <p>DCMS 120 also contains a considerable quantity of other material, copied from
                newspapers and from other manuscripts as well as some print clippings. The
                miscellaneous nature of the notebook’s contents may be seen in the 
                <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.poems-contents.html">first table of
                contents created for this edition</ref>. Included are all of Dorothy’s
                poems written to or about members of her domestic circle, alongside recipes,
                epitaphs, and other snippets of poetry and prose. Interestingly,
                Dorothy also incorporates fair copies of her poems handwritten by others,
                demonstrating that her poetry (like the notebook itself) was shared with a group.
                She annotates her own handwritten poems with emphatic markings, often in
                pencil—adding another stratum to their textual archaeology. While our emphasis is on
                the poetry within DCMS 120, we also wish to call attention, through the complete
                table of contents, to the interplay of her poetry with the other material she copies
                or pastes into the notebook.
            </p>
                  <p>It should be noted as well that many of the poems included here are also preserved in
                other documents outside of DCMS 120—in notebooks, letters, and separate sheets, as
                copies Dorothy gifted to others. Nonetheless, we find that focusing on this one
                notebook and the history of its making and use allows us to reanimate Dorothy’s
                poetry within the period’s thriving manuscript culture. Though in many ways Dorothy
                drafted, revised, shared, and preserved her writing as a professional author might,
                her verse was rarely if ever intended for a print audience. Nonetheless, she had
                readers. This notebook did not directly serve her brother’s professional literary
                career, as arguably did the Grasmere journal notebooks and other manuscripts
                discussed in this edition, but this does not mean that Dorothy did not share her
                poetry or intend it to be read and enjoyed by others. Rather, DCMS 120 reflects both
                the social activities of composing, gifting, exchanging, and collecting, as well as
                Dorothy’s possibly more private processes, particularly with poetry, of recopying,
                rereading, and rewriting.
            </p>
                  <p>A commonplace book is traditionally understood to be a handmade collection of
                edifying or inspiring quotations that reflect upon the collector’s reading. Although
                the term has developed a more capacious meaning, partly because commonplacing became
                less systematized in the nineteenth century, it is nevertheless somewhat misapplied
                to Dorothy’s notebook, which is only in part an account of her reading. DCMS 120
                might more accurately be called a manuscript miscellany, exemplifying a traditional
                method of curation that thrived in the eighteenth century, particularly for poetry;
                the miscellany can also be, as it is in this case, a space for drafting, collecting,
                and preserving heterogeneous material. As noted previously, one of DCMS 120’s most
                important functions was to gather both drafts and fair copies of nearly all of
                Dorothy’s poems. However, it also included poetry and prose authored by others, in a
                variety of forms. Dorothy preserved this material both through the act of directly
                copying onto pages in the notebook and by pasting loose sheets into the notebook
                pages. The manuscript miscellany gathers contributions from various sources and
                people into a single (if somewhat chaotic) space, both representing and embodying a
                literary community.
            </p>
                  <p>One advantage of studying and editing a single notebook, then, is that it provides
                access to the messy and complex nature of manuscript writing and literary exchange.
                One disadvantage is that approaching such a collection can feel unfamiliar and even
                alienating. DCMS 120 defies many expectations of today’s readers, who are used to
                encountering regularized print. Like DCMS 20, it starts at both ends, a feature that
                Margaret Ezell describes as “a doubling of the matter in an inverted format,”
                resulting in “a practice alien to print technology . . . and disorienting for modern
                readers.”

                As in other draft manuscripts, corrections, revisions, and errors remain visible in
                layers, as Dorothy works and reworks her lines. Time is thus encoded on the pages in
                a way that is distinctive to the scribal medium. Meanwhile, white space within the
                manuscript is unevenly distributed, with some pages left entirely blank, some barely
                written on, and others crammed with writing. There are pages cut or torn or patched,
                all contributing to a lack of uniformity that is indicative of the book being filled
                over time, without a predetermined plan. Text appears at multiple angles and
                cross-written; there are sheets pasted in horizontally that must be folded out, and
                the entire book must be manipulated and rotated throughout for proper reading. There
                are essentially no navigational tools—no tables of contents, indices, signatures,
                attributions, or page numbers, and very few titles. Legibility, regularity, and
                re-usability are all compromised. In many ways, then, the notebook is impenetrable
                to us—undecipherable in places, with missing pages, unknown hands, and unidentified
                scraps copied and clipped from print and manuscript sources. It is a book in which
                we struggle to find a single or clear narrative except of use and ongoing
                engagement. Nonetheless, its tolerance of variation and indeed messiness—the
                willingness to allow for corrections and variants to remain visible, with draft and
                fair copies remaining side by side—enables a revisiting of past versions and past
                selves, very much a Wordsworthian theme at the core of Dorothy’s as well as her
                brother’s poetics.
            </p>
                  <p>A complicated manuscript like DCMS 120 presents special challenges to editors, but
                the digital platform of Romantic Circles makes it possible for us to convey a sense
                of the poems’ material environment. Figure 6.2 suggests the many kinds of activities
                and artifacts in DCMS 120. On the verso appear the last two stanzas of “Irregular
                Stanzas / Holiday at Gwerndovennant May 1826,” with sums visible at the bottom left,
                demonstrating a thrifty (and very common) use of blank space. On the recto is the
                final page of a tipped-in fair copy version, on lavender wove paper, of <title level="a">Grasmere—A
                Fragment</title> (insert 2), a poem of unknown date that appears in four versions in the
                notebook.
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors">The Wordsworth Trust has labeled all added pages as inserts. This is insert 2.</note>
                Viewing the open notebook, we also observe the multidirectionality of the writing,
                which here occurs in three orientations.

                  <p>Looking more closely at the recto page featured in figure 6.2, we may notice
                additional details. Figure 6.3 reproduces and enlarges the page’s penultimate
                stanza. Here, Dorothy recopies, twice, in pencil, the expression “Trust me” from the
                stanza’s first line, strongly emphasizing its message on the passage of time: “Too
                soon your hearts shall own / The past is all that is your own.” Thus, the manuscript
                carries a sting—a poignant indication of the poet’s feeling in later life.

                  <p>Sharon Cameron has observed of Emily Dickinson’s manuscript variants that many appear
                to place her both within and “outside the ostensible boundaries of the poem.”

                Dorothy Wordsworth occupies the same double or multiple positionality, as an older
                self often encircles a younger one in poems that themselves thematize the passage of time.
                In this way, throughout DCMS 120, we observe traces of Dorothy rereading and reworking her own
                life. Often her revisions are less about altering the meaning and more about
                accentuating and perhaps even, in the act of rewriting, re-experiencing feelings. As
                Pamela Woof perceptively observes, “The constant return to lines and snatches from
                the poems provides for her a way to investigate her own mind.”

                In penciled additions to <title level="a">Lines intended for my Niece’s Album,</title>
                Dorothy underlines the phrase “no longer young” apparently to add emphasis and
                to mark the additional passage of time since the poem was originally written, or both.
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors">Dora Wordsworth’s Album is held at the Wordsworth Trust, DCMS 122.</note>
                She also uses penciled marginal notes to adjust the pronouns: in ink, she refers to
                the time “when the cold earth covers her,” but in her penciled markings—more variant
                readings than revisions—she returns the poem to the more intimate, if morbid, first
                person, imagining the moment when “the cold earth covers me.” By preserving this
                adjustment, which directly invokes the poet’s mortality, the manuscript reveals acts
                of rereading and reengagement that personalize and renew the poetry’s meaning.

                        <title level="a">Preface</title> to this collection, WW noted, “Three short pieces (now first 
                        published) are the work of a Female Friend; and the Reader, to whom they may be acceptable, 
                        is indebted to me for his pleasure; if any one regard them with dislike, or be disposed to 
                        condemn them, let the censure fall upon him, who, trusting in his own sense of their merit and

                        For the siblings’ longtime friend Charles Lamb and his sister Mary, however, this was
                        overly coy. In a 7 April 1815 letter to WW, Charles Lamb remarks, “We
                        were glad to see the poems by a female friend. The one of the wind is
                        masterly, but not new to us. Being only three, perhaps you might have
                        clapt a D. at the corner and let it have past as a printer’s mark to the
                        uninitiated, as a delightful hint to the better-instructed. As it is,
                        Expect a formal criticism on the Poems of your female friend, and she
                        must expect it” (<title level="m">Letters of Charles and Mary Lamb</title>, 
                        1:141). WW did eventually accept this advice, including DW’s initials in 
                        some later editions.

                Several decades later, two additional poems, <title level="a">Loving &amp; Liking</title>
                and <title level="a">Floating Island at Hawkshead,</title> were included semi-anonymously 
                in the 1836 and 1842 editions, respectively, of William’s collected works.

                While these latter two poems and 20 others by Dorothy appear in DCMS
                120, the three poems published in 1815 do not. Given that she did not purchase the
                notebook until five years after these poems’ first appearance in print, she
                apparently saw no reason to recopy and collect them. This theory is supported by the
                fact that DCMS 120 does include several versions of <title level="a">Loving &amp; 
                Liking</title> and <title level="a">Floating Island,</title> which were not published 
                until long after she obtained the notebook.

                These five are relatively short (the longest is 20 lines), and four are clearly
                addressed to members of her social circle. Evidence that nearly all of her poems
                circulated in manuscript during her lifetime comes in surviving copies included in
                her correspondence and written in the hands of family or friends. Though this
                introduction primarily addresses the poems contained in DCMS 120 and the practices
                of drafting, revision, collection, and sharing revealed within its pages, it is
                important to acknowledge the notebook’s place within a larger set of surviving
                documents that demonstrate Dorothy writing and sharing her verses.
            </p>
                  <p>While many of the poems are hard to date with precision, most seem to have been
                written in the 1820s and 1830s, when Dorothy was in her 50s and 60s and living at
                Rydal Mount with William and his family. As a result, the poems trace themes that
                are somewhat different from those that dominate her earlier writing, for example, in
                the first Grasmere journal notebook, before William had a wife and children. The
                passage of time and its effects on the body and her familial and social
                relationships are constant themes of the poems, as Dorothy reflects on both her
                younger and older selves. A few poems do return to quite early times; for instance,
                <title level="a">Grasmere—A Fragment</title> recounts the Wordsworths’ 
                arrival in Grasmere in late 1799. Nevertheless, most of the poems differ from the
                descriptions of daily life and local scenes that are found in the <title level="m">
                Grasmere Journals</title>, being more centrally focused on her anxiety about writing
                poetry (an insecurity not much expressed in her other writing) and her reflections
                on aging and the fragility of the body.

                </head>
                  <p>While most poems in DCMS 120—15 in number—are presented in only one version,
                seven appear in multiple revisions. One poem, <title level="a">Lines written (rather say 
                begun),</title> appears in seven distinct versions. As is to be expected with a working 
                notebook that is filled over years, the poems are not organized or arranged in any 
                prescribed or logical order. Moreover, as previously noted, DCMS 120 is an amigraph—
                a book filled from both ends. How, then, to number the pages? The stationer’s label
                on the cover determines the orientation we designate as the front, and indeed the notebook
                is largely filled from that end.

                        </note> 
                It is possible that Dorothy began to fill the notebook from the front first, as the first
                dated entry is from 1830, and then began to use the book from the rear cover, chiefly to
                attach copies of her poems made by others, with the first copy pasted in being <title level="a">Lines to Dora</title> and dated 1835. After 1835, she likely used the book
                from both ends. An amigraph is a difficult object to replicate outside of a physical
                facsimile, as it is arguably even more difficult to flip a screen than it is a book.

                  <p>Dorothy frequently expressed anxiety about her poetic abilities, and her
                self-deprecating statements have shaped the reception of her poetry, which has
                received less attention and far less praise than the journals and her travel
                writing. When, in 1806, her friend and quasi-patron Lady Beaumont encouraged her to
                try verse, Dorothy responded with a detailed history of her efforts in the genre
                that is worth quoting at length:
            
                    <quote>Believe me, since I received your letter I have made several attempts (could I do
                    less as you request that I would <emph>for your sake</emph>?) and have been obliged to
                    give it up in despair; and looking into my mind I find nothing there, even if I had the
                    gift of language and numbers, that I could have the vanity to suppose could be of any use
                    beyond our own fireside, or to please, as in your case, a few partial friends; but I have
                    no command of language, no power of expressing my ideas, and no one was ever more inapt at
                    molding words into regular metre. I have often tried when I have been walking alone
                    (muttering to myself as is my Brother’s custom) to express my feelings in verse;
                    feelings, and ideas such as they were, I have never wanted at those times; but prose and
                    rhyme and blank verse were jumbled together and nothing ever came of it.

                Family members sometimes repeated this narrative of Dorothy struggling with formal
                verse. In 1832, for instance, Dora enclosed some of her aunt’s verses in a letter to
                Edward Quillinan, remarking, “You must excuse limping measure. Aunt cannot write
                regular metre.”

                  <p>Partly due to such assessments, Dorothy’s poems have been regarded as categorically
                inferior to her prose works, even by sympathetic readers. The preeminent early
                twentieth-century Wordsworth scholar Ernest de Sélincourt, for one, concluded that
                her poems “have little intrinsic merit,” opining that “only rarely
                are they lit up by that alertness of vision and felicity of phrasing of which to the
                last her prose was capable.”

                At the opposite end of the twentieth century, the pioneering editor of her works, Susan
                Levin, summed up the enduring consensus that “uneven in quality, Dorothy’s
                poetry sometimes has the effect of making us more appreciative of her talents as a prose
                writer.”

                  </p>
                  <p>In the aforementioned letter to Lady Beaumont, Dorothy claims to have no expressive
                power or metrical ability; however, she was in a singularly challenging position in
                attempting to compose poetry alongside her brother, particularly in 1806, when
                William was writing some of the finest poetry of his life. Levin describes this
                “anxiety of influence” making it “difficult for Dorothy to write
                poetry.” In this reading, Dorothy’s habitual self-denigration is everywhere
                evident as she sets her poems against his.

                Some evidence supports this view. Even two decades later, in “To Julia Marshall
                —A Fragment,” a poem dated to 1827 and addressed to her goddaughter, whose
                mother, Jane Pollard Marshall, was Dorothy’s lifelong friend, she explores her
                fraught relationship with poetry. She returns to her childhood and explains that, even
                though she “reverenced the Poets’ skill,”

                  <p>In an apparent allusion to Alexander Pope’s <title level="a">Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot,
               </title> where Pope peaks about how easily versification came to him—“I 
               lisp’d in numbers, for the numbers came”—Dorothy explains the fear of
               humiliation that prevented her from pursuing poetry. Writing these lines in 1827, she had
               not yet forgotten the unnamed “elder heads” and “playmates” who
               “stifle[d]” her poetic ambition as a child, many decades earlier.
           </p>
                  <p>Rather than amplify this narrative of constraint and discouragement, however, we
                prefer to frame our approach to Dorothy’s poetry by asking, to paraphrase 
                Margaret Ezell, “‘What is this author attempting to do?’”

                Unlike her brother, Dorothy did not regularly compose poetry with print publication
                in mind. Instead, she usually addressed her poems to specific individuals, or to
                commemorate specific experiences or events. As she explains in the 1806 letter to
                Lady Beaumont, she wrote primarily for friends and family, rarely imagining an audience
                that extended “beyond [their] own fireside.” She also appears to have found
                it difficult to write upon command, as her friends’ requests for verse often
                languished. For the most part, Dorothy seems to have written when inspired, to reflect
                on stirring moments, or to express special friendship. Though she preserved only a small
                number of poems, she returned to many of these, reworking and copying them for friends
                and family. Some of the poems, of course, found enthusiastic readers, as when Charles and Mary
                Lamb praised “Address to a Child” as “masterly.”
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors">Letter from Charles Lamb to WW, 7 April 1815.</note>
                But Dorothy’s body of poetry illustrates an understanding of herself as primarily
                a manuscript poet, writing for a select few but also rewriting and rereading for herself.

                    D. “D. Wordsworth: Old Poetess”
                </head>
                  <p>In several poems, Dorothy writes as a fixture in her brother’s home and loving
                aunt to his children. As Levin has observed, “Many of Dorothy’s poems
                are written in the voice of a woman who considers her life and her past in relation
                to the children or younger women around her.”

                        <title level="m">Levin</title>, 110.</note> 
                Importantly, of the five Dorothy poems published with William’s during her
                lifetime, four of them explicitly position her as a maiden aunt or caregiver, casting
                her into a role of helpmate that continues to shape understandings of her and her
                writing. The titles of the three early poems published in 1815 describe her helping
                to rear Dora (born in 1804), Thomas (1806), Catherine (1808), and Willy (1810). By
                contrast, among the later poems included in DCMS 120, only <title level="a">Loving
                &amp; Liking</title> addresses a young child, gently admonishing its addressee for
                claiming to love roasted fowl. The speaker of the poem instructs the child that 
                animals can be loved only in their natural environments, not when they have been
                made to serve human needs or tastes.
            </p>
                  <p>By the 1820s and 1830s, the children have grown up. Two poems from 1832, respectively,
                address Edith Southey, daughter of Robert, and Dora, intimate friends for whom Dorothy
                had been something of a surrogate mother. Both had turned 28 in 1832, and, as is 
                apparent from her titles—<title level="a">Lines intended for my Niece’s 
                Album</title> (12, 13) and <title level="a">Lines intended for Edith Southey’s
                album</title> (14)—Dorothy intended these poems, along with <title level="a">
                Lines to Dora</title> (35, 36) from 1835, for the young women’s personal
                album collections. Especially popular among young British ladies of the 1820s and
                1830s, albums were blank notebooks or scrapbooks that gathered autographs and
                poetry, often solicited as were the lines from Dorothy. In her album verses, we find
                Dorothy contemplating the nature of the subgenre, the difficulties encountered in
                attempting to write on command (the title describes <title level="a">Lines intended for
                Edith Southey’s album</title> as responding to “a request made by her some
                years ago, &amp; of my own promise till now unfulfilled”) and, more broadly, her
                struggle to write poetry at all.
            </p>
                  <p>In “Lines intended for my Niece’s Album,” Dorothy asks, “But why
                should I inscribe my name, / No Poet I — no longer young?” In such verses,
                Dorothy associates poetry with youth, expressing amusement and perhaps discomfort with
                being a sexagenarian generator of keepsakes. Some months later, she signs herself, in a
                poem addressed to Edith’s sister, “Miss Bertha Southey,” as “D.
                Wordsworth Old Poetess. Oct. 7th 1836.” Most of her surviving poems were composed
                in her 50s and 60s, and in them she regularly plays the role of the “aged Friend,
                ” as she puts it in “Lines intended for my Niece’s Album.” Levin
                observes that poems to the younger generation afforded Dorothy an opportunity to meditate
                upon her own past and present:             
                
                    <quote>
                    In certain of her poems, an older, sickly, “enfeebled” speaker addresses a young
                    woman who serves as both her contrast and complement. The writing of the poems
                    establishes a series of oppositions such as youth/age, health/sickness, freedom in
                    nature/sickroom as prison. Setting out these positions in composing the poem, the
                    narrator encounters her own youthful energies mirrored in the young women she
                    addresses.

                  <p>Other poems where Dorothy employs such doubling include <title level="a">Lines Addressed
                to Joanna H.,</title> which reflects on the difference between the poet’s and 
                subject’s younger selves; <title level="a">Irregular Stanzas / Holiday at 
                Gwerndovennant May 1826,</title> in which, addressing a group of children surrounding
                the adults, she considers, “Forty years have roll’d away / Since we were
                young as you”; and <title level="a">Irregular Verses,</title> another poem
                to Julia Marshall, in which she addresses the separation between the two women and
                the difference in their lots in life, as Jane Marshall has gone on to have 10
                children. But most memorably she uses this trope in her album verses for Dora and
                Edith, the latter of which offers a noteworthy celebration of the bonds between the
                generations:

                    E. Poems of Memory and Consolation: <title level="a">I trod the hills again</title>
                  </head>
                  <p>Memory obviously plays a key role in many of the poems in DCMS 120, uniting the
                older, infirm, and relatively immobile Dorothy with the younger, spirited, and
                active one. As she notes in <title level="a">Lines Addressed to Joanna H.</title>:

                  <p>In the poignant <title level="a">Thoughts on my Sick-Bed,</title> it is memory 
                that rescues Dorothy from the captivity of illness. The poem is dated to the 
                early spring of 1832, after her first extended period of confinement that began 
                in 1830. Much like Coleridge’s 1797 poem <title level="a">This Lime Tree
                Bower, my Prison,</title> in which Coleridge laments being unable to join
                his friends on a ramble due to a recent injury, <title level="a">Thoughts on
                my Sick-Bed,</title> depicts Dorothy imprisoned in her room at Rydal Mount. 
                The speaker, for whom walking outdoors has been such an important part of 
                life, now finds herself disabled. But, like Coleridge, she rejoices in the 
                creative powers that allow her to imagine that she is not confined, and 
                she ultimately refutes her entrapment. “I thought of Nature’s loveliest 
                scenes,” she concludes, “And with Memory I was there.” In “This
                Lime Tree Bower, my Prison,” Coleridge finds that neither nature nor his friends
                have deserted him, as he enjoys the capacity to traverse space in his mind’s eye,
                providing him much to delight and soothe him. For Dorothy, a gift of spring flowers,
                brought by friends, spurs the powers of her imagination and transports her beyond
                the four walls of her room:

               Dorothy claims in “Thoughts on my Sick-Bed” that there has been what her
               brother termed “abundant recompense” for what has been lost:

                  <p>In short, <title level="a">Thoughts on My Sick-Bed,</title> one of her most personal
                and meditative poems, is also arguably one of her best. It is also highly allusive, 
                as it gestures toward her brother’s and Coleridge’s poems in order to 
                underscore the fundamental shared argument about the powers of friendship, memory, 
                and the imagination, and to draw the poems, and the poets, together.
            </p>
                  <p>Perhaps the memory-poem most indebted to her brother and most grounded in their
               common life in the Lakes is <title level="a">Grasmere—A Fragment,</title> an
               undated poem that reflects on the siblings’ arrival in the village in December
               1799. It is a poem that, like her brother’s <title level="a">Home at Grasmere
               </title> (1800), reflects both on their return to the Lake District to establish a 
               home and on the meaning of home itself. Four versions of <title level="a">Grasmere
               —A Fragment,</title> all with revisions, are included in DCMS 120, suggesting
               it was important to Dorothy and part of a family dialogue about the meaning of their
               shared life. The poem describes a sense of deep satisfaction upon viewing Dove
               Cottage, which, “with its clustering trees / Summons [her] heart.” Although
               it is little more than a “shed,” modest in comparison to some neighboring
               homes, with no fertile fields but a rocky steep that rises behind, she declares, 
               “I love that house because it is / The very mountains’ child.”
            </p>
                  <p>The poem proceeds to describe the “lovely winter’s day” when the
               Wordsworths moved into Dove Cottage. Soon after arriving, Dorothy writes:

                This scene, in which Dorothy leaves her brother behind “to wander out alone,
                ” reflects her newfound autonomy, whereas the actual “little winding
                path” that leads her up the hills hints at the opportunities for walking
                and exploration soon to come. The poem also addresses the delight she finds in
                the wintery scenes on display:

                        But oh how imperfect is my pleasure! I am <emph>alone</emph>; why are not you seated with me? and 
                        my dear William why is not he here also? I could almost fancy that I see you both near me. I have 
                        chosen a bank where I have room to spare for a resting-place for each of you. I hear <emph>you</emph>

                        be the happiest of human beings. I see my Brother fired with the idea of leading his sister to such a 
                        retreat as Fancy ever ready at our call hastens to assist us in painting; our parlor is in a moment 
                        furnished; our garden is adorned by magic; the roses and honeysuckles spring at our command, the wood 
                        behind the house lifts at once its head and furnishes us with a winter’s shelter, and a summer’s noon-day 
                        shade. My dear friend I trust that ere long you will be, without the aid of imagination, the companion

               Dorothy did, of course, establish a household with her brother, and many of her poems
               celebrate visions of their home, at Dove Cottage until 1808 and at other residences
               until 1813, when they moved to Rydal Mount, where they would remain until their
               deaths.
            </p>
                  <p>In sum, readers of this edition will be confronted with many poems that describe the
                long life Dorothy enjoyed with her brother in Grasmere and Rydal; they will
                encounter multiple versions of many of these poems, and often variant readings
                within these versions. Our presentation reflects the textually indeterminate state
                of Dorothy’s writing and attempts to remain faithful to the nature and purpose of
                her poetic expression. We believe that her poems reward careful reading, both for
                what they can tell us about her life and for their own sake. They enhance and
                supplement our understanding of her prose writing. Above all, they give us a picture
                of an older woman of letters seeking to process her experiences in poetic forms.

                    II. Textual and Editorial Issues
                </head>
                  <p>DCMS 120 is a hardcover book with mottled brown paper boards, containing 89 leaves
                and measuring 276 mm (height) x 215 mm (width). As discussed previously, Dorothy
                enters most of the contents of the notebook from the front of the book, with the
                front being determined by the cover with a stationer’s label, and the last entry
                written on 59r. When opened and read in this direction, certain leaves or pages are
                blank (7v, 23, 25v, 26r, 33v, 35–36r, 41r, 42, 43r, 45v, 48v, 50, 51v, 57v, 59v,
                61–78), and some folios are stubs—that is, pages that have been cut or torn out (27,
                30, 34, 46, 46, 60). When opening the book from the other direction, the last piece
                of writing appears on 15v, with no blanks and one stub, on folio 8. There is no
                observable pattern that distinguishes material entered at either end, as both have
                Dorothy’s own poems along with copied material. There are 12 inserts—that is,
                materials extraneous to the notebook that have been pasted in. These inserts are
                both complete poems (by Dorothy and others, usually written out by others) as well
                as patches added to provide correct poems.
            </p>
                  <p>As noted, DCMS 120’s label (see fig. 6.1) survives to provide details about where it
                was purchased. It indicates that the book was bought at GRISET FILS AINÉ, a shop in
                Boulogne-Sur-Mer that Dorothy, William, and Mary Wordsworth visited in November 1820
                near the end of a Continental tour.
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors">In Boulogne, they were visiting DW’s friend Mary Barker, 
                        who two years earlier had been her climbing companion on Scafell Pike. On Barker, see 
                        <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.SP-intro.html">our introduction</ref> to DW’s account of that 
                        excursion.
                        </note>
                Part workbook for her verse, part poetic miscellany, part commonplace book, and part
                scrapbook, the notebook embodies what Margaret Ezell terms “messy” manuscript
                volumes, domestic literary artifacts that have been largely invisible to modern
                scholars precisely because of their refusal to conform to print norms.

               <byline>Edited by Michelle Levy, Nicholas Mason, and Paul Westover</byline>
               <div type="section">
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Editor’s note:</hi> Given the enduring norm in editions such as this of
                        presenting a writer’s works chronologically, Dorothy Wordsworth’s commonplace book
                        poems pose a challenge. Not only is it impossible to know whether the order in which the poems
                        appear in DCMS 120 corresponds with their order of composition, but we also have no means to
                        ascertain the precise temporal relationship between material copied into the opposite ends of the
                        notebook. Therefore, rather than attempt to order the poems by date or impose any single
                        organizational scheme upon a notebook that was never intended to reach the public, we
                        present here two models for working through the poems:</p>
                  <list type="unordered">
                     <item>
                        <hi rend="bold">Table of contents 1</hi> shows how, like the typical commonplace book,
                          DCMS 120 intermingles the author’s own creative work or personal reflections with
                          miscellaneous quotations, recipes, and extracts. This table therefore captures a core
                          feature of this notebook that gets obscured in our <ref target="editions.2022.DW.Poems.xml">
                          reading text</ref>, which transcribes only Dorothy’s original poems. It also highlights
                          the fact that this notebook is an ambigraph—or a book that begins on either end (see 
                          <ref target="editions.2020.DW.Poems-intro.xml">this section’s introduction</ref>)—by
                          dividing its contents into two parts. <hi rend="bold">Table 1A</hi> lists texts that appear
                          right-side up when one reads from the front cover. Conversely, <hi rend="bold">Table 1B</hi> 
                          lists those written in the other direction, and hence read by flipping the book over and 
                          beginning from the back cover.
                      </item>
                     <lb/>
                     <item>
                        <hi rend="bold">Table of contents 2</hi> instead lists just the poems, clustering together
                          different versions of the same text but otherwise presenting them in their order of appearance
                          in DCMS 120. Studying alternate versions of her poems offers a clearer understanding of both
                          the nature of Dorothy’s revisions and the types of poems she repeatedly reworked. While, for
                          ease in referencing, we have labeled variant texts according to their sequence in DCMS 120
                          (e.g., Version A, Version B, etc.), we caution against assuming earlier versions of poems
                          appear earlier in the notebook. Readers should also be aware that a degree of editorial
                          judgment has gone into grouping together texts, as some poems appearing under a single
                          title contain major variants. For example, <title level="a">Lines intended for my Niece’s Album</title> (12, 
                          13)—a poem Dorothy wrote for her namesake, Dora—was drafted or copied first into DCMS
                          120. It appears in both a 5-stanza and a 12-stanza version (with considerable differences
                          between the shared stanzas). These two versions exist because Dorothy marks the first
                          seven stanzas in the 12-stanza version (see fig. 6B.1) as “Not to be put in this album,”
                          a puzzling note in a poem that has been written explicitly for that purpose, especially
                          since the rejected stanzas contain no obviously unacceptable material. A similar gesture
                          is found in <title level="a">Lines intended for Edith Southey’s album,</title> in which
                          “Not intended for the Album” is penciled at the top of the second page of the poem.
                          What these notes about excisions suggest is that Dorothy was highly cognizant of the need to
                          modify her poems for different audiences, as her concern may have been that the poems would
                          have a wider circulation when copied in her niece’s and Edith’s albums. It also
                          suggests that she exercised control over who saw this manuscript notebook. We also find Dorothy
                          returning to some poems, especially <title level="a">Grasmere—A Fragment</title> (four
                          versions), <title level="a">Lines written (rather say begun)</title> (seven versions), and
                          <title level="a">Loving &amp; Liking</title> (three versions), repeatedly, revising 
                          various sections, sometimes only individual stanzas or lines. To say therefore that they are
                          “versions” of the same poem may, in some cases, be overstating the case.

               <p>Sick-bed Consolations composed during the Spring of the Year 1832.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">
                    This heading is composed on f.26v and is followed by a stub (f.27). Rachel 
                    Feder argues in <title level="a">The Experimental Dorothy Wordsworth</title>that Dorothy made an 
                    attempt to impose some coherence on the DCMS 120 notebook by creating within 
                    it a “collection of poetic ‘consolations’” (542). Referring to Dorothy’s 
                    inscription on f.26v, which she describes as a cover page, Feder claims,
                    
                    <quote>Dorothy Wordsworth copies out a small collection of poems, all pertaining 
                    to similar themes—death and rebirth, sickness and afterlife, prayer and 
                    natural patterns of change. . . . The chapbook that follows brings together 
                    a group of poems, or what Wordsworth calls “consolations,” and assigns them 
                    to an occasion of reading and an occasion of writing; in other words, it is 
                    the collection itself that is composed. What we have, then, is a book within 
                    a book—a collection of <title level="a">Sick-bed Consolations,</title> an occasional text with a 
                    social purpose—that is nested within a book of daily writing, and that cannot, 
                    literally or literarily, be removed from the commonplace book. In the collection 
                    following this cover page, the collection that I am calling the commonplace 
                    chapbook, the poems . . . are written (relatively) neatly and in matching ink, 
                    sharing not only topics, but also leaves of paper. (545)</quote>

                  <hi rend="bold">Dorothy’s Forgotten Diaries</hi>
                  <lb/>
                Despite Dorothy Wordsworth’s having long ago joined the pantheon of English diarists,
                her most sustained effort in the genre, the fifteen compact notebooks from 1824–35
                generally identified as the <title level="m">Rydal Journals</title> (<title level="m">RJ</title>), 
                remains largely unpublished and virtually unknown outside specialized academic circles. While
                several of the more striking passages from these journals have been referenced in the occasional
                biography or scholarly article, only one short segment—a three-week stretch chronicling her
                1828 trip to the Isle of Man—has appeared in its entirety.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">William Knight published the first two weeks of DW’s Isle of Man tour in his 1889 <title level="m">Life of William
                     Wordsworth</title> and later reprinted these excerpts in his 1897 edition of DW’s journals (Knight, <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>, 3:140–49; 
                     <hi rend="italic">KJ</hi>, 2:277–82). Two generations later, Ernest De Sélincourt included the entire tour in vol. 2 of <title level="m">DWJ</title>.
                     </note>
                Accordingly, this concluding section of <title level="m">Dorothy Wordsworth’s Lake 
                District</title> marks an important first step toward rectifying this problem, as it
                features complete transcriptions of the first and last volumes (Notebooks 1 and 15)
                of what proved to be the last great endeavor of Dorothy’s writing career.
            </p>
               <p>Paradoxically, one of Dorothy’s foremost champions, the early twentieth-century
                Oxford don Ernest De Sélincourt, is perhaps most culpable for consigning the
                <title level="m">RJ</title> to obscurity. For in both his landmark study of her life
                (1933) and his two-volume edition of her journals (1941), De Sélincourt categorically
                dismissed the <title level="m">RJ</title> as “eleven shabby little notebooks,”
                calling them “wholly capricious” in design and displaying “little of
                the character of the Alfoxden or Grasmere Journals.”
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Eight years after disparaging the <title level="m">RJ</title> in his 1933 biography, De
                     Sélincourt recycled many of his remarks verbatim in the introduction to <title level="m">DWJ</title> (<title level="m">DWB</title>,
                     368; <title level="m">DWJ</title>, 1: xviii–xix). A half-century later, his erroneous description of the
                     <title level="m">RJ</title> notebooks—which are, in fact, fifteen in number and remarkably well preserved—received
                     new life when, without citing their obvious source, Gittings and Manton described DW’s later diaries as “eleven worn
                     and shabby notebooks” (242).</note>
                To justify how, in a collection putatively featuring all of Dorothy’s journals, he
                included just a tiny fraction of the <title level="m">RJ</title>, he somewhat feebly
                asserted that the Isle of Man tour is “the only portion written in consecutive
                style, as a journal rather than a mere diary.”
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <title level="m">DWJ</title>, 1:xix.</note>
               </p>
               <p>While assertions like these have undoubtedly suppressed interest in the 
                <title level="m">RJ</title>, numerous researchers and enthusiasts have nonetheless
                made pilgrimages to Grasmere to study the original notebooks at the Wordsworth
                Trust. In the 1970s Carl Ketcham transcribed roughly 20% of the
                <title level="m">RJ</title> and then summarized his findings in a
                lengthy article published in <title level="m">The Wordsworth Circle</title>
                in 1978.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Ketcham, <title level="a">Dorothy Wordsworth’s Journals.</title> Ketcham’s partial transcription, which his
                     family donated to the Wordsworth Trust upon his passing in 1991, proved immensely helpful during the early stages of this project, when we were
                     still learning to decipher DW’s handwriting.</note>
                Where he, like many Wordsworthians of his generation, turned to Dorothy’s
                journals primarily for insights into the life and works of her famous brother,
                subsequent scholars have firmly reinstalled Dorothy at the center of the
                <title level="m">RJ</title> narrative. In an important 2015 article on
                <title level="a">Dorothy Wordsworth and Old Age,</title> for instance, Pamela Woof
                offered what was at the time the most thorough engagement with these later notebooks
                since Ketcham’s essay. And, in 2021, a pair of writers based three radically
                different books on the <title level="m">RJ</title>: a historical novel on Dorothy’s
                final years (Kathleen Winter’s <title level="m">Undersong</title>), a poetry 
                collection on themes of ageing and illness (Polly Atkin’s <title level="m">Much 
                with Body</title>), and an alternative biography incorporating perspectives from
                disability studies (Atkin’s <title level="m">Recovering Dorothy</title>).
            </p>
               <p>That, in order to write about the journals, each of these researchers had to
                independently copy out those portions that pertained to their interests underscores
                the need for a reliable and readily accessible transcription of all fifteen volumes
                of the <title level="m">RJ</title>. While such an undertaking is beyond the scope of
                this edition, we are excited to make available for the first time fully annotated
                and contextualized transcriptions of Notebooks 1 and 15. These bookend volumes of
                the <title level="m">RJ</title> cover dramatically different life stages, the one a
                period of robust health and the other of increasing infirmity. Yet they share both a
                setting (Rydal Mount and its environs) and an abiding emphasis on Dorothy’s love for
                the people and landscapes of her native region.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">While, as the name implies, nine volumes of the <title level="m">RJ</title> (Notebooks 1, 5–7, and 11–15)
                    are set in and around Rydal, the remaining six chronicle extended trips DW made in the late 1820s to the Midlands (Notebooks 2–4), Halifax (parts of
                    Notebooks 6 and 10), the Isle of Man (Notebook 8 and part of Notebook 9), and Leicestershire (much of Notebook 10).</note>
                Notebook 1 spans December 1824 through December 1825, capturing the daily routines of
                an unusually vibrant 53-year-old who clearly relished a new phase with fewer domestic
                responsibilities, relative financial security, and a large circle of friends within
                walking distance of home. Notebook 15, by contrast, chronicles a comparatively
                dispiriting six-month period of late 1834 and early 1835, when, having survived
                several recent brushes with death, Dorothy found her experience narrowed to her
                memories and what she could see or hear from her upstairs bedroom at Rydal Mount.

                  <hi rend="bold">The Text of the <title level="m">Rydal Journals</title>
                  </hi>
                  <lb/>
                The typical <title level="m">RJ </title>entry consists of three or four succinct,
                allusive, and fragmentary descriptions written in the slapdash hand that Dorothy 
                often called “my scrawl.” While full of compelling observations and
                vibrant descriptions, the <title level="m">RJ</title> are considerably more prone
                than the <title level="m">GJ</title> to lapsing into bare-bones accounts of the
                weather, the day’s events, and the health of Dorothy’s housemates.
                This “sparser” style of the later journals has prompted Lucy Newlyn to
                conjecture that their “main purpose was to serve as a rudimentary mnemonic
                device” or perhaps as a “mood-diary.”
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Newlyn, 271–72.</note>
                For his part, Ketcham discerns a subtle artistry in Dorothy’s “customary
                brevity,” remarking that the finest entries in the <title level="m">RJ</title>
                combine “a vivid, staccato
                impressionism with the awareness of underlying unity.“
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Ketcham, “Dorothy Wordsworth’s Journals,” 4. Woof has also repeatedly referenced the
                    “staccato” style of DW’s entries (<hi rend="italic">GJ</hi>, ix; <title level="a">Dorothy Wordsworth and Old
                    Age,</title> 157).</note>
               </p>
               <p>In keeping with her former practice, Dorothy typically composed several entries in
                one sitting rather than writing in her journal every night, and she continued to
                have no compunctions about using the same notebook as a journal, commonplace book,
                and expense ledger.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">For the mixed uses of DW’s earlier notebooks, see Woof, “Dorothy
                    Wordsworth’s Grasmere Journals,” 173–74. For the degree to which this was common practice during this era,
                    see Bellanca, <title level="m">Daybooks of Discovery</title>, 11–14.</note>
                Yet, whereas the <title level="m">GJ</title> was explicitly written for her brother
                William and a few close friends and relations, the <title level="m">RJ</title> seem
                to have been intended solely for Dorothy’s own benefit. Alternations and emendations
                in these journals consistently appear in the same shade of ink and quality of pen as the
                original entry, suggesting that Dorothy almost invariably corrected her prose as she
                wrote rather than in some later round of dedicated revision. In consequence, this
                section varies from other parts of this edition in only noting those textual
                variants or irregularities that might offer fresh perspectives into Dorothy’s
                writing process. Above all, our priority has been to provide clean and accurate
                transcriptions that faithfully preserve Dorothy’s final wording, spelling, and
                punctuation.

               <p>After countless passes through the original manuscripts, we have become sufficiently
                familiar with Dorothy’s handwriting, diction, and orthography to now be able to
                offer confident transcriptions of over 95% of the text. Where our transcription
                remains tentative, we enclose the elusive word or phrase in editorial brackets and
                add a question mark (e.g., [night?]). If unable or unwilling to hazard a tentative
                transcription, we use an empty set of editorial brackets ([ ]) to mark each
                illegible word. Dorothy’s idiosyncratic punctuation poses a different set of
                challenges, as she routinely omits apostrophes in possessives (e.g., “Marys
                book”), treats line breaks as a substitute for end punctuation, and does little to
                distinguish her short dashes from her commas and periods. While careful to retain
                her punctuation, we have provided clarifying punctuation marks, always placing them
                inside editorial brackets (e.g., Mary[’]s book), as needed.
            </p>
               <p>Since even a clean transcription of the
                <title level="m">RJ</title> can be opaque without some knowledge of the people,
                places, and events being described, we preface both notebooks with a
                brief introduction and an extensive biographical index covering individuals who
                appear most frequently therein. And within the text of the journals, we supply
                scores of hypertext annotations in hopes of helping readers have an even more
                engaging experience with Dorothy’s remarkable accounts of life in Rydal 
                in the 1820s and 1830s.</p>

               <head>7. Introduction to Notebook 1 of the <title level="m">Rydal Journals</title>

                  <p>Contrary to the lingering notion that the <title level="m">Rydal Journals</title> 
                (<title level="m">RJ</title>) are, above all, a chronicle of Dorothy Wordsworth’s
                inexorable, decade-long slide into infirmity and senescence, the first nine of its
                15 notebooks capture the tireless comings and goings of a hale and hearty
                50-something relishing a new stage of life with fewer household duties and relative
                financial security. At various points in 1825, the year when she completed her first
                <title level="m">RJ</title> notebook (DCMS 104.1), Dorothy told
                one friend, “When the air is clear I can walk nine or ten miles or more with as
                little fatigue as ever I did in my life” and another that she could “walk as well as
                when but twenty years old, and can climb the hills better than in those days.”
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">DW to
                            Elizabeth Crump, late April 1825 (<title level="m">Letters</title>,
                            4:339); DW to Robert Jones, 7 October 1825 (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 4:387).
                    </note>
                If anything, the first several volumes of the <title level="m">RJ</title> log 
                proportionally fewer days when Dorothy was confined to a sickbed than her 
                <title level="m">Grasmere Journal</title>
                from a quarter-century before. Until her first major health crisis in the spring of
                1829, only heavy rain and occasional aches and pains kept the middle-aged writer
                from spending her days wandering the Westmorland fells and her nights socializing
                among an ever-widening circle of friends.
            </p>
                  <p>Like her brother William and sister-in-law Mary, Dorothy grew increasingly prone to
                wanderlust as the three surviving Wordsworth children came of age during the 1820s.
                Just how disencumbered she had become by 1825 is suggested by a letter explaining
                that what was supposed to be a week-long trip to see 
                <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-1-reading.html#Cookson">the Cooksons</ref> 
                in Kendal had stretched to a fortnight because her friends begged
                her to stay, and, “having no particular object to call [her] home, [she] could not
                refuse.”
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">DW to Joanna Hutchinson, 13 February 1825

                    </note>
                While her ultimate travel dream was to take another trip
                to the Continent,
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">DW to H. C. Robinson, 12 April 1825 (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 4:337), 2 July 1825 (4:373), and 26
                        November 1825 (4:405–06). Originally planned for 1827, this second
                        Continental tour never came to fruition.
                    </note>
                she settled in
                the meantime for extended excursions in the British Isles, including a seven-week
                tour of Scotland with 
                <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-1-reading.html#Joanna">Joanna Hutchinson</ref> in the fall of 1822, a
                10-month stay with family and friends in the Midlands in 1826, and a trip with
                William to the Isle of Man in the summer of 1828.
            </p>
                  <p>All of this travel in surrounding years makes Notebook 1 something of an outlier, as
                Dorothy spent the entire year it covers (11 December 1824–9 December 1825) in anchor
                at Rydal Mount. Not that her 1825 was entirely devoid of holidays, however, as we
                find her taking several multiday trips throughout the Lakes. For many readers, in
                fact, the highlight of Notebook 1 will be her entries for 5–8 July 1825, which break
                from her typical just-the-facts style to describe in vivid detail each leg of a
                four-day excursion across the region’s southern peninsulas. The expansive,
                keen-eyed, and witty style of these entries brings to mind sections of Dorothy’s
                travel narratives from Scotland and the Continent.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">The full text of DW’s 1803 and 1822 tours
                        of Scotland and her 1820 tour of the Continent are included in <title level="m">DWJ</title>.
                    </note>
                Perhaps even closer parallels, though, can be found in the shorter accounts she made of her
                <ref target="editions.2022.DW.ulls-intro">1805 “Excursion on the Banks of Ullswater”</ref> and
                <ref target="editions.2022.DW.SP-intro">1818 “Excursion up Scawfell Pike.”</ref> Considering 
                the stylistic similarities between the 5–8 July
                entries and these two “excursions” and the fact that the Ullswater and Scawfell
                accounts had recently appeared—albeit with no acknowledgment of her authorship—in
                new editions of William’s <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title>,
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">In 1822, WW used DW’s Scafell Pike excursion to

                it seems entirely possible that
                Dorothy composed this distinctive segment of Notebook 1 in anticipation of her
                brother’s wanting to include a third Lake District “excursion” in some later edition
                of his guidebook.
                <note place="foot" resp="editors">DW never appears to have returned to her 5–8 July
                         entries to expand them into a proper “excursion,” but this may have been
                         owing to the unexpected gap between the fourth (1823) and fifth (1835)
                         editions of the <title level="m">Guide</title>. By the time WW began
                         working in earnest on the 1835 edition, DW lacked the requisite stamina
                         for this sort of intensive writing project.

                  </p>
                  <p>All other sections of Notebook 1 chronicle daily rhythms and routines at Rydal Mount,
                offering an affecting portrait of Dorothy’s devotion to her closest family and
                friends and a clear window into the lives of the middle-aged Wordsworths and, more
                generally, the provincial English gentry of this period. Within the first few pages,
                it becomes clear that this was an unusually convivial period for Dorothy. Just how
                much of a social butterfly she had become was captured by <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-1-reading.html#SH">Sara
                Hutchinson</ref>, who, upon returning to Rydal in August 1825 after a two-year
                absence, reported finding “dear Dorothy as well and active as ever—&amp; a knott of
                good friends around her—so that we are in no want of society which would have been
                no <hi rend="underline">loss</hi> on my first arrival.”
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">SH to John Monkhouse, 7 August
                        1825 (WT MS WLL / Hutchinson, Sara / 2 / 110a).
                    </note>
                Functioning as something of a hub for her “knott of good friends,” she inspired
                intimates like <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-1-reading.html#Luff">Letitia Luff </ref>and 
                <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-1-reading.html#Harrison"> “Cousin Dorothy” Harrison</ref> 
                to relocate to the environs of Rydal
                and frequently brought together old neighbors, distant cousins, and respectable new
                arrivals to the area. Just how few social niceties stood between her and her closest
                female friends is suggested by entries like that of 26 July 1825, in which she
                records how on this “loveliest of nights” she “called on Mrs Luff in her Bed-room –
                past 10.”
            </p>
                  <p>Throughout Notebook 1, Dorothy mixes freely with young and old alike, displaying a
                particular relish for playing the surrogate aunt to the grown Cookson, Coleridge,
                and Southey children, whom she had known since their childhoods, and new favorites
                like <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-1-reading.html#Jewsbury">Maria Jane Jewsbury</ref> 
                and the <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-1-reading.html#Dowling">Dowling sisters</ref>. 
                Unlike her letters from the mid-1820s, in which she frequently
                rails against radicals and reformers, the <title level="m">RJ</title> show Dorothy to
                be thoroughly ecumenical in her choice of friends, with her inner circle ranging
                beyond orthodox Anglicans and Tories to incorporate progressives like 
                <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-1-reading.html#Barber">Samuel Barber</ref> and the

                Presbyterians (Mary Honeyman and <ref target="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-1-reading.html#Harden">the Hardens</ref>).

                Her 1825 diary may, in
                fact, reveal flickering embers of her youthful republicanism. For, not only do we
                repeatedly see her socializing with working folk in ways women of her rank would
                never seem to imagine in the contemporary novels of Jane Austen, but we even catch
                her commiserating with a Windermere ferryman about how “all the Land” above the lake
                . . . had been “divided among the Gentry” and opining that the surrounding hills
                would be considerably “more cheerful” if “scattered over with houses” of ordinary
                    Dalesmen.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">

                  </p>
                  <p>Similarly compelling moments elsewhere in this first volume of the <title level="m">RJ</title> 
                capture the range and breadth of Dorothy’s reading and her enduring
                bonds with her brother, his family, and the natural wonders of the Lakes. And,
                especially through the lists of expenditures and favorite Bible verses she kept
                inside its front and back covers, we gain a deeper and more nuanced understanding of
                Dorothy’s sensibilities, both spiritual and material, than even the fullest
                biography provides. All told, then, however succinct and weather-obsessed the
                journal entries may be for pages at a time, those reading this edition’s
                transcription of Notebook 1 will find in it a consistently engaging and frequently
                illuminating portrait of a year in the life of one of the most fascinating figures
                of Britain’s Romantic age.

                brother, with whom she had shared a home since 1795. In his mid-fifties, WW’s
                literary reputation and audience were still steadily expanding, and he continued to
                write new poems and rework old ones, including the revisions to 
                <title level="m">The Excursion</title> chronicled in Notebook 1.

                Although chronic eye pain often made it
                difficult for him to read and DW remarked in 1825 that he was “much thinner than he
                used to be, and this makes him look old,” the poet generally remained as hale and
                hearty as his sister.

                Beyond his literary
                commitments, WW devoted considerable energy during this period to his duties as
                Distributor of Stamps for Westmorland and his extensive engagement with local and
                national politics.

                who before meeting her husband had been DW’s friend when they were teenagers in
                Penrith. Like the other adults in her household, MW was increasingly prone to
                wanderlust as her children came of age, and for much of the 1820s she, DW, and SH
                essentially alternated being on duty at RM while the others traveled. With it being
                DW’s turn to stay at home in 1825, MW spent most of that summer and fall with
                friends and family at Kents Bank on the Cartmel Peninsula, Harrogate spa in
                Yorkshire, and Coleorton Hall in Leicestershire. Accordingly, she appears less
                frequently in Notebook 1 than in many subsequent sections of the

                eldest child of WW and MW who, while less spirited than his younger siblings and
                less brilliant than his childhood companions Hartley and Sara Coleridge, was a
                dutiful son and kindhearted brother and nephew. Any expectations that he would
                follow his father’s and uncle Christopher’s path to Cambridge were foiled by John’s
                struggles with mathematics, a subject emphasized more heavily there than at other
                universities. Accordingly, in 1823, WW used family connections to secure his son’s
                admission to New College, Oxford.
                    <note place="foot" resp="food"> Barker, 559–60.</note> 
                While John was still
                enrolled, his parents kept him at home for much of 1825 owing to a reported typhus
                outbreak at Oxford. This left him largely carefree, and DW’s journal suggests he
                spent much of his time both with old friends and with Fanny Barlow, a pretty young
                heiress who arrived in the area in early 1825.

                WW and
                MW’s second child and only surviving daughter, whom Hartley Coleridge described in
                1824 as “a very pleasing girl—simple and affectionate; uniting her Aunt Sarah’s
                shrewdness to her mother’s gentleness.”

                After spending part of 1823–24
                working in Ambleside as a teacher at the Dowlings’ school, Dora moved back to RM,
                where, when healthy, she helped her mother and aunts with household chores and her
                father compose letters and copy poems. For much of the decade covered by the 
                <title level="m">RJ</title>, her chronic illnesses dominated the family’s domestic
                routines and travel schedules. In the summer of 1825, for instance, the Wordsworths
                spent two months at a rental home at Kents Bank on Morecambe Bay largely for her
                health. In the short term, the rest and sea air appear to have helped, as during
                this vacation a revitalized Dora formed the most intense attachment of her young
                life with the family’s new friend Jane Jewsbury.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors"> The depth and immediacy of Dora’s attachment to

                caught the eye of Lt. Tom Robinson, a distant cousin spending his shore leave at his
                brother’s home in Ambleside. In general, DW remained characteristically discrete
                about this budding relationship, but, if there is any prevailing theme to the final

                of 1825.

                expecting much happiness” in life and, heeding his father’s advice, accepted a
                teaching job at his old school in Ambleside.

                Seeing him for the first
                time in years, a startled DW opined in 1822 that he was “the oddest looking creature

                Hartley ultimately spent
                five unfulfilling years at the school, frequently snubbing invitations from the
                Wordsworths while lamenting being stuck in a place where “I have hardly an

                Coleridge’s sister, Edith Southey. In her early twenties, the younger Sara was
                already establishing a reputation for literary genius, publishing two acclaimed
                translations—the first of a history of Paraguay (1822) and the second of the
                adventures of Chevalier Bayard of France (1825)—with the leading publisher John

                During the year covered by

                affectionate relationship with the Southeys and an increasingly warm relationship
                with the Wordsworths. After the Coleridges spent a fortnight at RM in April 1825, DW
                reflected, “Adversity is the best school, I believe, for the best of us; and poor
                Mrs Coleridge has had enough of it, in the shape of humiliation and disappointed
                hopes concerning the talents of her Sons.” And of the daughter, she wrote, “Dear
                Sara is a sweet creature, so thoughtful and gentle, patient and persevering—and in
                conversation not disputatious as she used to be.”

                housekeeper at Ivy Cottage fretting that she would “have some trouble with the new
                Tenants” and MW spreading advance reports that Mrs. Elliott was “a fine 
                <emph>stately woman</emph>” who “expected to find in the Cottage the
                accommodations of a stately Mansion.”

                Such anxieties were soon
                dispelled, however, by the new arrivals’ generosity and conviviality, and the
                Wordsworths quickly came to rely on both their company and newspaper subscriptions.
                Just days before the start of Notebook 1, the Elliotts vacated Ivy Cottage and took
                temporary accommodations in Ambleside. Thereafter they spent much of 1825 in
                Devonshire with friends before returning to the area that autumn.

                <title level="m">Phantasmagoria</title>, to WW in early 1825, began a correspondence with the poet
                that quickly blossomed into an intimate friendship with the entire family at RM.
                Miss Jewsbury, or Jane to her close friends, spent most of her most of her
                adolescence in Leicestershire, where her father, Thomas (1767–1840), ran a series of
                only moderately successful textile mills. Seeking a fresh start, he moved his family
                to Manchester in 1818 and found work selling cotton goods and fire insurance. A year
                later, however, tragedy struck, when his wife, Maria (née Smith, 1778–1819), died
                shortly after delivering their seventh child, leaving the then-19-year-old Jane
                responsible for raising her younger siblings. Despite these heavy domestic
                obligations and her often debilitating chronic sicknesses, Jewsbury began regularly
                contributing to the
                <title level="m">Manchester Gazette </title>in 1821, and by the
                mid-1820s she seemed poised to join the likes of Letitia Landon, Caroline Bowles,
                and Felicia Hemans in the vanguard of English “poetesses.” Upon first meeting this
                vivacious young writer in the spring of 1825, DW called her “a young woman of
                extraordinary talents, . . . a good Daughter, a good Sister to a numerous Family at
                the head of which she was left.”

                The admiration was mutual,
                as later that year, while confiding a fear of growing old to Dora, Jewsbury mused,
                “if I could age like your Aunt W – &amp; unite green vigour with grey maturity, it
                were well – but who is like her?”

                Little is known about either of the Luffs’ backgrounds
                except that she seems to have come from London and he, according to DW, was “ruined
                by a bad education and early indulgence with the prospect of an independent and
                large fortune.”

                        was 96—indicates she was born in Lancashire. The only known marriage record
                        matching their names is for a union solemnized in London on 27 February 1812
                        between a Charles Luff and a Letitia Morris. While this date roughly
                        corresponds with when the couple passed through London en route to
                        Mauritius, it would mean they posed as husband and wife for over a decade

                By late 1811, however,
                their financial situation had become so dire that they were forced to decamp for

                England with these friends in early 1818, she spent most of the next seven years at
                the Farquhars’ London townhouse and at Playford Hall, the Suffolk estate of her old
                Ullswater friends Thomas and Catherine Clarkson.

                By WW’s account, after even a short tenure in Mauritius, Mr. Luff
                “left enough behind him to make his Widow independent,” and in early 1825 Mrs. Luff
                used this inheritance to buy her new Loughrigg residence, Fox Ghyll, and begin the
                ambitious renovations and expansions that for years to come would baffle her frugal
                friends at RM.

                Their sluggish departure from RM—despite knowing that the new tenants, the

                        comparatively poor cousins, insisting, “Tom Robinson finds Rydal so

                he made his case in writing to WW. The poet responded “instantly” and decisively,
                thanking his relation for being forthright but bluntly refusing permission on the

                widow whose husband, Richard (1782–1820), had been the Wordsworths’ physician from
                the time he opened his practice in 1808 until his death in 1820. DW held the late
                Mr. Scambler in great affection, especially after his valiant but futile efforts to
                save WW and MW’s infant daughter Catherine in 1812, when she assured MW and WW, “If
                you had seen Mr Scambler – if you had seen the humility, the tenderness, the
                watchfulness with which he administered the medicines – if you had heard him speak
                with the calm confidence and satisfaction that <emph>we</emph> did you
                would have been satisfied.”

                His unexpected death left
                his wife and nine children largely destitute, and DW’s journals show the women of RM
                making regular charitable visits to Walton Cottage, the Scamblers’ Ambleside home.
                The family would remain in the area until 1838, when, by MW’s report, Mrs. Scambler,
                her daughter Elizabeth, “and all the rest of them, poor things, including a
                grandchild” left “Ambleside, bag and baggage.”

                Samuel Taylor Coleridge had married Edith’s older sister Sarah. Since 1803 the
                Southeys and Coleridges had lived together at Greta Hall in Keswick, with the former
                helping to compensate for the financial and emotional support that was increasingly
                unforthcoming from Mrs. Coleridge’s husband. Despite being routinely linked together
                in the public mind, Southey and WW were more rivals than friends for the first
                decade of their acquaintance, especially after Southey published a withering review
                of <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> in 1798. DW initially shared her brother’s
                disdain, believing Southey showed “nothing of the dignity or enthusiasm of the
                Poet’s Character”; but her opinion was irrevocably changed in 1805 by his
                compassionate response to her brother John’s tragic death, as he “was so tender and
                kind that I loved him all at once – he wept with us in our sorrow, and for that
                cause I think I must always love him.”

                Over ensuing decades the

                older and younger generations regularly exchanging visits lasting between a few
                hours and several weeks. Five of the Southeys’ eight children survived through 1825,
                but only two, <hi rend="bold">Bertha (1809–77, age 16)</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Kate
                (1810–64, age 15)</hi>, appear in Notebook 1. In the autumn of 1825 these
                teenaged girls spent two weeks at RM with DW, SH, and their friend Dora, and
                afterward DW called them both “delightful girls” but singled out Bertha as “an
                especial favourite of mine.”

                After meeting him through their mutual friends the Clarksons in 1809, DW wrote that
                “we liked Mr Tillbrook very much for his unaffected manners,” but, presumably
                alluding to his laboring-class roots, she also noted “a coarseness, a want of polish
                about him which might be smoothed away with advantage.”

                Eight years later, as a
                confirmed bachelor in his mid-thirties, Tillbrook bought Ivy Cottage at the bottom
                of Rydal Hill. Since his commitments at Peterhouse precluded inhabiting the house
                for much of the year, he typically leased it out, and over time several of his
                tenants—including the Quillinans, Gees, and Elliotts—became intimates of the
                Wordsworths. While Tillbrook himself developed a cordial relationship with his
                neighbors, he never became as close to WW as he was to Robert Southey.

                    widow of Richard Watson, Bishop of Llandaff (1737–1816, <ref target="https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/28857">DNB</ref>), of Calgarth Hall near Bowness.
                The late bishop had been a towering figure on the national stage, earning separate
                reputations as a Cambridge chemist, “improving” agriculturalist, Whig politician,
                and liberal prelate.

                After retiring to Calgarth in the
                1790s, this favorite son of the region quickly became, by De Quincey’s account, “the
                leading person about the Lakes, as regarded rank and station.”

                    </note> 
                If anything, the bishop’s wife had an even more elite
                Westmerian pedigree, being the granddaughter of Sir William Fleming of Rydal Hall on
                her mother’s side and the long-time MP Daniel Wilson of Dallam Tower on her
                father’s. After her husband’s passing in 1816, Mrs. Watson remained at Calgarth with
                her five unmarried daughters: <hi rend="bold">Dorothy (1777–1831, age 48), Harriet 
                (1779–1835, age 46), Elizabeth (1780–1859, age 45), Charlotte (1783–1859, age 
                42), </hi>and<hi rend="bold" xml:space="preserve"> Mary (1785–1847, age 40)</hi>.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors"> The lives of these
                        spinster sisters were not altogether devoid of romance, however, as in 1812
                        the eldest, Dorothy, provided fodder for local gossips by carrying on a
                        romantic intrigue with John Christian Curwen, a Windermere grandee who,
                        besides being married and twenty years her senior, was one of her father’s
                        closest friends. Gleefully reporting this “scandalam magnatum” to a friend,
                        Southey noted that Curwen “confesses to impudence but vows &amp; protests
                        innocence as to any thing farther.” To this, Southey spitefully added that Miss
                        Watson’s “beauty affords about as much excuse as his youth &amp;
                        inexperience” (<ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/southey_letters/Part_Four/HTML/letterEEd.26.2169.html">

                While the Watsons and Wordsworths rarely
                interacted during the bishop’s lifetime, they became increasingly friendly
                thereafter, partly as a reflecting of the Wordsworths’ increasing standing both in
                the community and beyond. The <title level="m">RJ</title> show the families exchanging
                visits a few times each year, and DW noted in a February 1826 letter that “at Rydal
                we get no new publications except through Southey – and sometimes from the Watsons
                of Calgarth (the Bishop’s Daughters).”

                Storm – wind rain flood – Chapel opened – Water falls
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">The Christmas Day opening of the
                            new chapel Lady Ann le Fleming had erected in Rydal was spoiled by
                            torrential rain. Dora wrote, “I never was out in such a storm, nor does
                            my Father ever remember experiencing so violent a one” 
                            (<ref target="https://tinyurl.com/mr356d7e">WLL / Wordsworth, Dora / 1 / 6</ref>). WW groused of the new chapel
                            that “the cost . . . much exceeded what was needful” but conceded that
                            “when time has softened down the exterior a little it will prove a great
                            ornament to the Village” (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 4:301). MW
                            considered it “a great monument to the Village,” despite “all the
                            blunders that have been made by the ignorance of the Builders” 
                            (<title level="m">LMW</title>, 120). Less equivocally, DW rejoiced that
                            Rydal was “beautified by our new Chapel which is a great comfort to us”
                            <title level="m">Letters</title>, 4:396).

                        of Moral Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. Among WW’s earliest
                         disciples, Wilson bought the Elleray estate near Bowness in his early
                            twenties largely for its proximity to his literary icon. For a decade
                            thereafter the Wilsons and Wordsworths enjoyed a close bond, but it was
                            severely strained after Wilson began publishing alternately admiring and
                            satirical <title level="m">Blackwood’s</title> articles on the “Lake
                            Poets” in 1817. Wilson’s inclusion in this outing therefore marked a
                            rare moment of rapprochement between the former friends.

                            chronicle of DW’s four-day excursion to the Cartmel Peninsula is by far
                            the most detailed section of Notebook 1. For the journey’s initial
                            eight-mile leg RM to Coniston village, DW traveled by cart with WW, MW,
                            Letitia Luff, Eliza Dowling, and a Miss Woodville. Then, while the rest
                            of the party continued on by cart, DW and Henry Hutchinson (whom they
                            met in Coniston) traveled five miles by foot and boat to his summer
                            rental on Coniston Water. Thereafter details about her travel companions
                            are fuzzy, but at least WW and MW appear to have accompanied her on the
                            ten-mile cart ride to the Lund, Benson Harrison’s family home in
                            Ulverston, where they spent the night.

               <p>When, in October 1834, Dorothy Wordsworth began what would prove the last volume of
                her <title level="m">Rydal Journals</title> (<hi rend="italic">RJ</hi>), she already
                seemed on borrowed time, having repeatedly been on deathwatch since falling
                seriously ill in April 1829. Her survival was, in part, a testament to the devoted
                care of her physician, Thomas Carr, and her family, including her brother William,
                whose daily routine in 1833 included reading to her, massaging her swollen feet, and,
                weather permitting, wheeling her into the garden (fig. 1).

                While Dorothy’s condition was no longer critical during the six-month span (October
                1834–April 1835) at the center of Notebook 15, she remained largely confined to her
                upstairs bedroom at Rydal Mount.</p>

               <p>The prevailing norm for interpreting—or, perhaps more accurately, disregarding—the
                 two decades between the close of the <hi rend="italic">RJ</hi> in 1835 and Dorothy’s
                death in 1855 was established by Ernest De Sélincourt in 1933, when he asserted that
                “the last twenty years of posthumous life . . . only belong to the biography of
                Dorothy Wordsworth in so far as they reveal in fitful gleams something of what she
                once had been.”

                     <title level="m">DWB</title>, 394.</note> 
                While subsequent biographers have devoted more space to diagnosing Dorothy’s 
                medical condition—variously speculating that suffered from gallstones, arteriosclerosis,
                “pre-senile dementia of a type similar to Alzheimer’s disease,” or “depressive
                pseudo-dementia, a condition in which severe depression mimics the symptoms of dementia.”
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Newlyn, 275; Gittings, 271, 282–83; Wilson, 
                    <title level="m">Ballad of Dorothy Wordsworth</title>, 281.</note>
                —they have largely followed De Sélincourt’s lead in taking the period covered
                by Notebook 15 as a harrowing transition into Dorothy’s “posthumous life.” 
                With growing sensitivity in literary studies toward ageing and disability, however, this pattern might be
                changing. Polly Atkin’s recent book <hi rend="italic">Recovering Dorothy</hi>
                (2021), in particular, offers an overdue corrective to the longstanding impulse to
                dismiss her final decades. Noting how “Dorothy Wordsworth’s biographers have had a
                peculiar predilection for killing her long before her death,” Atkin sets out “to
                shine a light into the darkness and restore the rest of Dorothy’s narrative.” Quite
                simply, she insists, Dorothy “did not die, emotionally or otherwise, until 1855. She
                did not vanish. She was not undone. She may have changed, as we all do, in sickness
                and in health, but she was still Dorothy.”
                 <note place="foot" resp="editors">Atkin, <title level="m">Recovering Dorothy</title>, 6, 8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Of course, there is no disputing that Dorothy’s health was never again as robust
                after she was stricken with cholera or some other disease in early 1829; and, if
                read in isolation, Notebook 15 might be taken as proof of her gradual physical and
                mental decline. Shaky handwriting, ink spills, crossings-out, and basic errors
                proliferate as the volume draws to a close, and signs of what seems an increasingly
                circumscribed and dreary existence appear at every turn. On the “dull, dark &amp;
                cold” tenth day of February 1835, for instance, Dorothy writes, “My limbs unusually
                weak. With difficulty I went to window &amp; back.” A month later, on 15 March, she
                laments, “The greatest evil attending my present disordered state is that I can read
                or work little or none.” For every simple pleasure, such as her “companion 
                Robin,” the bird who frequents her windowsill throughout the autumn of 1834, there seems
                a counterbalancing threat, like the new cat at Rydal Mount that leaves Dorothy in terror about
                the bird’s safety.</p>
               <p>Seemingly further support for a narrative of steady decline comes in Dorothy’s
                concluding entry of 4 November 1835. Since having last written in her journal on 19
                April, she had grown too “dreadfully weak and languid” to write, and her mental
                health had further plummeted after the shock of Sara Hutchinson’s sudden passing on
                23 June.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <title level="m">Letters</title>, 6:51, 78.</note> 
                Yet, resolved to return to her decade-long habit of recording her daily activities, she
                “[took] up the pen once again.” The pathos of the final entry that follows emanates,
                in part, from its inaccuracies—she gives the year as 1815 (not 1835) and seems to have 
                been confused about her nephew John’s recent whereabouts—and also from its ending
                with the double negative “Dora not unwell,” as if asserting that to be “not
                unwell” is all one might reasonably hope for in this life (see fig. 2). The most 
                heartbreaking aspect of this entry, however, is its isolation on the journal’s last page,
                as, after having mustered the strength to resume her journal, Dorothy could eke out but a single
                entry before needing to set it aside for good.</p>

               <p>Writing in his own journal two months later, Dorothy’s friend Henry Crabb Robinson
                would attest to the severity of her physical decline. Two years had passed since
                Robinson’s last visit to Rydal, and he was obviously rattled to find on 2 January
                1836 that, even in what was said to be “her best state,” Dorothy paid little heed to
                his presence and “went on repeating without intermission fragments of poetry—her
                brother’s, Cowper’s, Dr. Watts’s—then repeating the Doxology, and the most
                melancholy act of all, carried away by the association of ideas, repeating the Amen
                in a loud tone and mocking a clerk accompanied by loud laughter.”
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">Robinson, <title level="m">Henry Crabb Robinson on
                        Books</title>, 2:477.</note> 
                Were one to stop reading there, this might seem unimpeachable proof of her ongoing deterioration;
                but continuing just a few pages further, we find Robinson rejoicing on 31 January at
                having found her “much calmer and reasonable.” Dorothy “sang some of her brother’s
                poems,” he reports, and “she evidently knew me, and was not irrational in anything
                she said.”

                    Crabb Robinson on Books</title>, 2:487.</note>
               </p>
               <p>That this was not merely a momentary rebound is suggested by a remarkably lucid and
                witty letter that Dorothy sent Christopher Wordsworth Jr. a few weeks after
                Robinson’s visit. Playfully greeting her 28-year-old nephew as a “public Orator”
                often summoned “to speak in the presence of Kings, Princes and Bishops,” she
                explains she is writing because Christopher’s “uncle, the Poet of the Lakes, has
                been deputed” to speak at the groundbreaking for a new seminary, but “alas! the poet
                is no Orator and he knows not what to say on this important occasion.” Rushing to
                her brother’s aid, she merrily entreats her nephew, as “the first Orator of the
                Nation,” to “make a speech for [William] which I will answer for it he will
                pronounce verbatim.” Dorothy concludes by announcing her intention “to see you all
                at Cambridge in summer,” sanguinely reporting, “I have got through a mighty
                struggle, and thank God am now as well as ever I was in my life except that I have
                not recovered the use of my legs. My Arms have been active enough as the torn caps
                of my nurses and the heavy blows I have given their heads and faces will
                testify.”

               </p>
               <p>Clearly, then, as Pamela Woof has written, “even in these final years there was more
                than imbecility to Dorothy Wordsworth; there are glimpses of what De Quincey calls
                her ‘very originality’ . . . in the later letters, verses and journals.”
                 <note place="foot" resp="editors">Woof, <title level="a">Dorothy Wordsworth and Old Age,</title> 175.</note>
                Recognizing as much offers an important check upon any temptation to
                reduce the whole of Notebook 15 to a tale of her physical and mental slide. It
                invites us to balance Dorothy’s recurring complaints over the deaths of several dear
                friends, her own debilitating maladies, and dispiriting political news from
                Westminster with other moments when she exudes her trademark optimism and zest for
                life. The series of entries she wrote as 1834 rolled over into 1835, for instance,
                are among the most affecting and exuberant in the whole of the <title level="m">RJ</title>. 
                In her entry for 30 December, she describes how “W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi> came to me
                rejoiced to hear thickly pattering rain after so long a pause – I could not but feel
                a touch of sympathy with him in remembrance of many a moist tramp; but sh[oul]d have been
                better pleased with bright moon &amp; stars, &amp; our late splendid evenings &amp; mornings.”
                Two days later, after noting the “Lovely sun-rise &amp; set,” she rhapsodizes,
                “Never surely in the 63 years that I have lived can there have been such brilliant
                New-years &amp; Christmas days.” And, in the same elevated strain, she writes on 2
                January, “Another year begun! and what a brilliant sun-rise – Oh! that men’s
                hearts could be <hi rend="underline">softened</hi>! – then elevated by the goodness &amp;
                beauty of all that is done for &amp; spread before us!”</p>
               <p>Elsewhere, Notebook 15 paints a portrait of long days and nights in a sickroom,
                where, when well enough, Dorothy read newspapers and religious books, made rugs for
                friends, and welcomed visits from well-wishers. While the entries at the start of
                this volume show her reading voraciously, her stamina had waned by February 1835 to
                the point that she had become reliant on her goddaughter (and regular companion)
                Ebba Hutchinson reading to her aloud. Wary, no doubt, of the addiction that had
                plagued her friends Coleridge and De Quincey, Dorothy took to assiduously logging
                each time she opened a new bottle of laudanum, and—in what should prove a remarkable
                trove for historians of medicine—she details treatments including the bleeding and
                blistering regimens endured by her niece Dora and her own use of Morrison’s Pills,
                arrowroot biscuits, and divers concoctions prepared by her faithful attendant Mr.
                Carr. Especially amid the political tumult surrounding the general election of early
                1835, Dorothy’s mood seems to have risen and fallen depending of how successful the
                Tories had been in staving off Whig offensives. Such is the case near the end of
                Notebook 15, when, in her entry for 30 March 1835, she initially expresses pleasure that
                the Wordsworths’ new neighbor Dr. Thomas Arnold would be bringing to his family to
                the Lakes for Easter before remembering that the last visit of this “active zealous
                Doctor” had been “to vote for a Destructive Member” in the parliamentary
                election—a trip that, as she wryly and triumphantly notes, was “Happily not
                successful.”</p>

                DW’s elder brother, with whom she had made a home since both were in their mid-twenties.
                In 1834–35 WW was weighed down by his sister’s and daughter’s illnesses,
                his own chronic eye pain, his growing anxiety about the state of the nation, and the recent
                deaths of several close friends, including Walter Scott, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Charles Lamb.

                “perfect of her kind,” and Hartley Coleridge remarked in 1832 that “Mrs. W seems
                remarkably flourishing, and does not grow older. Indeed, both she and her excellent

                with her parents at RM. In her twenties, Dora had had at least two serious suitors:
                her distant cousin Lt. Tom Robinson in 1825 (as chronicled in Notebook 1) and Rev.
                William Ayling, a visitor to Rydal who unexpectedly proposed in 1830 and was
                decisively rejected.

                        was Wordsworth’s daughter” (<hi rend="italic">LDW</hi>, 90).</note> 
                Between her chronic illnesses and an apparent eating disorder, Dora grew so feeble in the mid-1830s that
                her parents openly referred to her and DW as the twin “Invalids” of RM and WW
                privately worried that his daughter might need to be sent away, as “the state of
                [her] poor Aunt causes so much Distress to Dora that <hi rend="italic">she</hi>
                cannot I am sure recover, if she remains here.” “The most painful part,”
                he continued, “is the effect which her Aunt’s illness produces upon the Niece.
                The poor Aunt is 64 years of age, but Dora is young.”

                Having come to rely on her good health and her firmness in times of crisis, the family
                at RM was thunderstruck when, after seeming to have beaten the rheumatic fever, SH suddenly

                serve as Ebba’s godmother upon the child’s birth in 1820. Just how seriously DW took
                this charge is evident in a letter she sent Ebba in late 1834 expressing a fervent
                desire to see her “dear God-daughter before I quit this world” and imparting “a

                Dowlings’ school in Ambleside, and socializing with fellow teenagers from families

                of 1833, decided to build a vacation home of their own and took possession of Fox How
                in Loughrigg in 1834. Since 1827 Thomas Sr. had been headmaster at Rugby, the prestigious
                boarding school in Wiltshire. While devoutly Christian and deeply moralistic, he zealously
                campaigned for ecclesiastical and parliamentary reform, often leaving him at odds
                with High Church Tory acquaintances like the Wordsworths.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">In 1832, WW remarked to another progressive friend, Crabb Robinson, that

                In the early 1830s Mr. Carr scaled back his practice and the childless couple moved from Cumpstone
                Lodge in Ambleside to Hill Top, a home in Near Sawrey now associated with its later
                resident, Beatrix Potter. Despite the move, Mr. Carr remained highly assiduous
                toward the Wordsworths, making the 18-mile round-trip journey from Hill Top to RM
                several times in a week when Dora’s or DW’s condition required. While DW teased him
                about needing an “ear trumpet” to hear his patients, she paid heartfelt tribute to
                this “faithful Friend” in her 1835 poem “To Thomas Carr, My Medical Attendant”  <!--Include link here!!! BUt where is it? Can't find in Poems-->

                        for her newborn daughter, Dinah (or Diana, 1825–93). Betty and her stonemason husband, Edward
                        Dixon (1789–1830), lived on the edge of Grasmere in Easedale, and she may have known DW from
                        having once worked at RM. Parish and census records show Diana growing up to work as a housemaid in
                        Loughrigg before marrying Frank Garnett of Grasmere in 1852.</note>

                      41-page review of two new editions of WW’s poems that honored him for driving stodgy “poetic diction” out of fashion (319) and having 
                      conveyed “a deeper sense of the dignity of his calling” than any previous poet ([Taylor], <title level="a">Wordsworth’s 
                      <title level="m">Poetical Works</title>,</title> 319, 338). WW had already been informed of this review by its anonymous author, his friend and admirer Henry Taylor.</note>

                      Heath (see note for 6 October; for their earlier stays with the Hoares, see WLMS 1 / 9 / 3 and 1 / 11 / 7). The eldest son, John, had just returned
                      from a long trip in Florence, where he pursued his classical interests while trying to restore his fragile health. The middle son, Charles, had also
                      spent much of 1833–34 on the Continent, and, while touring the Louvre, he had fallen in “Love at First Sight” with Charlotte
                      Day, a clergyman’s daughter from Suffolk whom he would marry in December 1835 (Charles Wordsworth, <title level="m">Annals</title>, 158–60).</note>

                     after the family “banished” cats from RM, robins occasionally entered the home through open windows. One particular bird, he
                     recalled, “took up its abode” in DW’s sickroom near the end of 1834 “and at night used to perch upon a nail from
                     which a picture had hung” and “sing and fan her face with its wings in a manner that was very touching”

                            Hutchinson Jr. on 16 February, which relates how Tom’s sister Ebba recently attended “three Parties

                            DW’s wording seems to suggest that one of the revelers – perhaps Minto Farquhar or Captain Hamilton

                         behind, to petition for higher wages. When citing this entry in their biography of DW, Gittings and Manton seem to intentionally omit the phrase
                         “Kitchen disturbances – Wages &amp;c.” in order to misleadingly suggest that DW’s “uncharacteristic, almost childish”
                        distress emanated not from a sense of betrayal by their long-time domestics but from WW and MW’s perceived “desertion of herself and Dora”

                        since the early 1820s, became such an impediment that he was placed on indefinite leave and replaced by the young Irish curate
                        James Kingsley (1809–39). Three years on, Fleming was using his family’s influence to have himself reinstated and his popular 
                        replacement evicted from the rectory attached to the living. This struck many, including the Wordsworths, as an unusually egregious case of
                        church politics trumping the spiritual well-being of local parishioners (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 4:370, 5:648, 6:19, 6:60).</note>

                    condition had gradually improved, and DW had often struggled with acute physical pain and memory loss (<title level="m">Letters</title>,
                    6:78, 83, 89). In a 26 September letter to his and DW’s brother Christopher, WW reported that “Our dear Sister is in bodily

                    recovered.” More specifically, he noted that “her memory of passing events has greatly failed, and her judgements also in
                    all that respects her disease, though not at all in other things. Indeed I think upon points of morals, character, literature, etc.,
                    she expresses herself as well or better than ever she did” (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 6:96). Writing to Robert Southey two
                    days later, however, he was less upbeat, fearing that her faltering memory and “impaired judgement” were side-effects of “the

                        but this is confuted by the fact that his Dora was not born until late 1835 (or several months after Ebba’s dated transcription of this poem)

               <p>A lively friend of Dorothy who was a writer, a music teacher, an amateur painter, and a fell walker. Mary met Robert Southey
                 in Portugal in 1800 and became a close friend, eventually settling next door to his family in Keswick (1812–1817). Over time,
                 she became acquainted with the broader Southey-Coleridge-Wordsworth circle, close especially with Dorothy and Sara Hutchinson.
                 In 1816, she overextended herself financially to build a new home in Rosthwaite, Borrowdale, where she lived for just a short
                 time, despite her love for the landscape and having become an “active climber of the hills.” This house was the starting place
                 for the 1818 Scafell Pike. In the following year, Mary moved to Boulogne in order to retrench and never returned to England,
                 but the Wordsworths continued to correspond with her, and they visited her in France during their 1820 Continental Tour. In
                 1830, she married a younger man named Mr. Slade, concerning her friends at home. The most complete source on her life is David

                    friend and later biographer Robert Southey. According to Southey’s <title level="m">Life</title>, after Bell requested Dorothy’s
                    feedback on his Madras school book, she “spent much time and labour in remodeling the work for him, and, indeed, entirely rewrote
                    it, much to his apparent satisfaction at the time; subsequently, however, he threw this manuscript aside, and published it nearly
                    as he had originally composed it.” William Johnson, the addressee of Dorothy’s 1818 Scafell Pike letter, was the head of Bell’s
                    Central School in London. As a link between Dorothy, Johnson, and Lord Kenyon, Bell may have been involved in the production of the

                     Lakes in 1804, when Thomas returned to public life, their friendship with the Wordsworths endured and Caroline became one of Dorothy’s
                     most regular correspondents. In 1807, Thomas would help achieve the long-delayed passage of the Slave Trade Act.</p>

                    Hartley, often stayed with the Wordsworths on weekends. After working as a private tutor and studying at St. John’s College, Cambridge,
                    he became a distinguished scholar and educationist.</p>

                    with them between 1808 and 1815. After graduating from Merton College, Oxford, in 1818, Hartley began a feckless early adulthood
                    that included being dismissed from a fellowship at Oriel College on charges of “sottishness,” failing to launch a career as a
                    London magazine writer, returning to Ambleside to teach at his former school, and returning to periodical writing after the
                    school was shuttered. While he later enjoyed moderate success as an essayist and poet, he died a childless bachelor who, in
                    the eyes of many, had never fulfilled his early promise. </p>

               <p>Poet, critic, philosopher, walker, and beloved early friend of Dorothy and William Wordsworth. In 1800, Coleridge and his wife,
                    Sara, moved to Greta Hall in Keswick, 13 miles from Dove Cottage. In 1804, he left Keswick (and his troubled marriage) for Malta 
                    and Italy in hopes of recovering his physical and mental health. He returned little recovered in 1806 and almost immediately 
                    separated from his wife, leaving her and his daughter at Keswick with the Southeys but arranging for his boys to attend school 
                    in Ambleside. Between frequent stints as the Wordsworths’ houseguest, he spent much of 1807–1808 lecturing and writing in London 
                    and most of 1809 and early 1810 back in the Lakes launching his new journal,<title level="m">The Friend</title>. After he 
                    quarrelling with William in the spring of 1810, he again moved south, this time for good.</p>

               <p>Sara Hutchinson was the unmarried younger sister of Mary Wordsworth, a close friend of Dorothy’s, and for many years an integral
                    part of the Wordsworth household. Best known, perhaps, as “Asra,” the woman with whom S. T. Coleridge hopelessly fell in love 
                    in 1799 (distressing all families concerned), she was an eager mountaineer, a lively correspondent, and a keen mind. It was to 
                    her that Dorothy and Mary Barker wrote from the summit of Scafell Pike in 1818. Coleridge said of Sara, “If Sense, Sensibility, 
                    Sweetness of Temper, perfect Simplicity and an unpretending Nature, joined to shrewdness &amp; entertainingness, make a valuable 
                    Woman, Sarah H. is so.” Joanna was the youngest Hutchinson sister, also unmarried, and also a frequent visitor and companion to 
                    Dorothy. Together they traveled to Scotland in 1822 and the Isle of Man in 1828. Dorothy wrote “Lines addressed to Joanna H. from 
                    Gwerndovennant June 1826” to this valued sister-in-law. Sara and Joanna both kept house at times for their brother Thomas, who 
                    farmed in various locations, including Gallow Hill (Yorkshire), Park House (near Ullswater), and Hindwell (Mid Wales).</p>

               <p>William Johnson, former curate and schoolmaster in Grasmere (1811–1812), was the recipient of the October 1818 letter that contained
                    Dorothy’s account of ascending Scafell Pike. He was intimate with the Wordsworths, and Sara Hutchinson’s letters indicate that he was
                    thought a possible match for her sister Joanna. Johnson was born in Cumberland but ended up spending much of his career in London, 
                    having been hired by Dr. Andrew Bell to run a new model school established by the National Society for the Education of the Poor in
                    the Principles of the Established Church. His work in training students and fellow teachers was essential to the success of the

               <p>Historians remember Lord Kenyon primarily as an activist against Catholic emancipation, but he enters Dorothy Wordsworth’s orbit
                    as an associate of Dr. Andrew Bell and Rev. William Johnson. Kenyon, an important lawyer and landowner in North Wales, served 
                    with Bell and Johnson as one of the leaders of the National Society for the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the 
                    Established Church. The second surviving manuscript witness of Dorothy’s 1818 Scafell Pike ascent (a copy made by an unknown hand)
                    was sent to the Hutchinsons under his franking privilege. For this reason, we refer to it as the “Kenyon Transcript.”</p>

               <p>Charles Luff (from 1803, Captain Luff of the Patterdale Loyal Mountaineers) and his wife, Letitia, lived for some years in a cottage
                    at Side Farm near Goldrill Bridge in Patterdale, though they often took lodgings at Ambleside. The Wordsworths came to know them 
                    through the Clarksons soon after settling in Grasmere. In 1812, having suffered financial losses, the Luffs emigrated to Mauritius, 
                    where Charles died in 1815. Letitia returned to England, living at Dale Lodge in Grasmere before purchasing and renovating Fox Ghyll
                    near Ambleside in 1825. The Luffs hosted Dorothy and William Wordsworth during their 1805 Ullswater tour.</p>

                    of Ullswater. Notwithstanding political differences—John enthusiastically supported progressive causes and served as a Whig 
                    MP from 1826 to 1830—the Marshalls remained friends with the considerably more conservative Wordsworths until death. The

                    connections with the archbishop of Canterbury, he became a rector in Norfolk in 1804 and domestic chaplain to the archbishop a 
                    year later. In later years, he would hold a series of clerical and academic appointments, which provided a platform for his regular
                    defenses of conservative and High Church causes. His largest impact, however, came as an administrator at Trinity College, Cambridge,
                    during the 1820s and 1830s, where he oversaw a series of educational and clerical reforms. In 1804 he married Priscilla Lloyd, the

               <p>William and Mary Wordsworth’s oldest and only surviving daughter, who was particularly close to her father and protective of his literary
                    reputation. Her namesake, Dorothy, was something of a third parent to her, often serving as her main disciplinarian and nursing her through
                    chronic illnesses. After struggling in various educational establishments, Dora flourished when Ann Dowling took over the girls’ school 
                    in Ambleside in 1818. In adulthood, Dora gradually replaced Dorothy as William’s principal scribe and traveling companion, accompanying 
                    him and Coleridge on their summer 1828 tour of Northern Europe. In 1839, William rejected Edward Quillinan’s request for Dora’s hand, 
                    ostensibly because of this family friend’s Catholicism and troubled finances but also because of the poet’s deep dependence on his daughter.
                    Eventually, however, he relented and blessed the couple’s May 1841 union. After convalescing from a serious illness in Portugal in 1845 and
                    1846, Dora returned to Rydal Mount, dying there in July 1847.</p>

                    youth of about fifteen years of age. He is able to do any kind of work, but prefers sitting to standing, riding to walking, and
                    lying in bed to anything in the world.” Forbidden by his parents from joining the army in 1828, Willy remained largely aimless 
                    until his father made him his Sub-distributor of Stamps in 1831, which paved the way for him to replace William as Distributor 
                    in 1842. He married Fanny Eliza Graham in 1847, with whom he had four children.</p>
