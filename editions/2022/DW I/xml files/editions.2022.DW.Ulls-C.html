            <p>Having said so much of a point of view to which few are likely to ascend, I am induced
               to subjoin an account of a short excursion through more accessible parts of the country,
               made at a time when it is seldom seen but by the inhabitants. As the journal was written
               for one acquainted with the general features of the country, only those effects and
               appearances are dwelt upon, which are produced by the changeableness of the atmosphere,
               or belong to the season when the excursion was made. </p>
            <p>A.D. 1805.—On the 7th of November, on a damp and gloomy morning, we left Grasmere
               Vale, intending to pass a few days on the banks of Ulswater. A mild and dry autumn
               had been unusually favourable to the preservation and beauty of foliage; and, far
               advanced as the season was, the trees on the larger Island of Rydal-mere retained
               a splendour which did not need the heightening of sunshine. We noticed, as we passed,
               that the line of the grey rocky shore of that island, shaggy with variegated bushes
               and shrubs, and spotted and striped with purplish brown heath, indistinguishably blending
               with its image reflected in the still water, produced a curious resemblance, both
               in form and colour, to a richly-coated caterpillar, as it might appear through a magnifying
               glass of extraordinary power. The mists gathered as we went along: but, when we reached
               the top of Kirkstone, we were glad we had not been discouraged by the apprehension
               of bad weather. Though not able to see a hundred yards before us, we were more than
               contented. At such a time, and in such a place, every scattered stone the size of
               one’s head becomes a companion. Near the top of the pass is the remnant of an old
               wall, which (magnified, though obscured, by the vapour) might have been taken for
               a fragment of some monument of ancient grandeur,—yet that same pile of stones we had
               never before even observed. This situation, it must be allowed, is not favourable
               to gaiety; but a pleasing hurry of spirits accompanies the surprize occasioned by
               objects transformed, dilated, or distorted, as they are when seen through such a medium.
               Many of the fragments of rock on the top and slopes of Kirkstone, and of similar places
               are fantastic enough in themselves; but the full effect of such impressions can only
               be had in a state of weather when they are not likely to be <em>sought</em> for. It was not till we had descended considerably that the fields of Hartshope were
               seen, like a lake tinged by the reflection of sunny clouds: I mistook them for Brothers-water,
               but, soon after, we saw that Lake gleaming faintly with a steelly brightness,—then,
               as we continued to descend, appeared the brown oaks, and the birches of lively yellow—and
               the cottages—and the lowly Hall of Hartshope, with its long roof and ancient chimneys.
               During great part of our way to Patterdale, we had rain, or rather drizzling vapour;
               for there was never a drop upon our hair or clothes larger than the smallest pearls
               upon a lady’s ring.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The following morning, incessant rain till 11 o’clock, when the sky began to clear,
                  and we walked along the eastern shore of Ulswater towards the farm of Blowick. The
                  wind blew strong, and drove the clouds forward, on the side of the mountain above
                  our heads;—two storm-stiffened black yew-trees fixed our notice, seen through, or
                  under the edge of, the flying mists,—four or five goats were bounding among the rocks;—the
                  sheep moved about more quietly, or cowered beneath their sheltering places. This is
                  the only part of the country where goats are now found

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>WW’s note: “A. D. 1805. These also have disappeared.” </span></div>
                  </div> ; but this morning, before we had seen these, I was reminded of that picturesque animal
                  by two rams of mountain breed, both with Ammonian horns, and with beards majestic
                  as that which Michael Angelo has given to his statue of Moses.——But to return; when
                  our path had brought us to that part of the naked common which overlooks the woods
                  and bush-besprinkled fields of Blowick, the lake, clouds, and mists were all in motion
                  to the sound of sweeping winds; —the church and cottages of Patterdale scarcely visible,
                  or seen only by fits between the shifting vapours. To the northward the scene was
                  less visionary;—Place Fell steady and bold;—the whole lake driving onward like a great
                  river—waves dancing round the small islands. The house at Blowick was the boundary
                  of our walk; and we returned, lamenting to see a decaying and uncomfortable dwelling
                  in a place where sublimity and beauty seemed to contend with each other. But these
                  regrets were dispelled by a glance on the woods that clothe the opposite steeps of
                  the lake. How exquisite was the mixture of sober and splendid hues! The general colouring
                  of the trees was brown—rather that of ripe hazel nuts: but towards the water, there
                  were yet beds of green, and in the highest parts of the wood, was abundance of yellow
                  foliage, which, gleaming through a vapoury lustre, reminded us of masses of clouds,
                  as you see them gathered together in the west, and touched with the golden light of
                  the setting sun.</p>
            </div>
            <p>After dinner we walked up the Vale: I had never had an idea of its extent and width
               in passing along the public road on the other side. We followed the path that leads
               from house to house; two or three times it took us through some of those copses or
               groves that cover the little hillocks in the middle of the vale, making an intricate
               and pleasing intermixture of lawn and wood. Our fancies could not resist the temptation;
               and we fixed upon a spot for a cottage, which we began to build: and finished as easily
               as castles are raised in the air.—Visited the same spot in the evening. I shall say
               nothing of the moonlight aspect of the situation which had charmed us so much in the
               afternoon; but I wish you had been with us when, in returning to our friend’s house,
               we espied his lady’s large white dog, lying in the moonshine upon the round knoll
               under the old yew-tree in the garden, a romantic image—the dark tree and its dark
               shadow—and the elegant creature, as fair as a spirit! The torrents murmured softly:
               the mountains down which they were falling did not, to my sight furnish a back-ground
               for this Ossianic picture; but I had a consciousness of the depth of the seclusion,
               and that mountains were embracing us on all sides; “I saw not, but I <em>felt</em> that they were there.”</p>
            <p>Friday, November 9th.—Rain, as yesterday, till 10 o’clock , when we took a boat to
               row down the lake. The day improved,—clouds and sunny gleams on the mountains. In
               the large bay under Place Fell, three fishermen were dragging a net, a picturesque
               group beneath the high and bare crags! A raven was seen aloft; not hovering like the
               kite, for that is not the habit of the bird; but passing on with a straight-forward
               perseverance, and timing the motion of its wings to its own croaking. The waters were
               agitated; and the iron tone of the raven’s voice, which strikes upon the ear at all
               times as the more dolorous from its regularity, was in fine keeping with the wild
               scene before our eyes. This carnivorous fowl is a great enemy to the lambs of these
               solitudes; I recollect frequently seeing, when a boy, bunches of unfledged ravens
               suspended from the churchyard gates of H————— for which a reward of <em>so</em> much a head was given to the adventurous destroyer.—The fishermen drew their net
               ashore, and hundreds of fish were leaping in their prison. They were all of the kind
               called skellies, a sort of fresh-water herring, shoals of which may sometimes be seen
               dimpling or rippling the surface of the lake in calm weather. This species is not
               found, I believe, in any other of these lakes; nor, as far as I know, is the chevin,
               that <em>spiritless</em> fish, (though I am loth to call it so, for it was a prime favourite with Isaac Walton,)
               which must frequent Ulswater, as I have seen a large shoal passing into the lake from
               the river Emont. <em>Here</em> are no pike, and the char are smaller than those of the other lakes, and of inferior
               quality; but the grey trout attains a very large size, sometimes weighing above twenty
               pounds. This lordly creature seems to know that “retiredness is a piece of majesty”;
               for it is scarcely ever caught, or even seen, except when it quits the depths of the
               lake in the spawning season, and runs up into the streams, where it is too often destroyed
               in disregard of the law of the land and of nature.</p>
            <p>Quitted the boat in the bay of Sandwyke, and pursued our way towards Martindale along
               a pleasant path—at first through a coppice, bordering the lake, then through green
               fields—and came to the village, (if village it may be called, for the houses are few,
               and separated from each other,) a sequestered spot, shut out from the view of the
               lake. Crossed the one-arched bridge, below the chapel, with its “bare ring of mossy
               wall,” and single yew-tree. At the last house in the dale we were greeted by the master,
               who was sitting at his door, with a flock of sheep collected round him, for the purpose
               of smearing them with tar (according to the custom of the season) for protection against
               the winter’s cold. He invited us to enter, and view a room built by Mr. Hasell for
               the accommodation of his friends at the annual chase of red deer in his forests at
               the head of these dales. The room is fitted up in the sportsman’s style, with a cupboard
               for bottles and glasses, with strong chairs, and a dining-table; and ornamented with
               the horns of the stags caught at these hunts for a succession of years—the length
               of the last race each had run being recorded under his spreading antlers. The good
               woman treated us with oaten cake, new and crisp; and after this welcome refreshment
               and rest, we proceeded on our return to Patterdale by a short cut over the mountains.
               On leaving the fields of Sandwyke, while ascending by a gentle slope along the valley
               of Martindale, we had occasion to observe that in thinly-peopled glens of this character
               the general want of wood gives a peculiar interest to the scattered cottages embowered
               in sycamore. Towards its head, this valley splits into two parts; and in one of these
               (that to the left) there is no house, nor any building to be seen but a cattle-shed
               on the side of a hill, which is sprinkled over with trees, evidently the remains of
               an extensive forest. Near the entrance of the other division stands the house where
               we were entertained, and beyond the enclosures of that farm there are no other. A
               few old trees remain, relics of the forest, a little stream hastens, though with serpentine
               windings, through the uncultivated hollow, where many cattle were pasturing. The cattle
               of this country are generally white, or light-coloured; but these were dark brown,
               or black, which heightened the resemblance this scene bears to many parts of the Highlands
               of Scotland.—While we paused to rest upon the hill-side, though well contented with
               the quiet every-day sounds—the lowing of cattle, bleating of sheep, and the very gentle
               murmuring of the valley stream, we could not but think what a grand effect the music
               of the bugle-horn would have among these mountains. It is still heard once every year,
               at the chase I have spoken of; a day of festivity for the inhabitants of this district
               except the poor deer, the most ancient of them all. Our ascent even to the top was
               very easy; when it was accomplished we had exceedingly fine views, some of the lofty
               Fells being resplendent with sunshine, and others partly shrouded by clouds. Ulswater,
               bordered by black steeps, was of dazzling brightness: the plain beyond Penrith smooth
               and bright, or rather gleamy, as the sea or sea sands. Looked down into Boardale,
               which, like Stybarrow, has been named from the wild swine that formerly abounded here;
               but it has now no sylvan covert, being smooth and bare, a long, narrow, deep, cradle-shaped
               glen, lying so sheltered that one would be pleased to see it planted by human hands,
               there being a sufficiency of soil; and the trees would be sheltered almost like shrubs
               in a green-house.—After having walked some way along the top of the hill, came in
               view of Glenriddin and the mountains at the head of Grisdale.—Before we began to descend,
               turned aside to a small ruin, called at this day the chapel, where it is said the
               inhabitants of Martindale and Patterdale were accustomed to assemble for worship.
               There are now no traces from which you could infer for what use the building had been
               erected; the loose stones and the few which yet continue piled up resemble those which
               lie elsewhere on the mountain; but the shape of the building having been oblong, its
               remains differ from those of a common sheep-fold; and it has stood east and west.
               Scarcely did the Druids, when they fled to these fastnesses, perform their rites in
               any situation more exposed to disturbance from the elements. One cannot pass by without
               being reminded that the rustic psalmody must have had the accompaniment of many a
               wildly-whistling blast; and what dismal storms must have often drowned the voice of
               the preacher! As we descend Patterdale opens upon the eye in grand simplicity, skreened
               by mountains, and proceeding from two heads, Deepdale and Hartshope, where lies the
               little lake of Brotherswater, named in old maps Broaderwater, and probably rightly
               so; for Bassenthwaite Mere at this day, is familiarly called Broadwater; but the change
               in the appellation of this small lake or pool (if it be a corruption) may have been
               assisted by some melancholy accident similar to what happened about twenty years ago,
               when two brothers were drowned there, having gone out to take their holiday pleasure
               upon the ice on a new-year’s day. </p>
            <p>A rough and precipitous peat track brought us down to our friend’s house.—Another
               fine moonlight night; but a thick fog rising from the neighbouring river, enveloped
               the rocky and wood-crested knoll on which our fancy-cottage had been erected; and,
               under the damp cast upon my feelings, I consoled myself with moralising on the folly
               of hasty decisions in matters of importance, and the necessity of having at least
               one year’s knowledge of a place before you realise airy suggestions in solid stone.
               </p>
            <p>Saturday, November 10th. At the breakfast-table tidings reached us of the death of
               Lord Nelson, and of the victory at Trafalgar. Sequestered as we were from the sympathy
               of a crowd, we were shocked to hear that the bells had been ringing joyously at Penrith
               to celebrate the triumph. In the rebellion of the year 1745, people fled with their
               valuables from the open country to Patterdale, as a place of refuge secure from the
               incursions of strangers. At that time, news such as we had heard might have been long
               in penetrating so far into the recesses of the mountains; but now, as you know, the
               approach is easy, and the communication, in summer time, almost hourly: nor is this
               strange, for travellers after pleasure are become not less active, and more numerous
               than those who formerly left their homes for purposes of gain. The priest on the banks
               of the remotest stream of Lapland will talk familiarly of Buonaparte’s last conquests,
               and discuss the progress of the French revolution, having acquired much of his information
               from adventurers impelled by curiosity alone. </p>
            <p>The morning was clear and cheerful after a night of sharp frost. At 10 o’clock we
               took our way on foot towards Pooley Bridge, on the same side of the lake we had coasted
               in a boat the day before.—Looked backwards to the south from our favourite station
               above Blowick. The dazzling sunbeams striking upon the church and village, while the
               earth was steaming with exhalations not traceable in other quarters, rendered their
               forms even more indistinct than the partial and flitting veil of unillumined vapour
               had done two days before. The grass on which we trod, and the trees in every thicket
               were dripping with melted hoar-frost. We observed the lemon-coloured leaves of the
               birches, as the breeze turned them to the sun, sparkle, or rather <em>flash</em>, like diamonds, and the leafless purple twigs were tipped with globes of shining
               crystal.</p>
            <p>The day continued delightful, and unclouded to the end. I will not describe the country
               which we slowly travelled through, nor relate our adventures; and will only add, that
               on the afternoon of the 13th we returned along the banks of Ulswater by the usual
               road. The lake was in deep repose after the agitations of a wet and stormy morning.
               The trees in Gowbarrow park were in that state when what is gained by the disclosure
               of their bark and branches compensates, almost, for the loss of foliage, exhibiting
               the variety which characterises the point of time between autumn and winter. The hawthorns
               were leafless; their round heads covered with rich red berries, and adorned with arches
               of green brambles, and eglantines hung with glossy hips; and the grey trunks of some
               of the ancient oaks, which in the summer season might have been regarded only for
               their venerable majesty, now attracted notice by a pretty embellishment of green mosses
               and fern intermixed with russet leaves retained by those slender outstarting twigs
               which the veteran tree would not have tolerated in his strength. The smooth silver
               branches of the ashes were bare; most of the alders as green as the Devonshire cottage-myrtle
               that weathers the snows of Christmas.—Will you accept it as some apology for my having
               dwelt so long on the woodland ornaments of these scenes—that artists speak of the
               trees on the banks of Ulswater, and especially along the bays of Stybarrow crags,
               as having a peculiar character of picturesque intricacy in their stems and branches,
               which their rocky stations and the mountain winds have combined to give them? </p>
            <p>At the end of Gowbarrow park a large herd of deer were either moving slowly or standing
               still among the fern. I was sorry when a chance companion, who had joined us by the
               way, startled them with a whistle, disturbing an image of grave simplicity and thoughtful
               enjoyment; for I could have fancied that those natives of this wild and beautiful
               region were partaking with us a sensation of the solemnity of the closing day. The
               sun had been set some time; and we could perceive that the light was fading away from
               the coves of Helvellyn, but the lake under a luminous sky, was more brilliant than
               before. </p>
            <p>After tea at Patterdale, set out again:— a fine evening; the seven stars close to
               the mountain-top; all the stars seemed brighter than usual. The steeps were reflected
               in Brotherswater, and, above the lake, appeared like enormous black perpendicular
               walls. The Kirkstone torrents had been swoln by the rains, and now filled the mountain
               pass with their roaring, which added greatly to the solemnity of our walk. Behind
               us, when we had climbed to a great height, we saw one light, very distinct, in the
               vale, like a large red star—a solitary one in the gloomy region. The cheerfulness
               of the scene was in the sky above us. </p>
            <p>Reached home a little before midnight.</p>
