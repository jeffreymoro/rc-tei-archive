                  her most sustained effort in the genre, the fifteen compact notebooks from 1824–35
                  generally identified as the <em>Rydal Journals</em> (<em>RJ</em>), remains largely unpublished and virtually unknown outside specialized academic
                  circles. While several of the more striking passages from these journals have been
                  referenced in the occasional biography or scholarly article, only one short segment—a
                  three-week stretch chronicling her 1828 trip to the Isle of Man—has appeared in its
                  entirety.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>William Knight published the first two weeks of DW’s Isle of Man tour in his 1889
                           Life of William Wordsworth and later reprinted these excerpts in his 1897 edition
                           of DW’s journals (Knight, Life, 3:140–49; KJ, 2:277–82). Two generations later, Ernest
                           De Sélincourt included the entire tour in vol. 2 of DWJ.</span></div>
                  </div> Accordingly, this concluding section of <em>Dorothy Wordsworth’s Lake District</em> marks an important first step toward rectifying this problem, as it features complete
                  transcriptions of the first and last volumes (Notebooks 1 and 15) of what proved to
                  be the last great endeavor of Dorothy’s writing career.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Paradoxically, one of Dorothy’s foremost champions, the early twentieth-century Oxford
                  don Ernest De Sélincourt, is perhaps most culpable for consigning the <em>RJ</em> to obscurity. For in both his landmark study of her life (1933) and his two-volume
                  edition of her journals (1941), De Sélincourt categorically dismissed the <em>RJ</em> as “eleven shabby little notebooks,” calling them “wholly capricious” in design and
                  displaying “little of the character of the Alfoxden or Grasmere Journals.” 
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Eight years after disparaging the RJ in his 1933 biography, De Sélincourt recycled
                           many of his remarks verbatim in the introduction to DWJ (DWB, 368; DWJ, 1: xviii–xix).
                           A half-century later, his erroneous description of the RJ notebooks—which are, in
                           fact, fifteen in number and remarkably well preserved—received new life when, without
                           citing their obvious source, Gittings and Manton described DW’s later diaries as “eleven
                           worn and shabby notebooks” (242).</span></div>
                  </div> To justify how, in a collection putatively featuring all of Dorothy’s journals, he
                  included just a tiny fraction of the <em>RJ</em>, he somewhat feebly asserted that the Isle of Man tour is “the only portion written
                  in consecutive style, as a journal rather than a mere diary.”
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>While assertions like these have undoubtedly suppressed interest in the <em>RJ</em>, numerous researchers and enthusiasts have nonetheless made pilgrimages to Grasmere
                  to study the original notebooks at the Wordsworth Trust. In the 1970s Carl Ketcham
                  transcribed roughly 20% of the <em>RJ</em> and then summarized his findings in a lengthy article published in <em>The Wordsworth Circle</em> in 1978.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

                           “Dorothy Wordsworth’s Journals.”
                           Ketcham’s partial transcription, which his family donated to the Wordsworth Trust
                           upon his passing in 1991, proved immensely helpful during the early stages of this
                           project, when we were still learning to decipher DW’s handwriting.</span></div>
                  </div> Where he, like many Wordsworthians of his generation, turned to Dorothy’s journals
                  primarily for insights into the life and works of her famous brother, subsequent scholars
                  have firmly reinstalled Dorothy at the center of the <em>RJ</em> narrative. In an important 2015 article on 
                  “Dorothy Wordsworth and Old Age,”
                   for instance, Pamela Woof offered what was at the time the most thorough engagement
                  with these later notebooks since Ketcham’s essay. And, in 2021, a pair of writers
                  based three radically different books on the <em>RJ</em>: a historical novel on Dorothy’s final years (Kathleen Winter’s <em>Undersong</em>), a poetry collection on themes of ageing and illness (Polly Atkin’s <em>Much with Body</em>), and an alternative biography incorporating perspectives from disability studies
                  (Atkin’s <em>Recovering Dorothy</em>).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>That, in order to write about the journals, each of these researchers had to independently
                  copy out those portions that pertained to their interests underscores the need for
                  a reliable and readily accessible transcription of all fifteen volumes of the <em>RJ</em>. While such an undertaking is beyond the scope of this edition, we are excited to
                  make available for the first time fully annotated and contextualized transcriptions
                  of Notebooks 1 and 15. These bookend volumes of the <em>RJ</em> cover dramatically different life stages, the one a period of robust health and the
                  other of increasing infirmity. Yet they share both a setting (Rydal Mount and its
                  environs) and an abiding emphasis on Dorothy’s love for the people and landscapes
                  of her native region. 
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>While, as the name implies, nine volumes of the RJ (Notebooks 1, 5–7, and 11–15) are
                           set in and around Rydal, the remaining six chronicle extended trips DW made in the
                           late 1820s to the Midlands (Notebooks 2–4), Halifax (parts of Notebooks 6 and 10),
                           the Isle of Man (Notebook 8 and part of Notebook 9), and Leicestershire (much of Notebook
                           10).</span></div>
                  </div> Notebook 1 spans December 1824 through December 1825, capturing the daily routines
                  of an unusually vibrant 53-year-old who clearly relished a new phase with fewer domestic
                  responsibilities, relative financial security, and a large circle of friends within
                  walking distance of home. Notebook 15, by contrast, chronicles a comparatively dispiriting
                  six-month period of late 1834 and early 1835, when, having survived several recent
                  brushes with death, Dorothy found her experience narrowed to her memories and what
                  she could see or hear from her upstairs bedroom at Rydal Mount.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Text of the <em>Rydal Journals</em></span><br/> The typical <em>RJ </em>entry consists of three or four succinct, allusive, and fragmentary descriptions written
                  in the slapdash hand that Dorothy often called “my scrawl.” While full of compelling
                  observations and vibrant descriptions, the <em>RJ</em> are considerably more prone than the <em>GJ</em> to lapsing into bare-bones accounts of the weather, the day’s events, and the health
                  of Dorothy’s housemates. This “sparser” style of the later journals has prompted Lucy
                  Newlyn to conjecture that their “main purpose was to serve as a rudimentary mnemonic
                  device” or perhaps as a “mood-diary.”

                  </div> For his part, Ketcham discerns a subtle artistry in Dorothy’s “customary brevity,”
                  remarking that the finest entries in the <em>RJ</em> combine “a vivid, staccato impressionism with the awareness of underlying unity.“

                           “staccato” style of DW’s entries (GJ, ix; 
                           “Dorothy Wordsworth and Old Age,”

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In keeping with her former practice, Dorothy typically composed several entries in
                  one sitting rather than writing in her journal every night, and she continued to have
                  no compunctions about using the same notebook as a journal, commonplace book, and
                  expense ledger.

                           see Bellanca, Daybooks of Discovery, 11–14.</span></div>
                  </div> Yet, whereas the <em>GJ</em> was explicitly written for her brother William and a few close friends and relations,
                  the <em>RJ</em> seem to have been intended solely for Dorothy’s own benefit. Alternations and emendations
                  in these journals consistently appear in the same shade of ink and quality of pen
                  as the original entry, suggesting that Dorothy almost invariably corrected her prose
                  as she wrote rather than in some later round of dedicated revision. In consequence,
                  this section varies from other parts of this edition in only noting those textual
                  variants or irregularities that might offer fresh perspectives into Dorothy’s writing
                  process. Above all, our priority has been to provide clean and accurate transcriptions
                  that faithfully preserve Dorothy’s final wording, spelling, and punctuation.</p>
            </div>
            <figure class="figure"><img src="sites/default/files/imported/editions/DW/images/7A4.jpeg" alt="Figure 1: Page from Notebook 15 (covering 8–12 November 1834) showing the quality of handwriting and types of revisions typically found in the RJ." class="inline" style=" width:400px;"/></figure>
            <p>After countless passes through the original manuscripts, we have become sufficiently
               familiar with Dorothy’s handwriting, diction, and orthography to now be able to offer
               confident transcriptions of over 95% of the text. Where our transcription remains
               tentative, we enclose the elusive word or phrase in editorial brackets and add a question
               mark (e.g., [night?]). If unable or unwilling to hazard a tentative transcription,
               we use an empty set of editorial brackets ([ ]) to mark each illegible word. Dorothy’s
               idiosyncratic punctuation poses a different set of challenges, as she routinely omits
               apostrophes in possessives (e.g., “Marys book”), treats line breaks as a substitute
               for end punctuation, and does little to distinguish her short dashes from her commas
               and periods. While careful to retain her punctuation, we have provided clarifying
               punctuation marks, always placing them inside editorial brackets (e.g., Mary[’]s book),
               as needed. </p>
            <p>Since even a clean transcription of the <em>RJ</em> can be opaque without some knowledge of the people, places, and events being described,
               we preface both notebooks with a brief introduction and an extensive biographical
               index covering individuals who appear most frequently therein. And within the text
               of the journals, we supply scores of hypertext annotations in hopes of helping readers
               have an even more engaging experience with Dorothy’s remarkable accounts of life in
               Rydal in the 1820s and 1830s.</p>
