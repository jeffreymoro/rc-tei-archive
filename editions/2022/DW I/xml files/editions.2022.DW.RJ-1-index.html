                  focusing especially on their relationship with Dorothy Wordsworth in 1824–1825. Each

                  years, age he or she turned in 1825, and, when applicable, a link to the entry for
                  said person in the online <em>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</em>. General bios for many of these can be found in this edition’s <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.RJ-15-index.html">Biographical Index</a>.</p>

                     WW’s literary reputation and audience were still steadily expanding, and he continued
                     to write new poems and rework old ones, including the revisions to <em>The Excursion</em> chronicled in Notebook 1.

                     </div> Although chronic eye pain often made it difficult for him to read and DW remarked
                     in 1825 that he was “much thinner than he used to be, and this makes him look old,”
                     the poet generally remained as hale and hearty as his sister.

                     </div> Beyond his literary commitments, WW devoted considerable energy during this period
                     to his duties as Distributor of Stamps for Westmorland and his extensive engagement
                     with local and national politics.</p>

               <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Wordsworth, Mary (née Hutchinson, 1770–1859, age 55):</span> WW’s wife, who before meeting her husband had been DW’s friend when they were teenagers
                  in Penrith. Like the other adults in her household, MW was increasingly prone to wanderlust
                  as her children came of age, and for much of the 1820s she, DW, and SH essentially
                  alternated being on duty at RM while the others traveled. With it being DW’s turn
                  to stay at home in 1825, MW spent most of that summer and fall with friends and family
                  at Kents Bank on the Cartmel Peninsula, Harrogate spa in Yorkshire, and Coleorton
                  Hall in Leicestershire. Accordingly, she appears less frequently in Notebook 1 than
                  in many subsequent sections of the <em>RJ</em>.</p>

                     son and kindhearted brother and nephew. Any expectations that he would follow his
                     father’s and uncle Christopher’s path to Cambridge were foiled by John’s struggles
                     with mathematics, a subject emphasized more heavily there than at other universities.
                     Accordingly, in 1823, WW used family connections to secure his son’s admission to
                     New College, Oxford.

                     to a reported typhus outbreak at Oxford. This left him largely carefree, and DW’s
                     journal suggests he spent much of his time both with old friends and with Fanny Barlow,
                     a pretty young heiress who arrived in the area in early 1825.</p>

                     in 1824 as “a very pleasing girl—simple and affectionate; uniting her Aunt Sarah’s
                     shrewdness to her mother’s gentleness.”

                     </div> After spending part of 1823–24 working in Ambleside as a teacher at the Dowlings’
                     school, Dora moved back to RM, where, when healthy, she helped her mother and aunts
                     with household chores and her father compose letters and copy poems. For much of the
                     decade covered by the <em>RJ</em>, her chronic illnesses dominated the family’s domestic routines and travel schedules.
                     In the summer of 1825, for instance, the Wordsworths spent two months at a rental
                     home at Kents Bank on Morecambe Bay largely for her health. In the short term, the
                     rest and sea air appear to have helped, as during this vacation a revitalized Dora
                     formed the most intense attachment of her young life with the family’s new friend
                     Jane Jewsbury.

                              / 52) and in their frank, exuberant, and ardent correspondence in the months that
                              followed. </span></div>
                     </div> And, still rejuvenated after returning to RM, she caught the eye of Lt. Tom Robinson,
                     a distant cousin spending his shore leave at his brother’s home in Ambleside. In general,
                     DW remained characteristically discrete about this budding relationship, but, if there
                     is any prevailing theme to the final segment of Notebook 1, it is how inseparable
                     Dora and Tom became throughout the fall of 1825.</p>

                     an avid sportsman and a jovial companion. Still haunted by the 1812 deaths of their
                     third and fourth children, his parents tended to be overprotective with Willy, which
                     resulted in his being largely educated at home rather than exposed to contagion at
                     a boarding school. In late 1823 DW reported that her then-13-year-old nephew “continues
                     stout and well, and improves as much in scholarship as can be expected . . . of one
                     so lively and volatile as he is.”

                     (February 1823–August 1825) away from home. At the outset of Notebook 1, she was in

                     1825, she spent the next six months in the Midlands comforting the deceased’s siblings,
                     John Monkhouse and Mary Hutchinson, and helping her brother Tom’s young family move

                     into an intimate friendship with the entire family at RM. Miss Jewsbury, or Jane to
                     her close friends, spent most of her most of her adolescence in Leicestershire, where
                     her father, Thomas (1767–1840), ran a series of only moderately successful textile
                     mills. Seeking a fresh start, he moved his family to Manchester in 1818 and found
                     work selling cotton goods and fire insurance. A year later, however, tragedy struck,
                     when his wife, Maria (née Smith, 1778–1819), died shortly after delivering their seventh
                     child, leaving the then-19-year-old Jane responsible for raising her younger siblings.
                     Despite these heavy domestic obligations and her often debilitating chronic sicknesses,
                     Jewsbury began regularly contributing to the <em>Manchester Gazette </em>in 1821, and by the mid-1820s she seemed poised to join the likes of Letitia Landon,
                     Caroline Bowles, and Felicia Hemans in the vanguard of English “poetesses.” Upon first
                     meeting this vivacious young writer in the spring of 1825, DW called her “a young

                     of a Bristol milliner he had married in 1795, shortly after his fellow “pantisocrat”
                     Samuel Taylor Coleridge had married Edith’s older sister Sarah. Since 1803 the Southeys
                     and Coleridges had lived together at Greta Hall in Keswick, with the former helping
                     to compensate for the financial and emotional support that was increasingly unforthcoming
                     from Mrs. Coleridge’s husband. Despite being routinely linked together in the public
                     mind, Southey and WW were more rivals than friends for the first decade of their acquaintance,
                     especially after Southey published a withering review of <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> in 1798. DW initially shared her brother’s disdain, believing Southey showed “nothing
                     of the dignity or enthusiasm of the Poet’s Character”; but her opinion was irrevocably
                     changed in 1805 by his compassionate response to her brother John’s tragic death,
                     as he “was so tender and kind that I loved him all at once – he wept with us in our
                     sorrow, and for that cause I think I must always love him.”

                     a few hours and several weeks. Five of the Southeys’ eight children survived through

               as in 1812 the eldest, Dorothy, provided fodder for local gossips by carrying on a
               romantic intrigue with John Christian Curwen, a Windermere grandee who, besides being
               married and twenty years her senior, was one of her father’s closest friends. Gleefully
               reporting this “scandalam magnatum” to a friend, Southey noted that Curwen “confesses
               to impudence but vows &amp; protests innocence as to any thing farther.” To this, Southey
               spitefully added that Miss Watson’s “beauty affords about as much excuse as his youth
               &amp; inexperience” (<a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/editions/southey_letters/Part_Four/HTML/letterEEd.26.2169.html"><em>Collected Letters</em>, Letter 2169</a> [2 November 1812]).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note94_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
