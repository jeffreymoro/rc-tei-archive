                Storm – wind rain flood – Chapel opened – Water falls
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">The Christmas Day opening of the
                            new chapel Lady Ann le Fleming had erected in Rydal was spoiled by
                            torrential rain. Dora wrote, “I never was out in such a storm, nor does
                            my Father ever remember experiencing so violent a one” 
                            (<ref target="https://tinyurl.com/mr356d7e">WLL / Wordsworth, Dora / 1 / 6</ref>). WW groused of the new chapel
                            that “the cost . . . much exceeded what was needful” but conceded that
                            “when time has softened down the exterior a little it will prove a great
                            ornament to the Village” (<title level="m">Letters</title>, 4:301). MW
                            considered it “a great monument to the Village,” despite “all the
                            blunders that have been made by the ignorance of the Builders” 
                            (<title level="m">LMW</title>, 120). Less equivocally, DW rejoiced that
                            Rydal was “beautified by our new Chapel which is a great comfort to us”
                            <title level="m">Letters</title>, 4:396).

                            woman of. . . . As to Aggy’s self she has I find little feeling about

                            (1764–1828) held a multi-day sale of furnishings from the house. Decades
                            later, Thomas De Quincey would characterize such sales as highlights of
                            the Westmorland social calendar for rich and poor alike. Besides
                            offering free liquor (customarily at the seller’s expense) and
                            occasional bargains, these events facilitated reunions between old

                            twenties largely for its proximity to his literary icon. For a decade
                            thereafter the Wilsons and Wordsworths enjoyed a close bond, but it was
                            severely strained after Wilson began publishing alternately admiring and

                            Poets” in 1817. Wilson’s inclusion in this outing therefore marked a

                            flowers from the hills, march in procession to the parish church, and
                            strew them about the altar, pews, and floor (which, at least in
                            Grasmere, was not paved until 1840) (Armitt, <title level="m">The

                            <title level="m">Every-day Book</title> of the 1820s, a traveler who witnessed this
                            rite in Grasmere reported, “In the procession I observed the ‘Opium

                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">As described
                            by Thomas West, Backbarrow is the site where the River Leven “falls with
                            great rapidity for the space of two miles, dashing its waters against
                            the rugged rocks, . . . forming several cascades” 
                            (<title level="m">Antiquities of Furness</title>, 36). The awe-inspiring or, in DW’s
                            words, “awful” effect of the crashing river had long made it a popular
                            destination for devotees of the natural sublime.
