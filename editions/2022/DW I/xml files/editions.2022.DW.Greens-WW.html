               <p>George Green and Sarah his Wife, Inhabitants of the Vale of Grasmere, having gone
                  to Langdale on the morning of Saturday the 19th of March last, set off to return to
                  their own house a lonely Dwelling on the same eve[n]ing, intending to cross over the
                  mountain. They had left a Daughter at home, eleven years of age, with the care of
                  five other children younger than herself, the youngest an infant at the breast. On
                  Monday afternoon, one of the Boys went to the nearest house to borrow a Cloak for
                  his Sister, who (he said) was going to Langdale to seek their Father and Mother, who
                  had not returned as they had expected, on Saturday. Immediately the alarm was spread,
                  and continual search was made, as long as daylight lasted, on that day, and the day
                  following, and till Wednesday afternoon, when the Bodies of the unfortunate Persons
                  were found. It is supposed they had been bewildered by the snow and mist; and they
                  perished by falling over the rocks, they were buried in one Grave on the Friday afternoon.</p>
               <p>The unhappy Fate of this Pair, and the forlorn condition in which the children are
                  left, have excited much compassion; which has been more deeply felt in their own neighbourhood
                  because the Deceased were much respected for their good morals and decent manners,
                  for their frugality and industry, and for the constant cheerfulness and independence
                  of mind, with which, without any assistance from the parish, they supported their
                  Family under the burthen of extreme poverty. This compassion has naturally been accompanied
                  with a general desire that more than ordinary exertions should be made to befriend
                  and protect the orphan children. It is therefore thought proper to draw up a brief
                  statement of the condition of the Family, for the information of such persons as may
                  be disposed to promote this benevolent design. </p>
               <div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e205">[Page]</div>
               <p>George Green had been twice married, and has left one Son and three Daughters by his
                  first wife who do not stand in need of assistance. By her who died with him, he has
                  left four Sons and four Daughters: the eldest of these, a Girl fifteen years of age,
                  is at present in Service; the second, a girl likewise, is with a Family who will take
                  care of her and fit her out, when she also is fit, for Service. One of the Boys will
                  be maintained by his Father’s eldest Son, who will breed him up to his own business;
                  so that there remain five children to be provided for.</p>
               <p>The Father has left a small Estate which is deeply mortgaged, and it is probable that
                  <span style="font-style:italic">after it is sold,</span> little or nothing will remain for his children. The Parish have therefore agreed
                  to allow, to each of these five children, two shillings per week till they are fit
                  to go to Service or to be apprenticed. The object then of those Persons who interest
                  themselves on this occasion, is to raise a Sum to make an addition to the weekly allowance
                  of the Parish, by means of which the children may be placed in a respectable Family
                  or Families: it is also intended to send them to School, and what money remains to
                  be employed in setting them forward as Servants or Apprentices.</p>
               <p>It is conceived that it will be grateful to benevolent Persons to promote a subscription
                  for the above purpose: first, as a natural tribute of human Sympathy upon so melancholy
                  an occasion; secondly, as a testimony of respect for the honesty, industry, patient
                  and even cheerful endurance of extreme poverty by which the Deceased were distinguished:
                  and lastly, and above all, that there may be a better hope that the children may go
                  forward in that course of innocence and virtue in which their Parents have thus far
                  conducted them.</p>

               day or two after my return home, when my mind was easier than it has been since, in
               passing through the churchyard I stopped at the grave of the poor Sufferers and immediately
               afterwards composed the following stanzas; <span style="font-style:italic">composed</span> I have said, I ought rather to have said effused, for it is the mere pouring out
               of my own feeling; but if you can turn these verses to any profit for the poor Orphans
               in any way, either by reciting, circulating in manuscript, or publishing them, either
               with or without the name of the Author, pray do so” (2:219–220). DW copied this poem
               into WW’s 19 April 1808 letter to STC (see n1). It remained unpublished until 1839,
               when De Quincey printed a substantially revised version in <em>Tait’s Edinburgh Magazine</em> (see n3).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               “Elegiac Stanzas”
               on the Greens (see n2), first appeared in Thomas De Quincey’s 
               “Sketches of Life and Manners; from the Autobiography of an English Opium Eater”
               (<em>Tait’s Edinburgh Magazine</em>, Sept. 1839, 573). Upon republishing this essay in his <em>Recollections of the Lakes and the Lake Poets</em>, De Quincey added a lengthy account of the Greens’ tragic deaths (see <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/dw/editions.2022.dw.greens-intro.html">introduction to this section</a> for further details).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
