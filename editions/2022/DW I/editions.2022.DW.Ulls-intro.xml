            <p>On 6 November 1805, just as mild weather gave way to autumn rain, Dorothy and William
                Wordsworth set out to see their friends Charles and Letitia Luff in Patterdale, 12
                miles northeast of Grasmere on the southern tip of Ullswater.<note place="end" rend="editors">Composing in the form of a journal, DW divides her account into days. However, as often happens in her journals, she mistakes the dates. As noted, she and WW left Grasmere on Wednesday, 6 November (not on 7 November, as stated in her manuscripts) and returned on the night of Tuesday, 12 November. Therefore, when DW mentions a date, readers should simply subtract one, though she is accurate in identifying the days of the week.</note>
                They planned for only a short visit but ended up spending a week exploring what
                Dorothy called the “wonderful country” around England’s second-largest lake.<note place="end" rend="editors">

                observations and experiences in genial prose. Since many of the landmarks she
                mentions remain today, much of what she saw appears in our <ref
                    target="https://byu.maps.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=c0039276837c4546a75a48bea2888385&extent=-3.6532,54.4011,-2.0547,54.8480">interactive

            <p>Dorothy’s Ullswater tour was essentially a counterclockwise circuit of the lake
                punctuated by side excursions. Afterward, she summarized her itinerary for her
                friend Catherine Clarkson: “William and I spent three days at Luff’s and three at
                Park house.<note place="end" resp="editors">Park House was Thomas Hutchinson’s home near the northern end of Ullswater (1804––1808). His sisters Sara and Joanna kept house for him.</note>
                We went the Wednesday after you left us—walked with Thomas Wilkinson through the
                Lowther woods—a marvelously beautiful walk. . . . We rode to Park House under
                Stybarrow Crag, and the day before we were also in Martindale with the
                Luffs—crossing over the mountain back to Patterdale.”<note place="end" resp="editors">
                            See Letters, 1:646
                            47 (2425 November 1805). </hi></p></note></hi>
                If we add that the siblings crossed the Kirkstone Pass (1,489 ft.—the Lake
                District’s highest road) to reach the Luffs’ and that six days later they marched
                down Ullswater’s long western shore and traversed Kirkstone again, we can imagine
                something like the trip’s full circle (see fig. 3.1). </p>

                                formula needs slight qualification in this case, given that DW was
                                not for the most part exploring new territory. She had been to
                                Ullswater many times, so the novelty of the trip had mainly to do
                                with circumstances. Still, she and WW wished to visit “some of the
                                vales tributary to Ullswater, where [they had] never been before”

                As Ernest de Sélincourt explained, her Scottish journal was “written at leisure
                after her return, while the events recorded were still vivid in her memory, and when
                she could see the whole tour in something of artistic perspective”; the same seems

                While Dorothy included some details from the trip in a letter she wrote on the
                trip’s second day [link to appendix, letter 1], she apparently waited until after
                her return to Grasmere to draft the full narrative.<hi rend="endnote_reference"

                                that she had been ill and quite busy, probably without much leisure
                                to write. Possibly she finished drafting the narrative in December
                                1805 or January 1806.</hi></p></note></hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why she wrote this account, and for whom, is not altogether clear. As the <hi
                    rend="italic">Grasmere Journals</hi> (1800<hi style="font-family:PT Sans"
                    >––</hi>1803) demonstrate, personal and shared memories routinely jostled
                together in her notebooks, and she often recorded experiences as potential sources
                for her own future writing or for William’s. In “Ullswater Excursion,” she records
                joyful moments with her brother, yet she clearly has an external audience in mind.
                She remarks in her report on day 2, “To attempt to <hi rend="italic">describe</hi>
                the place would be absurd when you for whom I write have been there, or may go
                thither as soon as you like.” Thus, her first intended reader (or readers) must have
                lived in or near the Lake District or had the means to visit easily. She might have
                said, as she later did concerning her Scottish tour, “I wrote my journal, or rather
                    <hi rend="italic">recollections</hi> for the sake of my Friends who it seemed
                ought to have been with us, but were confined at home by other duties.”<hi

                At this point, seemingly, she had no thoughts of print publication. </p>
            <p>In 1941, De Sélincourt speculated that Dorothy wrote “Ullswater Excursion” for Lady
                Margaret Beaumont, citing William’s 1823 explanation that it “was written for one
                acquainted with the general features of the country.”<hi rend="endnote_reference"
                        ><note place="end"><p rend="endnote text">

                In light of the letters Dorothy sent to Lady Beaumont during and just after the
                Ullswater tour, she was likely the one of whom William spoke (see section appendix
                [link]). Although the two women had yet to meet in person, they had been carrying on
                a warm correspondence.<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note place="end"><p

I have the same kind of pleasure in thinking of you as if I had really seen you, I am reminded of you by things daily before our eyes, just as if you had been often with us, had frequented the same paths and were familiar with the retired places of our valley” (</hi><hi

                        </p></note></hi> Perhaps Lady Beaumont, enthused by Dorothy’s letters, had
                asked for a longer, more circumstantial account of her adventure. She and her
                husband, Sir George, were generous patrons as well as friends to the Wordsworths, so
                Dorothy was understandably eager to please them. “Ullswater Excursion” might, then,
                be read as a reciprocal gift offered in a spirit of gratitude. </p>
            <p>As detailed more fully in Section II, two manuscript versions of “Ullswater
                Excursion” survive. The first, preserved in one of Dorothy’s notebooks, is slightly
                longer and somewhat messier, while the second—a fair copy likely prepared for Lady
                Beaumont—removes some details while offering clarifications and stylistic
                adjustments. Regrettably, we know little about the manuscripts’ use or possible
                circulation. Our primary clues about their reception are the simple facts already
                related: one copy was carefully preserved by the Beaumonts, and the other, retained
                by Dorothy herself, remained significant in Wordsworth family memory. William
                thought highly enough of it to make it part of his Lakeland guidebook, and, years
                later, nephew Christopher mentioned it in his 1851 <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of
                    William Wordsworth</hi>, acknowledging the authorship of his aunt.<hi

            <p>Dorothy composed “Ullswater Excursion” at a time distinguished by creative
                accomplishment but also by personal and family worries. She left a good deal unsaid.
                For instance, when she reports that “Derwent ran to meet us,” informed readers
                should picture a five-year-old who has not seen his father for almost two years,
                eager to embrace some of the most important adults in his life. The missing father,
                Samuel Taylor Coleridge, appears by name at only one point, yet his perplexing
                absence hangs in the air. Then, to acknowledge another powerful absence, when
                Dorothy describes coming in view of “the mountains above Grisedale,” ostensibly
                making the plainest sort of topographical reference, she unavoidably has in mind her
                beloved brother John—Captain John Wordsworth, who died in a shipwreck in February.
                It was near Grisedale Tarn that she and William parted with him after his last visit
                to Grasmere, bidding farewell as he rushed down the Ullswater side of the mountains,
                full of hope about his coming voyage on the <hi rend="italic">Earl of
                    Abergavenny</hi>. It was there, too, that William had found a vent for his
                feelings in early June, composing an elegy through tears.<hi

                As Dorothy exclaimed in her 9 June letter to Lady Beaumont, “Oh! My dear Friend, you
                will not wonder that we love that place.”<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note

                Similarly, when in “Ullswater Excursion” she recounts the tale of two local brothers
                drowning (thus explaining the name of “Brothers Water”), it seems unimaginable that
                she isn’t also reflecting on the recent drowning of her own brother. And might she
                not also think of him when she describes learning about the death of Admiral Nelson
                at Trafalgar?<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note place="end"><p rend="endnote text"
                                ><hi style="font-size:11pt" xml:space="preserve"> In her 29 November letter to Lady Beaumont, DW recalls that the sudden news of Nelson’s death caused her to burst into tears.

            </p>
            <p>Indeed, with all of these interweaving stories in mind, Dorothy’s “Ullswater
                Excursion,” for all its frankness, actually seems reticent. Most of its emotional
                iceberg remains underwater. Then again, Dorothy apparently had no need to explain
                such personal contexts to her first readers. Perhaps an implicit understanding of
                circumstances was part of what she had in mind when she wrote to Lady Beaumont on 29
                November, “To make [our daily goings-on and my own peculiar feelings] interesting
                love must be in your heart.”<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note place="end"><p

            <p>Because Dorothy’s original readers (in manuscript) must have been relatively few, the
                reception of the Ullswater text becomes easier to follow once it finds its way into
                print. Both of Dorothy’s “excursions”—“Excursion up Scawfell Pike” (1818) <hi

                (1805)—have been widely admired since they first appeared, respectively, in the
                third (1822) and fourth (1823) editions of William’s <hi rend="italic">Guide to the
                    Lakes</hi>. Though written some 13 years apart, these texts were forever linked
                by being placed alongside each other (and similarly transformed) in all editions or

                At the 1883 gathering of the Wordsworth Society, Stopford Brooke attempted to
                support his argument about William’s propensity for “falling into the modes of

            <p>On one level, the Wordsworth siblings’ journey to Ullswater was a house-hunting trip.
                Fond as they were of Dove Cottage, it was becoming too small for the growing family
                and its regular house guests, especially in the wintertime, when everyone spent more
                time indoors. In November 1805, William and Mary had two children under the age of
                three and were expecting their third.<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note place="end"
                            ><p rend="endnote text"

                Moreover, they longed to become homeowners, as evidenced in numerous letters from
                this period contemplating possible locations and building projects. An early
                highlight of the trip to Ullswater, then, was inspecting Broad How, an attractive
                lot for sale near the Luffs’ home in Patterdale. Almost immediately, as Dorothy’s
                account chronicles, they began imagining a dream home there, and to that end William
                visited their friend Thomas Wilkinson to ask for help negotiating the purchase of
                this property.<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note place="end"><p rend="endnote text"

DW writes in the more detailed account, “Our fancies could not resist the temptation &amp; we fixed upon a spot for a cottage which we began to build &amp; finished as easily as castles are raised in the air.” </hi></p></note></hi>
                Ultimately, with the help of Lord Lowther, William did purchase it in 1806. He held
                on to this plot for nearly 30 years but never did remodel the old home that stood
                there or build a new one.<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note place="end"><p

                                on the evening of Saturday, 9 November, after leaving DW at Park
                                House. Then WW and DW (along with SH and one of the Misses Green)
                                returned to Wilkinson’s house on Monday, 11 November on their way to
                                visit Lowther Woods, taking Wilkinson as their guide. WW walked
                                Wilkinson home that evening while DW and the others waited at Red
                                Hill. No doubt the men talked business. WW and DW returned to
                                Grasmere on the following day, apparently confident that their
                                property negotiations would be in good hands. In the end, the deal
                                did not transpire exactly as WW wished, but he reluctantly accepted
                                the terms. Lord Lowther put up £1,000, though WW had said the land
                                was worth no more than £800.</hi></p></note></hi> To alleviate the
                crowding problem in Grasmere, the Wordsworths spent the winter of 1806<hi
                    style="font-family:PT Sans">––</hi>1807 at Coleorton as guests of the Beaumonts,
                and in 1808 they moved from Dove Cottage to Allan Bank. </p>
            <p>“Ullswater Excursion” also records the Wordsworths taking strength from their
                extended network of friends and family, including the Hutchinsons at Park House and
                Captain John Wordsworth at Brougham Hall. (Captain Wordsworth was the kinsman who
                mentored their late brother in his sailor’s trade.) Yet, while never concealing that
                their trip was as much about domestic affairs and business as pleasure, Dorothy used
                the material at hand to create a first-rate piece of travel writing. She was fond of
                Ullswater because, as she told Lady Beaumont, it had not yet been spoiled by “fancy
                builders” and was “full of visions of things . . . that might have employed our
                fancy happily for hours, if they had not in the next moment been replaced by others
                as beautiful.”<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note place="end"><p rend="endnote text">

                And, like many of the age’s best travel narratives, Dorothy’s recounts experiencing
                a distinctive region chiefly on foot. Nature walks were of course among the
                Wordsworth siblings’ favorite pastimes, and, true to form, Dorothy managed to cover
                some 75 miles in six days, with only occasional breaks riding her pony (a recent
                gift from her oldest brother, Richard) or cruising in the Luffs’ rowboat. As Dorothy
                would afterward quip, her stamina left both herself and her brother “boast[ing] of
                [her] wonderful strength.”<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note place="end"><p
                            rend="endnote text">

            <p>If anything, Dorothy’s delight in the journey increased as it became more ambitious.
                Though confessedly reluctant to embark from Grasmere on a “damp and gloomy morning,”
                she reported that “as the mists thickened” over Kirkstone Pass, “[their] enjoyments
                increased.” On subsequent days—usually with William and sometimes also with their
                friends—she explored the lake’s southeastern shore, hiked over the mountains from
                Martindale to Patterdale, wandered through the Lowther Woods and the familiar
                streets of Penrith, and twice trekked the full length of Ullswater. On the final day
                alone, she and William walked or rode approximately 23 miles, all after 3:00 p.m.
                After coming back across Kirkstone by starlight, she and William arrived at Dove
                Cottage long after Mary and the children had gone to bed. </p>
            <p>For Dorothy, this had been a genuine holiday, one reminiscent of tramps undertaken in
                earlier years, when she and her brother spent much of their lives walking, talking,
                and planning the future together. It must also have sparked memories of previous
                Ullswater visits, including their famed encounter with the daffodils beside the lake
                in 1802, when William was settling his affairs with Annette Vallon and preparing to
                wed Mary Hutchinson. Grounded, then, in feelings both present and past, “Ullswater
                Excursion” offers some of Dorothy’s most luminous writing. Over two centuries later,
                it still lingers in the ear and on the mind’s eye: “At such a time and in such a
                place every scattered stone the size of one’s head becomes a companion”; “Place-Fell
                steady and bold as a lion; the whole lake driving onward like a great river”; “We
                observed the lemon-coloured leaves of the birches . . . as the wind turned them to
                the sun, sparkle, or rather flash, like diamonds”; “The stars in succession took
                their stations on the mountain-tops”; “All the cheerfulness of the scene was in the
                sky.” These passages and others like them await the reader of “Excursion on the
                Banks of Ullswater,” which this edition presents with thorough annotations and
                illustrations.</p></div>

            <p>As noted previously, “Excursion on the Banks of Ullswater” survives in two
                manuscripts. The first, Dove Cottage Manuscript 51 (DCMS 51) is a hand-sewn notebook
                containing both prose and verse (fig. 3.3). This notebook preserves various
                materials related to the Ullswater text, including five pages of draft fragments
                (pp. 1<hi style="font-family:PT Sans">––</hi>5) plus two experimental introductions
                (pp. 18<hi style="font-family:PT Sans">––</hi>20) that helped produce the 1823 <hi
                    rend="italic">Guide to the Lakes</hi>. Its complete copy of the Ullswater
                narrative (pp. 21<hi style="font-family:PT Sans">––</hi>34) is the earliest known.
                Like “Excursion up Scawfell Pike,” it shows multiple sets of revisions, some in pen
                and some (later) in pencil. The base layer is in Dorothy’s hand, while edits appear
                in her handwriting but possibly also in William’s. We ignore the penciled edits in
                our apparatus, seeking so far as possible to emphasize Dorothy’s own work rather
                than trace the evolution of William’s <hi rend="italic">Guide</hi>. Still, all of
                the edits, along with the separate fragments and draft introductions, are arguably
                important for the reception history of Dorothy’s writing, and readers can see the
                results of the multistage revision process in our transcription of the 1823 <hi

                and supposing (with De Sélincourt) that it was made for Lady Beaumont, who for much
                of her life resided at Coleorton Hall in Leicestershire. Added support for their
                surmise comes from the manuscript itself, which features, at the top of its first
                page, a descriptive note in another hand: “a mountainous ramble by D Wordsworth
                sister to <hi rend="underline">the poet</hi>.” While it is difficult to draw certain
                conclusions based on a 10-word sample, this appears to be the handwriting of Lady
                Beaumont. </p>
            <p>In this attractive document, Dorothy edits the DCMS 51 text or a closely related
                draft for style and accuracy. Notably, she removes her account (from 11 November,
                day 6) of walking in Penrith at night, seeing old acquaintances, and revisiting
                familiar haunts. Perhaps she considered this tour of sites linked to her adolescence
                too private or just uninteresting for her likely readers.<hi

                                The two became close when, as an orphaned teenager, DW lived in
                                Penrith with her stern maternal grandparents. At that time, the

            <p>In William’s <hi rend="italic">Guide</hi>, “Ullswater Excursion” gains acceptability
                for a general audience but loses some of its personality. As De Sélincourt
                succinctly puts it, “Dorothy wrote a journal of this tour which her brother
                afterwards recast and appended to his <hi rend="italic">Guide to the Lakes</hi>: few
                readers will prefer his more formal, ‘literary’ version to Dorothy’s.”<hi

                for its purpose and embellished with a few novel passages. Nonetheless, Dorothy’s
                original is warmer, more detailed, and generally more engaging. This is true not
                only because of what De Sélincourt calls her “vivid beauty of feeling and

                    rend="italic">Guide</hi>, even if slightly altered—but also because of the
                intimacy of her report, which lends it human interest that might actually be out of
                place in a guidebook.</p>
            <p rend="annotation text">As in the case of “Excursion Up Scawfell Pike,” the first
                thing one notices in comparing Dorothy’s manuscript text to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Guide</hi>’s adaptation is that the latter is shorter and less personal. All of
                the individuals are missing: no “dear Coleridge,” no Luffs, no Hutchinsons, no
                Thomas Wilkinson. Even the pony is gone, and that seems a shame; the poor beast is
                an important character, if only for what he reveals about Dorothy, whose sympathy
                toward animals, both wild and domesticated, comes through strongly in the
                manuscripts. </p>
            <p rend="annotation text">Overall, then, the social nature of this tour becomes obscured
                in William’s retelling.<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note place="end"><p

However, manuscript evidence somewhat complicates this simple division of responsibility. DCMS 51 shows late-stage edits in DW’s hand as well as WW’s. Given that DW and WW worked on revisions for the </hi><hi rend="italic" style="font-size:11pt" xml:space="preserve">Guide </hi><hi style="font-size:11pt" xml:space="preserve">together (though certain new passages are unambiguously his), we should consider the possibility that edits for publication sometimes represented DW’s intention. </hi></p></note></hi>
                To be sure, William often adopts the first-person plural, as in “We left Grasmere
                vale,” “We noticed, as we passed,” and “The mists gathered as we went along”—his
                narrator does not wander lonely as a cloud. Nonetheless, his “we” remain basically
                anonymous. His formal “We were more than contented,” describing the travelers’ wet
                crossing of the Kirkstone Pass, is far less evocative than Dorothy’s report of
                brother and sister cheerfully advancing through the mist, “as happy Travellers as
                ever paced side by side on a holiday ramble.” Lamentably, the changes made for the
                    <hi rend="italic">Guide</hi>, necessary as they might be to preserve privacy,
                tend to obscure the core relationship that drives the text: the partnership of the
                siblings, who must hold even more tightly to each other now that brother John is
                gone and the “set is . . . broken.”<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note place="end"><p

            <p rend="annotation text">That close partnership helps explain a blunt fact that
                frequently troubles today’s readers: William published a substantial work by his
                sister without acknowledging the fact. Even devoted Victorian Wordsworthians could
                find this appropriation odd, as did Knight in his 1889 biography of the poet:
                “[Wordsworth] concluded [the <hi rend="italic">Guide</hi>] by incorporating the
                whole, or nearly the whole, of his sister’s journal, without any indication to the

                        </p></note></hi> We feel certain that William did so with her cooperation;
                “Wordsworth” was the family brand, and Dorothy regularly did what she could to
                support it, contributing to her own financial security as well as her brother’s
                    reputation.<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note place="end"><p rend="endnote text"

                The result was a substantially coauthored <hi rend="italic">Guide to the Lakes</hi>,
                even if it was not publicly acknowledged as such. With her intimate knowledge of the

            <p>As noted previously, this edition includes an annotated and illustrated text [link]
                plus transcriptions of the two surviving manuscripts [links] and the 1823 <hi

                text is based on the Coleorton Manuscript, but we supply key omitted passages, known
                from DCMS 51, in the notes. We retain Dorothy’s idiosyncratic spelling and
                punctuation; therefore, readers should be aware that several place names differ from
                those found on modern maps (e.g., “Boar Dale” for “Boredale,” “Emont” for “Eamont,”
                “Glenriddin” for “Glenridding,” “Gowborough” for “Gowbarrow,” “Sanwick” for
                “Sandwick,” and “Yanworth” for “Yanwath”). For clarity, we expand abbreviated
                    names—“W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi>” to “William,” “Sara H.” to “Sara
                Hutchinson,” “T. Wilkinson” to “Thomas Wilkinson”—and regularize “Mr.” and “Mrs.” in
                US style, adding a period and using no superscripts. </p>
