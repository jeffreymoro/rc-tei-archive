                <div type="section">
                    <head>2nd Edition (2020)</head>
                <p rend="noCount">Since this <title level="j">Romantic Circles</title> edition of William Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide to the 
                    Lakes</title> first appeared in July 2015, our ongoing research has yielded enough new discoveries and insights about the 
                    text’s complex origins, publication history, and afterlives as to necessitate, in our minds, a revised second edition. While 
                    several resources remain largely unchanged—notably our fully annotated, 
                    illustrated text of the 1835 edition and the bibliographic, cartographic, and textual tools for studying the <title 
                        level="m">Guide</title>—we have significantly reworked, extended, and, in some cases, corrected our earlier account 
                    of the essay’s origins, composition, and initial publication. The most significant changes to the critical apparatus 
                    come in our introduction, which incorporates several important findings, and a new appendix offering the most detailed 
                    study to date of the <ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/editions.2020.guide_lakes.serialpublication.html">serial publication of 
                    <title level="m">Select Views</title></ref>. We have also added a new section featuring high-resolution scans of 
                    Wordsworth’s <ref target="/editions/guide_lakes/letterpress_gallery">1810 letterpress</ref> 
                    and silently corrected minor transcription and labeling errors in our earlier edition.</p></div>
            <div type="section"><head>1st Edition (2015)</head>
                <p rend="noCount">First published in 1810 and repeatedly revised by its author over the ensuing 25 years, Wordsworth’s <title 
                    level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> has long been considered a crucial text for scholars of Romantic-era aesthetics, 
                    ecology, travel writing, and tourism. Though the fifth edition of 1835 (the last revised by Wordsworth) has remained 
                    available in reprints and scholarly editions, earlier editions of the <title level="m">Guide</title> continue to be 
                    scarce. This is particularly true of the original 1810 version, which appeared as an anonymous prose supplement to a 
                    set of Lake District sketches by the Rev. Joseph Wilkinson.</p>
                <p rend="noCount">This new digital edition therefore aims to provide scholars, students, and general readers easy and open access to key 
                    editions of the <title level="m">Guide</title> from Wordsworth’s lifetime, including full scans of Wilkinson’s 1810 
                    sketches and Wordsworth’s 1810 and 1835 texts. Accompanying these primary works is an extensive scholarly apparatus, 
                    including a historical and textual introduction to the <title level="m">Guide</title>; detailed hypertext notes on 
                    Wordsworth’s essay; an annotated bibliography of previous scholarly editions and criticism on the <title 
                        level="m">Guide</title>; and excerpts from letters by Wordsworth and his circle addressing the work’s production, 
                    reception, and revision.</p>
                <p rend="noCount">Taking advantage of digital technologies, we have also included a parallel-text chart tracking Wordsworth’s sequential 
                    revisions over five editions between 1810 and 1835; dozens of maps, engravings, and photographs of the Lakes; and a 
                    geo-tracking feature that allows readers to pinpoint locations discussed in the <title level="m">Guide</title> with 
                    the click of a mouse. All told, then, this site combines the traditional features of a serious scholarly edition with 
                    digital tools that offer a fresh, and hopefully fuller, experience with one of Wordsworth’s most illuminating, 
                    challenging, and compelling works.</p></div></div>

                <p rend="noCount">Numerous students, colleagues, Wordsworth scholars, and enthusiasts have lent their time, talents, and expertise to 
                    this edition. Emily Young and Rachel Wise, who were then remarkable BYU undergraduates, helped launch our research 
                    and transcriptions in 2011 and 2012. At <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title>, Dave Rettenmaier has provided 
                    technical expertise and design savvy from the beginning; Tilar Mazzeo shepherded our 2015 edition from proposal to 
                    release; Michele Speitz spearheaded the publication of this 2019 version; and Neil Fraistat, Steven Jones, Orrin 
                    Wang, and Paul Youngquist have offered unwavering support at the executive level.</p>
                <p rend="noCount">At our home campus, BYU, the English Department, Office of Digital Humanities, and Center for the Study of Europe 
                    provided generous financial support for research and travel, and a university Mentoring Environment Grant allowed us to 
                    hire student collaborators and take them on a week-long research trip to the Lake District.</p>
                <p rend="noCount">For years of enthusiastic support and expert responses to obscure queries, special gratitude is in order for Jeff 
                    Cowton, MBE, head curator at the Wordsworth Trust. Dating to a memorable afternoon in the Jerwood Centre during the 
                    spring of 2011, Jeff’s generosity has not only yielded more authoritative editions but also institutional 
                    partnerships that have enriched hundreds of lives at BYU. Warm thanks also to the Wordsworth Trust’s assistant curators, 
                    Rebecca Turner and Melissa Mitchell, for cheerful, timely assistance with countless queries sent from Provo to 
                    Grasmere over the better part of a decade.</p>
                <p rend="noCount">Others who have been especially generous with their time, resources, and expertise include Ed Vermue, special 
                    collections and preservation librarian of the Oberlin College Library, who provided the high-resolution scan 
                    of <title level="m">Smith’s New and Accurate Map of the Lakes</title> (1800); Maggie Kopp and Russ Taylor, special 
                    collections librarians at BYU who facilitated access to early editions of the <title level="m">Guide</title> and 
                    many other key resources; Joel Silver of the Lilly Library at Indiana University, who supplied high-resolution scans 
                    of the 1810 <title level="m">Select Views</title>; Patrick Vincent of the University of Neuchâtel and Bernhard Jenny 
                    of Oregon State University, who helped us along the trail of the Pfyffer terrain relief; Mark L. Reed, emeritus 
                    professor of English from the University of North Carolina, whose generosity, unrivalled knowledge, and bibliographic 
                    expertise saved us from countless potential errors; Elisabeth Fairman, chief curator of rare books and manuscripts at 
                    the Yale Center for British Art, who spent an afternoon helping us study the FitzRoy copy of <title level="m">Select 
                        Views</title>; James Baker, Matthew Crowther, and, especially, John Ford, who generously offered their published 
                    and unpublished research on and vast knowledge of Rudolph Ackermann; Sarah Barlow, a BYU student who voluntarily 
                    assisted with illustrations and permissions; John Talbot, our departmental colleague and resident Latinist; Jean-Robert 
                    Durbin of the Huntington Library’s Rare Book Department; John Mustain, rare books librarian at Stanford University; 
                    Emma Darbyshire of the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge; and Kaitlyn Krieg of the Morgan Library and Museum.</p>
