                transcription is based on a 16-page fair copy of <title level="a">Ullswater Excursion</title> in Dorothy
                Wordsworth’s hand that seems to have been made for Lady Margaret Beaumont sometime
                in late 1805 or early 1806. It is known as the <title level="a">Coleorton Manuscript</title> both in
                reference to the Beaumonts’ Leicestershire estate, Coleorton Hall, and its being
                part of the Coleorton Papers at the Morgan Library in New York City. The manuscript
                (catalog #MA 1581) bears a descriptive title, “a mountainous ramble by D Wordsworth
                sister to <hi rend="underline">the poet,</hi>” likely added by Lady Beaumont.
                    <note place="foot" resp="editors">This label appears to be in Lady Beaumont’s 
                        hand, though the rest of the manuscript is in DW’s own best handwriting.

                <l>Coleridge, when either he or William observed that</l>
                <l>the rocky shore spotted and streaked with purplish</l>
                <l>brown heath and its image in the water together</l>
                <l>were like an immense catterpillar, such as when</l>
                <l>we were children we used to call <hi rend="underline">Woolly Boys</hi>,</l>
                <l>from their hairy coats. I had been a little coward</l>
                <l>-ly when we left home, fearing that heavy rains</l>
                <l>might detain us at Patterdale; but as the mists</l>
                <l>thickened our enjoyment encreased, and my hopes</l>
                <l>grew bolder; and when we were at the top of </l>
                <l>Kirkstone (though we could not see fifty yards</l>
                <l>before us) we were as happy Travellers as ever</l>
                <l>paced side by side on a holiday ramble. At</l>
                <l>such a time and in such a place every scat-</l>
                <l>-tered stone the size of one’s head becomes a com</l>
                <l>-panion: there is a fragment of an old wall at</l>
                <l>the top of Kirkstone, which, magnified yet ob</l>
                <l>-scured as it was by the mist, was scarcely less</l>
                <l>interesting to us when we cast our eyes upon it</l>
                <l>than the view of a noble monument of anci</l>
                <l>-ent grandeur has been – yet this same pile</l>
                <l>of stones we had never before observed. When</l>
                <l>we had descended considerably the fields of Hartsop</l>
                <l>below Brotherswater were first seen, like a Lake </l>

                <l>mistook them for the water; but soon after we saw</l>
                <l>the Lake itself gleaming faintly with a grey steely</l>
                <l>brightness; then appeared the brown oaks, and the</l>
                <l>birches of splendid colour, and, when we came still</l>
                <l>nearer to the valley, the cottages under their tufts</l>
                <l>of trees and the old Hall of Hartsop with its long</l>
                <l>irregular front and elegant chimneys. We had</l>
                <l>eaten our dinner under the shelter of a Sheep-fold</l>
                <l>by the bridge at the foot of the mountain,</l>
                <l>having tethered the pony at the entrance, where</l>
                <l>it stood without one impatient beating of a</l>
                <l>foot – I could not but love it for its meekness,</l>
                <l>and indeed I thought we were selfish to enjoy</l>
                <l>our meal so heartily while his poor jaws were</l>
                <l>tethered by the curb bridle. We reached M<hi rend="sup">r</hi></l>

                <l>the side of the hill above our heads; four or</l>

                <l>black Yew Trees on the crag above Luff’s house were</l>
                <l>striking objects, close under or seen through the </l>
                <l>flying mists. I do not know what to say of</l>
                <l>Blowick; for to attempt to <hi rend="underline">describe</hi> the place</l>
                <l>would be absurd when you for whom I write have</l>
                <l>been there, or may go thither as soon as you like.</l>
                <l>When we stood upon the naked Crag upon the Com</l>

                fields,</l>
                <l>the Lake, Clouds, and Mists were all in motion to</l>
                <l>the sound of sweeping winds – the Church and Cottages</l>
                <l>of Patterdale scarcely visible from the brightness</l>
                <l>of the thin mist. Looking backwards toward</l>

                <l>-quently both in going and returning to look at</l>
                <l>the exquisite beauty of the woods opposite. The</l>

                <l>the hollow places in the highest part of the woods, the</l>
                <l>trees were of a yellow colour, and, through the glittering</l>

                <l>them gathered together in the West, and tinged with</l>
                <l>the golden light of the sun. After dinner we walk</l>
                <l>-ed with M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Luff up the Vale; I had never had an</l>
                <l>idea of the extent and width of it in passing thro’</l>
                <l>along the road on the other side. We walked along</l>
                <l>the path which leads from house to house; two or</l>
                <l>three times it took us through some of those copses</l>
                <l>or groves that cover every little hillock in the mid</l>
                <l>-dle of the lower part of the Vale, making an</l>
                <l>intricate and beautiful intermixture of lawn and</l>
                <l>woodland. We left William to prolong his walk; and when</l>

                <l>when the moon had climbed up to the middle of the</l>

                <l>a little after that time, it being likely for a tolera-</l>
                <l>-bly fine day, we packed up bread and cold meat, and,</l>
                <l>with Luff’s servant to help to row, set forward in the</l>
                <l>Boat. As we proceeded the day grew finer – clouds</l>
                <l>and sunny gleams on the mountains. In a grand</l>
                <l>Bay under Place Fell we saw three Fishermen with</l>
                <l>a Boat dragging a net, and rowed up to them.</l>
                <l>They had just brought the net ashore, and hun</l>
                <l>-dreds of fish were leaping in their prison. They</l>
                <l>were all of one kind, what are called Skellies.</l>
                <l>After we had left them the Fishermen continu</l>
                <l>-ed their work, a picturesque group under the</l>
                <l>lofty and bare crags; the whole scene was very</l>
                <l>grand, a raven croaking on the mountain above</l>
                <l>our heads. – Landed at Sanwick – the man took</l>
                <l>the Boat home, and we pursued our journey</l>
                <l>towards the village along a beautiful summer</l>
                <l>path, at first through a copse by the Lake</l>
                <l>side, then through green fields – the Village and</l>
                <l>Brook very pretty, shut out from mountains and</l>
                <l>Lakes – it reminded me of Somersetshire – Passed</l>
                <l>by Harry Hebson’s house – I longed to go in for</l>

                <l>of the Vale and we the other, and he joined us</l>
                <l>after having crossed the one-arched bridge above the</l>
                <l>Church – a beautiful view of the church with its </l>
                <l>“bare ring of mossy wall” and single Yew Tree. At</l>
                <l>the last house in the Vale we were kindly</l>
                <l>greeted by the Master, who was sitting at the door</l>
                <l>salving sheep – he invited us to go in and see a </l>
                <l>room lately built by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hazel for his accommo</l>
                <l>-dation at the yearly chace of red Deer in his</l>
                <l>Forests at the head of these Dales; the room is fit-</l>
                <l>-ted up in the sportsman’s style, with a single cup-</l>
                <l>-board for bottles and glasses &amp;c, some strong chairs, and</l>
                <l>a large dining-table; and ornamented with the horns </l>
                <l>of the stags caught at these Hunts for many years</l>
                <l>back, with the length of the last race they ran</l>
                <l>recorded under each. We ate our dinner here; the</l>
                <l>good woman treated us with excellent butter and new</l>
                <l>oat bread, and, after drinking some of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hazel’s</l>
                <l>strong Ale we were well prepared to face the</l>
                <l>mountain, which we began to climb almost immedi-</l>
                <l>-ately. Martindale divides itself into two dales</l>
                <l>at the head. In one of these (that to the left)</l>
                <l>there is no house to be seen, nor any building</l>
                <l>but a cattle shed on the side of a hill which</l>
                <l>is sprinkled over with wood, evidently the remains </l>
                <l>of a Forest, formerly a very extensive one. At</l>
                <l>the bottom of the other Valley is the house of which</l>

                <l>Farm there are no other. A few old trees remain, relicks</l>
                <l>of the Forest, a little stream passes in serpentine wind-</l>
                <l>-ings through the uncultivated valley, where many Cattle</l>
                <l>were feeding – the Cattle of this country are generally</l>
                <l>white or light-coloured; but those were mostly dark</l>
                <l>brown or black, which made the scene resemble ma-</l>
                <l>-ny parts of Scotland. When we sate on the hill-</l>
                <l>-side, though we were well contented with the quiet</l>
                <l>every-day sounds, the lowing of cattle, bleating of</l>
                <l>sheep, and the very gentle murmuring of the valley</l>
                <l>stream, yet we could not but think what a grand</l>
                <l>effect the sound of the Bugle Horn would have</l>
                <l>among these mountains. It is still heard once</l>
                <l>a year at the Chace I have spoken of, a day</l>
                <l>of festivity for all the Inhabitants of this Dis-</l>
                <l>trict except the poor Deer, the most ancient </l>
                <l>of them all. The ascent, even to the top of the</l>
                <l>mountain, is very easy. When we had accomplish-</l>
                <l>-ed it we had some exceedingly fine mountain</l>
                <l>views, some of the mountains being resplendent</l>
                <l>with sunshine, others partly hidden by clouds. </l>
                <l>Ulswater was of a dazzling brightness bordered by</l>
                <l>black hills – the plain beyond Penrith smooth</l>
                <l>and bright, (or rather <hi rend="underline">gleamy</hi>) as the sea or sea</l>
                <l>Sands. Looked into Boar Dale above Sanwick,</l>
                <l>deep and bare, a stream winding down it. After</l>
                <l>having walked a considerable way on the tops of</l>
                <l>the hills, came in view of Glenriddin and the </l>

            <lb/>
                <l>mountains above Grisdale. Luff then took us aside,</l>
                <l>before we had begun to descend, to a small Ruin</l>
                <l>which was formerly a Chapel or place of worship</l>
                <l>where the Inhabitants of Martindale and Patterdale</l>
                <l>were accustomed to meet on Sabbath days. There</l>
                <l>are now no traces by which you could discover</l>
                <l>that the Building had been different from a com-</l>
                <l>-mon sheep-fold; the loose stones, and the few</l>
                <l>which yet remain piled up are the same as</l>
                <l>those which lie about on the mountain; but</l>
                <l>the shape of the building, being oblong, is not</l>
                <l>that of a common sheep-fold, and it stands East</l>
                <l>and West. Whether it was ever consecrated ground</l>
                <l>or not I know not; but the place may be kept</l>
                <l>holy in the memory of some now living in Pat-</l>
                <l>-terdale; for it was the means of preserving the </l>
                <l>life of a poor old man last summer who, hav-</l>

                <l>been overtaken by a storm, and could not</l>
                <l>find his way down again. He happened to be</l>
                <l>near the remains of the old Chapel, and, in </l>
                <l>a corner of it, he contrived, by laying turf and</l>
                <l>ling and stones from one wall to the other, to</l>
                <l>make a shelter from the wind, and there he</l>

                <l>night and the neighbours went out to seek him.</l>
                <l>At that time the old Man had housed himself in</l>
                <l>his nest, and he heard the voices of the men; but</l>
                <l>could not make <hi rend="underline">them</hi> hear, the wind being so loud,</l>
                <l>and he was afraid to leave the spot least he </l>
                <l>should not ^be able to find it again, so he remained</l>
                <l>there all night, and they returned to their homes</l>
                <l>giving him up for lost; but the next morning the</l>
                <l>same persons discovered him huddled up in the she[l]tered</l>
                <l>work. He was, at first, stupefied and unable to move;</l>
                <l>but after he had eaten and drunk, and recollected</l>
                <l>himself a little, he walked down the mountain, and did</l>
                <l>not afterwards seem to have suffered. As we descend,</l>
                <l>the Vale of Patterdale appears very simple and grand</l>
                <l>with its two heads, Deep-dale, and Brotherswater or Hart</l>
                <l>Hartsop. It is remarkable that two pairs of Bro-</l>
                <l>-thers should have been drowned in that Lake. There</l>
                <l>is a tradition, at least, that it took its name</l>
                <l>from two who were drowned there many years</l>
                <l>ago, and it is a fact that two others did meet</l>
                <l>that melancholy fate about twenty years since. </l>
                <l>It was upon a New-year’s Day. Their Mother had</l>
                <l>sent them to thresh some corn, and they, probably</l>
                <l>thinking it hard to be so tasked when all others</l>
                <l>were keeping holiday, stole out to slide upon</l>
                <l>the ice and were both drowned. A Neighbour who</l>
            <lb/>
                <l><hi rend="bold">[end page 10]</hi></l>
            <lb/>
                <l>who had seen them fall through the ice, though not near</l>
                <l>enough to be <hi rend="underline">certain</hi>, guessed who they were, and went</l>
                <l>to the mother to enquire after her sons. She replied</l>
                <l>that they were in the Barn threshing, “Nay,” said</l>
                <l>the Man, they are not there, I am sure, and it</l>
                <l>is not likely today.” The Woman went with</l>
                <l>him to the Barn and the Boys were gone:</l>
                <l>he was then confirmed, and told her that he believ-</l>
                <l>-ed that they were drowned. It is said that they</l>
                <l>were found locked in each other’s arms. I was</l>
                <l>exceedingly tired when we reached home, owing</l>
                <l>to the steepness and roughness of the peat track</l>
                <l>by which we descended. I lay down on the</l>
                <l>Sofa in M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Luff’s parlour and was asleep</l>
                <l>in three minutes - - - - -. A fine moonlight</l>
                <l>night – a thick fog in the middle of the</l>
                <l>Vale, which disheartened William about the</l>
                <l>situation of his house. Supped on some of the</l>
                <l>Fish caught by the Fishermen at the foot</l>
                <l>of Place Fell. We thought them excellent.</l>

                <hi rend="indent8"><l>A beautiful morning. When</l></hi>
                <l>we were at breakfast we heard suddenly the tidings</l>
                <l>of Lord Nelson’s death, and the Victory of Trafal-</l>
                <l>-gar. Went to the Inn to make further inquiries – </l>
                <l>I was shocked to hear that there had been great</l>

                <l>rejoicings at Penrith. Returned by William’s rock and</l>
                <l>grove, and were so much pleased with the spot that</l>
                <l>W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> determined to buy it if possible, therefore we

                <l>-ply to Thomas Wilkinson to negotiate for him</l>
                <l>with the owner. We went down that side of the </l>
                <l>Lake opposite to Stybarrow Crag: I dismounted,</l>
                <l>and we sate some time under the same rock as</l>
                <l>before, above Blowick. Owing to the brightness of</l>
                <l>the sunshine the Church and other buildings were</l>
                <l>even more concealed from us than by the mists</l>
                <l>the other day. It had been a sharp frost in the </l>
                <l>night, and the grass and trees were yet wet.</l>
                <l>We observed the lemon-coloured leaves of the birches</l>
                <l>in the wood below, as the wind turned them to the </l>
                <l>sun, sparkle, or rather <hi rend="underline">flash</hi>, like diamonds. The </l>
                <l>day continued unclouded to the end. We had a de-</l>
                <l>-lightful ride and walk, for it was both to both of </l>
                <l>us. We led the horse under Place Fell, &amp;, though</l>
                <l>I mostly rode when the way was good, William</l>
                <l>sometimes mounted to rest himself. Called at</l>
                <l>Eusemere. Went by Bower Bank, intending to</l>
                <l>ford the Emont at the Mill; but the pony would</l>
                <l>not carry us both, so, after many attempts, I rode</l>
                <l>over myself and a Girl followed me on another</l>
                <l>horse to take back the pony to William. Very cold </l>

                <l>before we reached Park House. Derwent ran to meet</l>
                <l>us. Sate in the kitchen till the parlour fire was</l>
                <l>lighted and then <hi rend="underline">enjoyed </hi>a comfortable
                    dish of tea.</l>

                <l>W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> and Miss Green set out on foot; but she</l>
                <l>had not walked long before she took a seat behind</l>

                <l>he chearfully laid down the spade and walked</l>
                <l>by our side with William. We left our horses at </l>
                <l>the Mill below Brougham, and walked through</l>
                <l>the woods till we came to the Quarry, where the</l>
                <l>road ends, the very place which has been the</l>
                <l>Boundary of some of the happiest of the walks</l>
                <l>of my youth. The sun did not shine when we were</l>
                <l>there; and it was mid-day, therefore if it had shone,</l>
                <l>the light could not have been the same; yet so</l>
                <l>vividly did I call to mind those walks that</l>
                <l>when I was in the wood I almost seemed to see</l>
                <l>the same rich light of evening upon the trees</l>
                <l>which I had seen in those happy hours. My heart </l>

                <l>was full; and I could not but grieve that any stran-</l>
                <l>-gers were with us. At this time the Path was scarce</l>
                <l>-ly traceable by the eye, all the ground being covered </l>
                <l>with withered leaves, which I was very sorry for, W<hi rend="sup">m</hi></l>

                <l>Scrambled along under the Quarry; then came to T.</l>
                <l>Wilkinson’s new path. We spent three delightful </l>
                <l>hours by the River side and in the woods. Called at</l>
                <l>Richard Bowman’s. We had a pleasant ride home;</l>
                <l>Sara and I stopped at Red Hills while William</l>
                <l>went over the Ford to T. Wilkinson’s. The House</l>
                <l>untidy and uncomfortable – a little Girl never</l>
                <l>ceased rocking the Baby in the cradle. We asked </l>
                <l>if it would not sleep without rocking, and the</l>
                <l>Mother said “No, for she was used to it” – Reached</l>

                <l>three we set forward. The pony was bogged in </l>
                <l>Tom’s field &amp; I was obliged to dismount – Went </l>

                <l>sun shone, and only a few scattered clouds remained</l>
                <l>on the hills except at the tops of the very highest –</l>
                <l>the Lake perfectly calm – We had a delightful jour-</l>
                <l>-ney. At the beginning of the first Park William</l>
                <l>got upon the pony, and, betwixt a walk and a</l>
                <l>run, I kept pace with him while he trotted to the</l>
                <l>next gate; then I mounted again. We were joined </l>
                <l>by two Travellers; like ourselves, with one white horse</l>
                <l>between them. We went on in company till we</l>
                <l>came near to Patterdale, trotting most of the</l>
                <l>time. The Trees in Gowborough Park were very beau-</l>
                <l>-tiful, the hawthorns leafless – their round heads cover-</l>
                <l>-ed with rich red berries, and adorned with arches of</l>
                <l>green brambles, and eglantine hung with glossy hips</l>
                <l>– Many birches yet tricked out in full foliage of</l>
                <l>bright yellow – Oaks brown or leafless – the smooth</l>
                <l>branches of the ashes bare – most of the alders green</l>
                <l>as in spring. I think I have more pleasure in look-</l>
                <l>-ing at deer than any other animals, perhaps chief-</l>
                <l>-ly from their living in a more natural state. At</l>
                <l>the end of Gowborough Park, A large Troop of them</l>
                <l>were moving slowly, or standing still, among the fern.</l>
                <l>I was grieved when our companions startled them with </l>
                <l>a whistle, disturbing a beautiful image of grave</l>
                <l>simplicity and thoughtful enjoyment; for I could</l>
                <l>have fancied that even they were partaking with</l>
                <l>me a sensation of the solemnity of the closing day. </l>

                <l>The sun had been set some time, though we could only</l>
                <l>just perceive that the daylight was partly gone, and</l>
                <l>the Lake was more brilliant than before. I dismount-</l>
                <l>-ed again at Stybarrow Crag, and William rode till</l>
                <l>we came almost to Glenriddin. Found the Luffs at </l>

                <l>accompanied me on foot and William continued to</l>

                <l>– A delightful evening – the Seven Stars close to</l>
                <l>the hill tops in Patterdale – all the stars seemed</l>
                <l>brighter than usual. The steeps were reflected in Bro-</l>
                <l>-thers-water, and above the Lake appeared like enormous black</l>
                <l>perpendicular walls. The torrents of Kirkstone had been</l>
                <l>swoln by the rains, and filled the mountain Pass</l>
                <l>with their roaring, which added greatly to the solem-</l>
                <l>-nity of our walk – the stars in succession took their</l>
                <l>stations on the mountain tops. Behind us, when we</l>
                <l>had climbed very high we saw one light in the Vale</l>
                <l>at a great distance, like a large star, a solitary</l>
                <l>one, in the gloomy region – all the cheerfulness of</l>
                <l>the scene was in the sky above us. Found Mary &amp;</l>

                <l>warm with walking, and I not cold; having wrap-</l>
