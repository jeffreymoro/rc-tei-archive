                Wordsworth&#8217;s hand that seems to have been made for Lady Margaret Beaumont sometime
                in late 1805 or early 1806. It is known as the <title level="a">Coleorton Manuscript</title> both in
                reference to the Beaumonts&#8217; Leicestershire estate, Coleorton Hall, and its being
                part of the Coleorton Papers at the Morgan Library in New York City. The manuscript
                (catalog #MA 1581) bears a descriptive title, &#8220;a mountainous ramble by D Wordsworth
                sister to <hi rend="underline">the poet,</hi>&#8221; likely added by Lady Beaumont.

                the rocky shore spotted and streaked with purplish<lb/>
                brown heath and its image in the water together<lb/>
                were like an immense catterpillar, such as when<lb/>
                we were children we used to call <hi rend="underline">Woolly Boys</hi>,<lb/>
                from their hairy coats. I had been a little coward<lb/>
                -ly when we left home, fearing that heavy rains<lb/>
                might detain us at Patterdale; but as the mists<lb/>
                thickened our enjoyment encreased, and my hopes<lb/>
                grew bolder; and when we were at the top of <lb/>
                Kirkstone (though we could not see fifty yards<lb/>
                before us) we were as happy Travellers as ever<lb/>
                paced side by side on a holiday ramble. At<lb/>
                such a time and in such a place every scat-<lb/>
                -tered stone the size of one&#8217;s head becomes a com<lb/>
                -panion: there is a fragment of an old wall at<lb/>
                the top of Kirkstone, which, magnified yet ob<lb/>
                -scured as it was by the mist, was scarcely less<lb/>
                interesting to us when we cast our eyes upon it<lb/>
                than the view of a noble monument of anci<lb/>
                -ent grandeur has been &#8212; yet this same pile<lb/>
                of stones we had never before observed. When<lb/>
                we had descended considerably the fields of Hartsop<lb/>
                below Brotherswater were first seen, like a Lake <lb/>
                coloured by the reflection of yellow clouds, I <lb/>
                </p>
               
            <p><span change="brown">[end page 2]</span></p>
            
                <p>mistook them for the water; but soon after we saw<lb/>
                the Lake itself gleaming faintly with a grey steely<lb/>
                brightness; then appeared the brown oaks, and the<lb/>
                birches of splendid colour, and, when we came still<lb/>
                nearer to the valley, the cottages under their tufts<lb/>
                of trees and the old Hall of Hartsop with its long<lb/>
                irregular front and elegant chimneys. We had<lb/>
                eaten our dinner under the shelter of a Sheep-fold<lb/>
                by the bridge at the foot of the mountain,<lb/>
                having tethered the pony at the entrance, where<lb/>
                it stood without one impatient beating of a<lb/>
                foot &#8212; I could not but love it for its meekness,<lb/>
                and indeed I thought we were selfish to enjoy<lb/>
                our meal so heartily while his poor jaws were<lb/>
                tethered by the curb bridle. We reached M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><lb/>
                Luff&#8217;s about two hours before tea-time.<lb/>
                </p>

                when it became fair, and W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> and I walked to <lb/>
                Blowick. Luff joined us by the way. The wind<lb/>
                was strong and drove the clouds forward along<lb/>
                the side of the hill above our heads; four or<lb/>
                five goats were bounding among the rocks;<lb/>
                the sheep moved about more quietly or cowered<lb/>
                in their sheltering places &#8212; the two storm-stiffened<lb/>

                <p>black Yew Trees on the crag above Luff&#8217;s house were<lb/>
                striking objects, close under or seen through the <lb/>
                flying mists. I do not know what to say of<lb/>
                Blowick; for to attempt to <hi rend="underline">describe</hi> the place<lb/>
                would be absurd when you for whom I write have<lb/>
                been there, or may go thither as soon as you like.<lb/>
                When we stood upon the naked Crag upon the Com<lb/>
                -mon overlooking its <hi rend="sup">x</hi> woods &amp; bush-besprinkled
                fields,<lb/>
                the Lake, Clouds, and Mists were all in motion to<lb/>
                the sound of sweeping winds &#8212; the Church and Cottages<lb/>
                of Patterdale scarcely visible from the brightness<lb/>
                of the thin mist. Looking backwards toward<lb/>
                the Foot of the Water the scene less visionary &#8212;<lb/>
                Place Fell steady and bold as a lion &#8212; the whole<lb/>
                Lake driving down like a great river &#8212; waves <lb/>
                dancing round the small Islands. We walked<lb/>
                to the house; the Owner was salving sheep in<lb/>
                the barn &#8212; an appearance of poverty and decay<lb/>
                every where; &#8212; he asked us if we wanted to pur :<lb/>
                -chase the estate. We could not but stop fre -<lb/>
                -quently both in going and returning to look at<lb/>
                the exquisite beauty of the woods opposite. The<lb/>
                general colour of the trees was dark brown,<lb/>
                rather that of ripe hazel nuts; but towards<lb/>

                <p>the water there were yet beds of green, and, in some of<lb/>
                the hollow places in the highest part of the woods, the<lb/>
                trees were of a yellow colour, and, through the glittering<lb/>
                light, they looked like masses of clouds as you see<lb/>
                them gathered together in the West, and tinged with<lb/>
                the golden light of the sun. After dinner we walk<lb/>
                -ed with M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Luff up the Vale; I had never had an<lb/>
                idea of the extent and width of it in passing thro&#8217;<lb/>
                along the road on the other side. We walked along<lb/>
                the path which leads from house to house; two or<lb/>
                three times it took us through some of those copses<lb/>
                or groves that cover every little hillock in the mid<lb/>
                -dle of the lower part of the Vale, making an<lb/>
                intricate and beautiful intermixture of lawn and<lb/>
                woodland. We left William to prolong his walk; and when<lb/>
                he came into the house he told us that he had pitched<lb/>
                upon the spot where he should like to build a house<lb/>
                better than in any other he had <hi rend="sup">ever</hi> yet seen. M<hi
                    rend="sup">rs</hi> Luff went<lb/>
                with him by moonlight to view it. The Vale looked<lb/>

                when the moon had climbed up to the middle of the<lb/>

                the eastern hills were a black shade, those on the<lb/>
                opposite side were almost as bright as snow.<lb/>
                M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Luff’s large white Dog lay in the moonshine<lb/>

                <p>Friday Nov 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi><lb/>
                <hi rend="indent7">It rained till near ten o&#8217;clock, but<lb/></hi>
                a little after that time, it being likely for a tolera-<lb/>
                -bly fine day, we packed up bread and cold meat, and,<lb/>
                with Luff’s servant to help to row, set forward in the<lb/>
                Boat. As we proceeded the day grew finer &#8212; clouds<lb/>
                and sunny gleams on the mountains. In a grand<lb/>
                Bay under Place Fell we saw three Fishermen with<lb/>
                a Boat dragging a net, and rowed up to them.<lb/>
                They had just brought the net ashore, and hun<lb/>
                -dreds of fish were leaping in their prison. They<lb/>
                were all of one kind, what are called Skellies.<lb/>
                After we had left them the Fishermen continu<lb/>
                -ed their work, a picturesque group under the<lb/>
                lofty and bare crags; the whole scene was very<lb/>
                grand, a raven croaking on the mountain above<lb/>
                our heads. &#8212; Landed at Sanwick &#8212; the man took<lb/>
                the Boat home, and we pursued our journey<lb/>
                towards the village along a beautiful summer<lb/>
                path, at first through a copse by the Lake<lb/>
                side, then through green fields &#8212; the Village and<lb/>
                Brook very pretty, shut out from mountains and<lb/>
                Lakes &#8212; it reminded me of Somersetshire &#8212; Passed<lb/>
                by Harry Hebson&#8217;s house &#8212; I longed to go in for<lb/>
                the sake of former times. W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> went up one side<lb/></p>

                <p>of the Vale and we the other, and he joined us<lb/>
                after having crossed the one-arched bridge above the<lb/>
                Church &#8212; a beautiful view of the church with its <lb/>
                &#8220;bare ring of mossy wall&#8221; and single Yew Tree. At<lb/>
                the last house in the Vale we were kindly<lb/>
                greeted by the Master, who was sitting at the door<lb/>
                salving sheep &#8212; he invited us to go in and see a <lb/>
                room lately built by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hazel for his accommo<lb/>
                -dation at the yearly chace of red Deer in his<lb/>
                Forests at the head of these Dales; the room is fit-<lb/>
                -ted up in the sportsman&#8217;s style, with a single cup-<lb/>
                -board for bottles and glasses &amp;c, some strong chairs, and<lb/>
                a large dining-table; and ornamented with the horns <lb/>
                of the stags caught at these Hunts for many years<lb/>
                back, with the length of the last race they ran<lb/>
                recorded under each. We ate our dinner here; the<lb/>
                good woman treated us with excellent butter and new<lb/>
                oat bread, and, after drinking some of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hazel&#8217;s<lb/>
                strong Ale we were well prepared to face the<lb/>
                mountain, which we began to climb almost immedi-<lb/>
                -ately. Martindale divides itself into two dales<lb/>
                at the head. In one of these (that to the left)<lb/>
                there is no house to be seen, nor any building<lb/>
                but a cattle shed on the side of a hill which<lb/>
                is sprinkled over with wood, evidently the remains <lb/>
                of a Forest, formerly a very extensive one. At<lb/>
                the bottom of the other Valley is the house of which<lb/>
                I have spoken, and beyond the enclosures of this man’s<lb/></p>
            
               <p><span change="brown">[end page 7]</span></p>
            
                <p>Farm there are no other. A few old trees remain, relicks<lb/>
                of the Forest, a little stream passes in serpentine wind-<lb/>
                -ings through the uncultivated valley, where many Cattle<lb/>
                were feeding &#8212; the Cattle of this country are generally<lb/>
                white or light-coloured; but those were mostly dark<lb/>
                brown or black, which made the scene resemble ma-<lb/>
                -ny parts of Scotland. When we sate on the hill-<lb/>
                -side, though we were well contented with the quiet<lb/>
                every-day sounds, the lowing of cattle, bleating of<lb/>
                sheep, and the very gentle murmuring of the valley<lb/>
                stream, yet we could not but think what a grand<lb/>
                effect the sound of the Bugle Horn would have<lb/>
                among these mountains. It is still heard once<lb/>
                a year at the Chace I have spoken of, a day<lb/>
                of festivity for all the Inhabitants of this Dis-<lb/>
                trict except the poor Deer, the most ancient <lb/>
                of them all. The ascent, even to the top of the<lb/>
                mountain, is very easy. When we had accomplish-<lb/>
                -ed it we had some exceedingly fine mountain<lb/>
                views, some of the mountains being resplendent<lb/>
                with sunshine, others partly hidden by clouds. <lb/>
                Ulswater was of a dazzling brightness bordered by<lb/>
               black hills &#8212; the plain beyond Penrith smooth<lb/>
                and bright, (or rather <hi rend="underline">gleamy</hi>) as the sea or sea<lb/>
                Sands. Looked into Boar Dale above Sanwick,<lb/>
                deep and bare, a stream winding down it. After<lb/>
                having walked a considerable way on the tops of<lb/>
                the hills, came in view of Glenriddin and the <lb/></p>
            
               <p><span change="brown">[end page 8]</span></p>
            
                <p>mountains above Grisdale. Luff then took us aside,<lb/>
                before we had begun to descend, to a small Ruin<lb/>
                which was formerly a Chapel or place of worship<lb/>
                where the Inhabitants of Martindale and Patterdale<lb/>
                were accustomed to meet on Sabbath days. There<lb/>
                are now no traces by which you could discover<lb/>
                that the Building had been different from a com-<lb/>
                -mon sheep-fold; the loose stones, and the few<lb/>
                which yet remain piled up are the same as<lb/>
                those which lie about on the mountain; but<lb/>
                the shape of the building, being oblong, is not<lb/>
                that of a common sheep-fold, and it stands East<lb/>
                and West. Whether it was ever consecrated ground<lb/>
                or not I know not; but the place may be kept<lb/>
                holy in the memory of some now living in Pat-<lb/>
                -terdale; for it was the means of preserving the <lb/>
                life of a poor old man last summer who, hav-<lb/>
                -ing gone up the mountain to gather peats, had<lb/>
                been overtaken by a storm, and could not<lb/>
                find his way down again. He happened to be<lb/>
                near the remains of the old Chapel, and, in <lb/>
                a corner of it, he contrived, by laying turf and<lb/>
                ling and stones from one wall to the other, to<lb/>
                make a shelter from the wind, and there he<lb/>
                lay all night. The Woman who had sent him<lb/>
                on his errand began to grow uneasy towards<lb/></p>
            
                <p><span change="brown">[end page 9]</span></p>
            
                <p>night and the neighbours went out to seek him.<lb/>
                At that time the old Man had housed himself in<lb/>
                his nest, and he heard the voices of the men; but<lb/>
                could not make <hi rend="underline">them</hi> hear, the wind being so loud,<lb/>
                and he was afraid to leave the spot least he <lb/>
                should not ^be able to find it again, so he remained<lb/> <!--Should we put an add rend="sup" for this carrot thing?-->
                there all night, and they returned to their homes<lb/>
                giving him up for lost; but the next morning the<lb/>
                same persons discovered him huddled up in the she[l]tered<lb/>
                work. He was, at first, stupefied and unable to move;<lb/>
                but after he had eaten and drunk, and recollected<lb/>
                himself a little, he walked down the mountain, and did<lb/>
                not afterwards seem to have suffered. As we descend,<lb/>
                the Vale of Patterdale appears very simple and grand<lb/>
                with its two heads, Deep-dale, and Brotherswater or Hart<lb/>
                Hartsop. It is remarkable that two pairs of Bro-<lb/>
                -thers should have been drowned in that Lake. There<lb/>
                is a tradition, at least, that it took its name<lb/>
                from two who were drowned there many years<lb/>
                ago, and it is a fact that two others did meet<lb/>
                that melancholy fate about twenty years since. <lb/>
                It was upon a New-year&#8217;s Day. Their Mother had<lb/>
                sent them to thresh some corn, and they, probably<lb/>
                thinking it hard to be so tasked when all others<lb/>
                were keeping holiday, stole out to slide upon<lb/>
                the ice and were both drowned. A Neighbour who<lb/></p>
            
                <p><span change="brown">[end page 10]</span></p>
            
                <p>who had seen them fall through the ice, though not near<lb/>
                enough to be <hi rend="underline">certain</hi>, guessed who they were, and went<lb/>
                to the mother to enquire after her sons. She replied<lb/>
                that they were in the Barn threshing, “Nay,” said<lb/>
                the Man, they are not there, I am sure, and it<lb/>
                is not likely today.” The Woman went with<lb/>
                him to the Barn and the Boys were gone:<lb/>
                he was then confirmed, and told her that he believ-<lb/>
                -ed that they were drowned. It is said that they<lb/>
                were found locked in each other’s arms. I was<lb/>
                exceedingly tired when we reached home, owing<lb/>
                to the steepness and roughness of the peat track<lb/>
                by which we descended. I lay down on the<lb/>
                Sofa in M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Luff’s parlour and was asleep<lb/>
                in three minutes - - - - -. A fine moonlight<lb/>
                night – a thick fog in the middle of the<lb/>
                Vale, which disheartened William about the<lb/>
                situation of his house. Supped on some of the<lb/>
                Fish caught by the Fishermen at the foot<lb/>
                of Place Fell. We thought them excellent.<lb/></p>
            
                <p>Saturday Novr 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi><lb/>
                <hi rend="indent8">A beautiful morning. When<lb/></hi>
                we were at breakfast we heard suddenly the tidings<lb/>
                of Lord Nelson’s death, and the Victory of Trafal-<lb/>
                -gar. Went to the Inn to make further inquiries – <lb/>
                I was shocked to hear that there had been great<lb/></p>

                <p>rejoicings at Penrith. Returned by William’s rock and<lb/>
                grove, and were so much pleased with the spot that<lb/>
                W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> determined to buy it if possible, therefore we
                    pre-<lb/>
                pared to set off to Park House that W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> might ap-<lb/>
                -ply to Thomas Wilkinson to negotiate for him<lb/>
                with the owner. We went down that side of the <lb/>
                Lake opposite to Stybarrow Crag: I dismounted,<lb/>
                and we sate some time under the same rock as<lb/>
                before, above Blowick. Owing to the brightness of<lb/>
                the sunshine the Church and other buildings were<lb/>
                even more concealed from us than by the mists<lb/>
                the other day. It had been a sharp frost in the <lb/>
                night, and the grass and trees were yet wet.<lb/>
                We observed the lemon-coloured leaves of the birches<lb/>
                in the wood below, as the wind turned them to the <lb/>
                sun, sparkle, or rather <hi rend="underline">flash</hi>, like diamonds. The <lb/>
                day continued unclouded to the end. We had a de-<lb/>
                -lightful ride and walk, for it was both to both of <lb/>
                us. We led the horse under Place Fell, &amp;, though<lb/>
                I mostly rode when the way was good, William<lb/>
                sometimes mounted to rest himself. Called at<lb/>
                Eusemere. Went by Bower Bank, intending to<lb/>
                ford the Emont at the Mill; but the pony would<lb/>
                not carry us both, so, after many attempts, I rode<lb/>
                over myself and a Girl followed me on another<lb/>
                horse to take back the pony to William. Very cold <lb/></p>

                <p>before we reached Park House. Derwent ran to meet<lb/>
                us. Sate in the kitchen till the parlour fire was<lb/>
                lighted and then <hi rend="underline">enjoyed </hi>a comfortable
                    dish of tea.<lb/>
                After tea William went to Thomas Wilkinson’s and<lb/>
                to Brougham.<lb/></p>
            
                <p>Monday, November 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi><lb/>
                <hi rend="indent10">The morning being fine, we re-<lb/></hi>
                -solved to go to Lowther, and accordingly Sara H.<lb/>
                mounted her Brother’s horse, I the pony, and<lb/>
                W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> and Miss Green set out on foot; but she<lb/>
                had not walked long before she took a seat behind<lb/>
                Sara. Crossed the Ford at Yanworth --- Found Tho-<lb/>
                -mas Wilkinson at work in one of his fields;<lb/>
                he chearfully laid down the spade and walked<lb/>
                by our side with William. We left our horses at <lb/>
                the Mill below Brougham, and walked through<lb/>
                the woods till we came to the Quarry, where the<lb/>
                road ends, the very place which has been the<lb/>
                Boundary of some of the happiest of the walks<lb/>
                of my youth. The sun did not shine when we were<lb/>
                there; and it was mid-day, therefore if it had shone,<lb/>
                the light could not have been the same; yet so<lb/>
                vividly did I call to mind those walks that<lb/>
                when I was in the wood I almost seemed to see<lb/>
                the same rich light of evening upon the trees<lb/>
                which I had seen in those happy hours. My heart <lb/></p>

                <p>was full; and I could not but grieve that any stran-<lb/>
                -gers were with us. At this time the Path was scarce<lb/>
                -ly traceable by the eye, all the ground being covered <lb/>
                with withered leaves, which I was very sorry for, W<hi rend="sup">m</hi><lb/>
                having spoken of the beauty of it with so much de<lb/>
                -light after he had been at Lowther in the summer.<lb/>
                Scrambled along under the Quarry; then came to T.<lb/>
                Wilkinson’s new path. We spent three delightful <lb/>
                hours by the River side and in the woods. Called at<lb/>
                Richard Bowman’s. We had a pleasant ride home;<lb/>
                Sara and I stopped at Red Hills while William<lb/>
                went over the Ford to T. Wilkinson’s. The House<lb/>
                untidy and uncomfortable – a little Girl never<lb/>
                ceased rocking the Baby in the cradle. We asked <lb/>
                if it would not sleep without rocking, and the<lb/>
                Mother said “No, for she was used to it” – Reached<lb/>
                Park House at ten o’clock – Joanna had waited<lb/>
                dinner and tea for us.<lb/></p>
            
                <p>Tuesday, November 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi><lb/>
                <hi rend="indent9">A very wet morning – no </hi><lb/>
                hope of being able to return home. W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> read in<lb/>
                a Book lent him by Thomas Wilkinson. I<lb/>
                read Castle Rackrent. The day cleared at<lb/>
                one o’clock and after dinner, at a little before<lb/>
                three we set forward. The pony was bogged in <lb/>
                Tom’s field &amp; I was obliged to dismount – Went <lb/>
                over Soulby Fell. Before we reached Ulswater the <lb/></p>

                <p>sun shone, and only a few scattered clouds remained<lb/>
                on the hills except at the tops of the very highest –<lb/>
                the Lake perfectly calm – We had a delightful jour-<lb/>
                -ney. At the beginning of the first Park William<lb/>
                got upon the pony, and, betwixt a walk and a<lb/>
                run, I kept pace with him while he trotted to the<lb/>
                next gate; then I mounted again. We were joined <lb/>
                by two Travellers; like ourselves, with one white horse<lb/>
                between them. We went on in company till we<lb/>
                came near to Patterdale, trotting most of the<lb/>
                time. The Trees in Gowborough Park were very beau-<lb/>
                -tiful, the hawthorns leafless – their round heads cover-<lb/>
                -ed with rich red berries, and adorned with arches of<lb/>
                green brambles, and eglantine hung with glossy hips<lb/>
                – Many birches yet tricked out in full foliage of<lb/>
                bright yellow – Oaks brown or leafless – the smooth<lb/>
                branches of the ashes bare – most of the alders green<lb/>
                as in spring. I think I have more pleasure in look-<lb/>
                -ing at deer than any other animals, perhaps chief-<lb/>
                -ly from their living in a more natural state. At<lb/>
                the end of Gowborough Park, A large Troop of them<lb/>
                were moving slowly, or standing still, among the fern.<lb/>
                I was grieved when our companions startled them with <lb/>
                a whistle, disturbing a beautiful image of grave<lb/>
                simplicity and thoughtful enjoyment; for I could<lb/>
                have fancied that even they were partaking with<lb/>
                me a sensation of the solemnity of the closing day. <lb/></p>

                <p>The sun had been set some time, though we could only<lb/>
                just perceive that the daylight was partly gone, and<lb/>
                the Lake was more brilliant than before. I dismount-<lb/>
                -ed again at Stybarrow Crag, and William rode till<lb/>
                we came almost to Glenriddin. Found the Luffs at <lb/>
                tea in the kitchen. After tea set out again; Luff<lb/>
                accompanied me on foot and William continued to<lb/>
                ride till we came to the foot of Brothers-water. <lb/>
                – A delightful evening – the Seven Stars close to<lb/>
                the hill tops in Patterdale – all the stars seemed<lb/>
                brighter than usual. The steeps were reflected in Bro-<lb/>
                -thers-water, and above the Lake appeared like enormous black<lb/>
                perpendicular walls. The torrents of Kirkstone had been<lb/>
                swoln by the rains, and filled the mountain Pass<lb/>
                with their roaring, which added greatly to the solem-<lb/>
                -nity of our walk – the stars in succession took their<lb/>
                stations on the mountain tops. Behind us, when we<lb/>
                had climbed very high we saw one light in the Vale<lb/>
                at a great distance, like a large star, a solitary<lb/>
                one, in the gloomy region – all the cheerfulness of<lb/>
                the scene was in the sky above us. Found Mary &amp;<lb/>
                the children in bed – no fire – luckily William was<lb/>
                warm with walking, and I not cold; having wrap-<lb/>
                -ped myself up most carefully, &amp; the night being mild.<lb/>
