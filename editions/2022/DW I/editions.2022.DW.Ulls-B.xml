                Wordsworth’s hand that seems to have been made for Lady Margaret Beaumont sometime
                in late 1805 or early 1806. It is known as the <title level="a">Coleorton Manuscript</title> both in
                reference to the Beaumonts’ Leicestershire estate, Coleorton Hall, and its being
                part of the Coleorton Papers at the Morgan Library in New York City. The manuscript
                (catalog #MA 1581) bears a descriptive title, “a mountainous ramble by D Wordsworth
                sister to <hi rend="underline">the poet,</hi>” likely added by Lady Beaumont.

            <p>might detain us at Patterdale; but as the mists</p>
            <p>thickened our enjoyment encreased, and my hopes</p>
            <p>grew bolder; and when we were at the top of </p>
            <p>Kirkstone (though we could not see fifty yards</p>
            <p>before us) we were as happy Travellers as ever</p>
            <p>paced side by side on a holiday ramble. At</p>
            <p>such a time and in such a place every scat-</p>
            <p>-tered stone the size of one’s head becomes a com</p>
            <p>-panion: there is a fragment of an old wall at</p>
            <p>the top of Kirkstone, which, magnified yet ob</p>
            <p>-scured as it was by the mist, was scarcely less</p>
            <p>interesting to us when we cast our eyes upon it</p>
            <p>than the view of a noble monument of anci</p>
            <p>-ent grandeur has been – yet this same pile</p>
            <p>of stones we had never before observed. When</p>
            <p>we had descended considerably the fields of Hartsop</p>
            <p>below Brotherswater were first seen, like a Lake </p>
            <p>coloured by the reflection of yellow clouds, I </p>
            <p><hi rend="color(833C0B)">[end page 2]</hi></p>

            <p>mistook them for the water; but soon after we saw</p>
            <p>the Lake itself gleaming faintly with a grey steely</p>
            <p>brightness; then appeared the brown oaks, and the</p>
            <p>birches of splendid colour, and, when we came still</p>
            <p>nearer to the valley, the cottages under their tufts</p>
            <p>of trees and the old Hall of Hartsop with its long</p>
            <p>irregular front and elegant chimneys. We had</p>
            <p>eaten our dinner under the shelter of a Sheep-fold</p>
            <p>by the bridge at the foot of the mountain,</p>
            <p>having tethered the pony at the entrance, where</p>
            <p>it stood without one impatient beating of a</p>
            <p>foot – I could not but love it for its meekness,</p>
            <p>and indeed I thought we were selfish to enjoy</p>
            <p>our meal so heartily while his poor jaws were</p>
            <p>tethered by the curb bridle. We reached M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></p>
            <p>Luff’s about two hours before tea-time.</p>

            <p>Blowick. Luff joined us by the way. The wind</p>
            <p>was strong and drove the clouds forward along</p>
            <p>the side of the hill above our heads; four or</p>
            <p>five goats were bounding among the rocks;</p>
            <p>the sheep moved about more quietly or cowered</p>
            <p>in their sheltering places – the two storm-stiffened</p>

            <p><pb/></p>
            <p>black Yew Trees on the crag above Luff’s house were</p>
            <p>striking objects, close under or seen through the </p>
            <p>flying mists. I do not know what to say of</p>
            <p>Blowick; for to attempt to <hi rend="underline">describe</hi> the place</p>
            <p>would be absurd when you for whom I write have</p>
            <p>been there, or may go thither as soon as you like.</p>
            <p>When we stood upon the naked Crag upon the Com</p>
            <p>-mon overlooking its <hi rend="superscript">x</hi> woods &amp; bush-besprinkled
                fields,</p>
            <p>the Lake, Clouds, and Mists were all in motion to</p>
            <p>the sound of sweeping winds – the Church and Cottages</p>
            <p>of Patterdale scarcely visible from the brightness</p>
            <p>of the thin mist. Looking backwards toward</p>
            <p>the Foot of the Water the scene less visionary –</p>
            <p>Place Fell steady and bold as a lion – the whole</p>
            <p>Lake driving down like a great river – waves </p>
            <p>dancing round the small Islands. We walked</p>
            <p>to the house; the Owner was salving sheep in</p>
            <p>the barn – an appearance of poverty and decay</p>
            <p>every where; – he asked us if we wanted to pur :</p>

            <p>-quently both in going and returning to look at</p>
            <p>the exquisite beauty of the woods opposite. The</p>
            <p>general colour of the trees was dark brown,</p>
            <p>rather that of ripe hazel nuts; but towards</p>
            <p>x N.B. The fields <hi rend="superscript">&amp; woods</hi> belonging to the Farm of

            <p>the water there were yet beds of green, and, in some of</p>
            <p>the hollow places in the highest part of the woods, the</p>
            <p>trees were of a yellow colour, and, through the glittering</p>
            <p>light, they looked like masses of clouds as you see</p>
            <p>them gathered together in the West, and tinged with</p>
            <p>the golden light of the sun. After dinner we walk</p>
            <p>-ed with M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Luff up the Vale; I had never had an</p>
            <p>idea of the extent and width of it in passing thro’</p>
            <p>along the road on the other side. We walked along</p>
            <p>the path which leads from house to house; two or</p>
            <p>three times it took us through some of those copses</p>
            <p>or groves that cover every little hillock in the mid</p>
            <p>-dle of the lower part of the Vale, making an</p>
            <p>intricate and beautiful intermixture of lawn and</p>
            <p>woodland. We left William to prolong his walk; and when</p>
            <p>he came into the house he told us that he had pitched</p>
            <p>upon the spot where he should like to build a house</p>
            <p>better than in any other he had <hi rend="superscript">ever</hi> yet seen. M<hi
                    rend="superscript">rs</hi> Luff went</p>
            <p>with him by moonlight to view it. The Vale looked</p>

            <p>when the moon had climbed up to the middle of the</p>

            <p>the eastern hills were a black shade, those on the</p>

            <p>Friday Nov 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
            </p>
            <p> It rained till near ten o’clock, but</p>
            <p>a little after that time, it being likely for a tolera-</p>
            <p>-bly fine day, we packed up bread and cold meat, and,</p>
            <p>with Luff’s servant to help to row, set forward in the</p>
            <p>Boat. As we proceeded the day grew finer – clouds</p>
            <p>and sunny gleams on the mountains. In a grand</p>
            <p>Bay under Place Fell we saw three Fishermen with</p>
            <p>a Boat dragging a net, and rowed up to them.</p>
            <p>They had just brought the net ashore, and hun</p>
            <p>-dreds of fish were leaping in their prison. They</p>
            <p>were all of one kind, what are called Skellies.</p>
            <p>After we had left them the Fishermen continu</p>
            <p>-ed their work, a picturesque group under the</p>
            <p>lofty and bare crags; the whole scene was very</p>
            <p>grand, a raven croaking on the mountain above</p>
            <p>our heads. – Landed at Sanwick – the man took</p>
            <p>the Boat home, and we pursued our journey</p>
            <p>towards the village along a beautiful summer</p>
            <p>path, at first through a copse by the Lake</p>
            <p>side, then through green fields – the Village and</p>
            <p>Brook very pretty, shut out from mountains and</p>
            <p>Lakes – it reminded me of Somersetshire – Passed</p>
            <p>by Harry Hebson’s house – I longed to go in for</p>
            <p>the sake of former times. W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi> went up one side</p>

            <p>of the Vale and we the other, and he joined us</p>
            <p>after having crossed the one-arched bridge above the</p>
            <p>Church – a beautiful view of the church with its </p>
            <p>“bare ring of mossy wall” and single Yew Tree. At</p>
            <p>the last house in the Vale we were kindly</p>
            <p>greeted by the Master, who was sitting at the door</p>
            <p>salving sheep – he invited us to go in and see a </p>
            <p>room lately built by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hazel for his accommo</p>
            <p>-dation at the yearly chace of red Deer in his</p>
            <p>Forests at the head of these Dales; the room is fit-</p>
            <p>-ted up in the sportsman’s style, with a single cup-</p>
            <p>-board for bottles and glasses &amp;c, some strong chairs, and</p>
            <p>a large dining-table; and ornamented with the horns </p>
            <p>of the stags caught at these Hunts for many years</p>
            <p>back, with the length of the last race they ran</p>
            <p>recorded under each. We ate our dinner here; the</p>
            <p>good woman treated us with excellent butter and new</p>
            <p>oat bread, and, after drinking some of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hazel’s</p>
            <p>strong Ale we were well prepared to face the</p>
            <p>mountain, which we began to climb almost immedi-</p>
            <p>-ately. Martindale divides itself into two dales</p>
            <p>at the head. In one of these (that to the left)</p>
            <p>there is no house to be seen, nor any building</p>
            <p>but a cattle shed on the side of a hill which</p>
            <p>is sprinkled over with wood, evidently the remains </p>
            <p>of a Forest, formerly a very extensive one. At</p>
            <p>the bottom of the other Valley is the house of which</p>
            <p>I have spoken, and beyond the enclosures of this man’s</p>
            <p><hi rend="color(833C0B)">[end page 7]</hi></p>
            <p><pb/></p>
            <p>Farm there are no other. A few old trees remain, relicks</p>
            <p>of the Forest, a little stream passes in serpentine wind-</p>
            <p>-ings through the uncultivated valley, where many Cattle</p>
            <p>were feeding – the Cattle of this country are generally</p>
            <p>white or light-coloured; but those were mostly dark</p>
            <p>brown or black, which made the scene resemble ma-</p>
            <p>-ny parts of Scotland. When we sate on the hill-</p>
            <p>-side, though we were well contented with the quiet</p>
            <p>every-day sounds, the lowing of cattle, bleating of</p>
            <p>sheep, and the very gentle murmuring of the valley</p>
            <p>stream, yet we could not but think what a grand</p>
            <p>effect the sound of the Bugle Horn would have</p>
            <p>among these mountains. It is still heard once</p>
            <p>a year at the Chace I have spoken of, a day</p>
            <p>of festivity for all the Inhabitants of this Dis-</p>
            <p>trict except the poor Deer, the most ancient </p>
            <p>of them all. The ascent, even to the top of the</p>
            <p>mountain, is very easy. When we had accomplish-</p>
            <p>-ed it we had some exceedingly fine mountain</p>
            <p>views, some of the mountains being resplendent</p>
            <p>with sunshine, others partly hidden by clouds. </p>
            <p>Ulswater was of a dazzling brightness bordered by</p>
            <p>black hills – the plain beyond Penrith smooth</p>
            <p>and bright, (or rather <hi rend="underline">gleamy</hi>) as the sea or sea</p>
            <p>Sands. Looked into Boar Dale above Sanwick,</p>
            <p>deep and bare, a stream winding down it. After</p>
            <p>having walked a considerable way on the tops of</p>
            <p>the hills, came in view of Glenriddin and the </p>
            <p><hi rend="color(833C0B)">[end page 8]</hi></p>
            <p><pb/></p>
            <p>mountains above Grisdale. Luff then took us aside,</p>
            <p>before we had begun to descend, to a small Ruin</p>
            <p>which was formerly a Chapel or place of worship</p>
            <p>where the Inhabitants of Martindale and Patterdale</p>
            <p>were accustomed to meet on Sabbath days. There</p>
            <p>are now no traces by which you could discover</p>
            <p>that the Building had been different from a com-</p>
            <p>-mon sheep-fold; the loose stones, and the few</p>
            <p>which yet remain piled up are the same as</p>
            <p>those which lie about on the mountain; but</p>
            <p>the shape of the building, being oblong, is not</p>
            <p>that of a common sheep-fold, and it stands East</p>
            <p>and West. Whether it was ever consecrated ground</p>
            <p>or not I know not; but the place may be kept</p>
            <p>holy in the memory of some now living in Pat-</p>
            <p>-terdale; for it was the means of preserving the </p>
            <p>life of a poor old man last summer who, hav-</p>
            <p>-ing gone up the mountain to gather peats, had</p>
            <p>been overtaken by a storm, and could not</p>
            <p>find his way down again. He happened to be</p>
            <p>near the remains of the old Chapel, and, in </p>
            <p>a corner of it, he contrived, by laying turf and</p>
            <p>ling and stones from one wall to the other, to</p>
            <p>make a shelter from the wind, and there he</p>
            <p>lay all night. The Woman who had sent him</p>
            <p>on his errand began to grow uneasy towards</p>
            <p><hi rend="color(833C0B)">[end page 9]</hi></p>
            <p><pb/></p>
            <p>night and the neighbours went out to seek him.</p>
            <p>At that time the old Man had housed himself in</p>
            <p>his nest, and he heard the voices of the men; but</p>
            <p>could not make <hi rend="underline">them</hi> hear, the wind being so loud,</p>
            <p>and he was afraid to leave the spot least he </p>
            <p>should not ^be able to find it again, so he remained</p>
            <p>there all night, and they returned to their homes</p>
            <p>giving him up for lost; but the next morning the</p>
            <p>same persons discovered him huddled up in the she[l]tered</p>
            <p>work. He was, at first, stupefied and unable to move;</p>
            <p>but after he had eaten and drunk, and recollected</p>
            <p>himself a little, he walked down the mountain, and did</p>
            <p>not afterwards seem to have suffered. As we descend,</p>
            <p>the Vale of Patterdale appears very simple and grand</p>
            <p>with its two heads, Deep-dale, and Brotherswater or Hart</p>
            <p>Hartsop. It is remarkable that two pairs of Bro-</p>
            <p>-thers should have been drowned in that Lake. There</p>
            <p>is a tradition, at least, that it took its name</p>
            <p>from two who were drowned there many years</p>
            <p>ago, and it is a fact that two others did meet</p>
            <p>that melancholy fate about twenty years since. </p>
            <p>It was upon a New-year’s Day. Their Mother had</p>
            <p>sent them to thresh some corn, and they, probably</p>
            <p>thinking it hard to be so tasked when all others</p>
            <p>were keeping holiday, stole out to slide upon</p>
            <p>the ice and were both drowned. A Neighbour who</p>
            <p><hi rend="color(833C0B)">[end page 10]</hi></p>
            <p><pb/></p>
            <p>who had seen them fall through the ice, though not near</p>
            <p>enough to be <hi rend="underline">certain</hi>, guessed who they were, and went</p>
            <p>to the mother to enquire after her sons. She replied</p>
            <p>that they were in the Barn threshing, “Nay,” said</p>
            <p>the Man, they are not there, I am sure, and it</p>
            <p>is not likely today.” The Woman went with</p>
            <p>him to the Barn and the Boys were gone:</p>
            <p>he was then confirmed, and told her that he believ-</p>
            <p>-ed that they were drowned. It is said that they</p>
            <p>were found locked in each other’s arms. I was</p>
            <p>exceedingly tired when we reached home, owing</p>
            <p>to the steepness and roughness of the peat track</p>
            <p>by which we descended. I lay down on the</p>
            <p>Sofa in M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Luff’s parlour and was asleep</p>
            <p>in three minutes - - - - -. A fine moonlight</p>
            <p>night – a thick fog in the middle of the</p>
            <p>Vale, which disheartened William about the</p>
            <p>situation of his house. Supped on some of the</p>
            <p>Fish caught by the Fishermen at the foot</p>
            <p>of Place Fell. We thought them excellent.</p>
            <p>Saturday Novr 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
            </p>
            <p> A beautiful morning. When</p>
            <p>we were at breakfast we heard suddenly the tidings</p>
            <p>of Lord Nelson’s death, and the Victory of Trafal-</p>
            <p>-gar. Went to the Inn to make further inquiries – </p>
            <p>I was shocked to hear that there had been great</p>
            <p><hi rend="color(833C0B)">[end page 11]</hi></p>
            <p><pb/></p>
            <p>rejoicings at Penrith. Returned by William’s rock and</p>
            <p>grove, and were so much pleased with the spot that</p>
            <p>W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi> determined to buy it if possible, therefore we
                pre-</p>
            <p>pared to set off to Park House that W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi> might ap-</p>
            <p>-ply to Thomas Wilkinson to negotiate for him</p>
            <p>with the owner. We went down that side of the </p>
            <p>Lake opposite to Stybarrow Crag: I dismounted,</p>
            <p>and we sate some time under the same rock as</p>
            <p>before, above Blowick. Owing to the brightness of</p>
            <p>the sunshine the Church and other buildings were</p>
            <p>even more concealed from us than by the mists</p>
            <p>the other day. It had been a sharp frost in the </p>
            <p>night, and the grass and trees were yet wet.</p>
            <p>We observed the lemon-coloured leaves of the birches</p>
            <p>in the wood below, as the wind turned them to the </p>
            <p>sun, sparkle, or rather <hi rend="underline">flash</hi>, like diamonds. The </p>
            <p>day continued unclouded to the end. We had a de-</p>
            <p>-lightful ride and walk, for it was both to both of </p>
            <p>us. We led the horse under Place Fell, &amp;, though</p>
            <p>I mostly rode when the way was good, William</p>
            <p>sometimes mounted to rest himself. Called at</p>
            <p>Eusemere. Went by Bower Bank, intending to</p>
            <p>ford the Emont at the Mill; but the pony would</p>
            <p>not carry us both, so, after many attempts, I rode</p>
            <p>over myself and a Girl followed me on another</p>
            <p>horse to take back the pony to William. Very cold </p>
            <p><hi rend="color(833C0B)">[end page 12]</hi></p>
            <p><pb/></p>
            <p>before we reached Park House. Derwent ran to meet</p>
            <p>us. Sate in the kitchen till the parlour fire was</p>
            <p>lighted and then <hi rend="underline" xml:space="preserve">enjoyed </hi>a comfortable
                dish of tea.</p>
            <p>After tea William went to Thomas Wilkinson’s and</p>
            <p>to Brougham.</p>
            <p>Monday, November 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
            </p>
            <p> The morning being fine, we re-</p>
            <p>-solved to go to Lowther, and accordingly Sara H.</p>
            <p>mounted her Brother’s horse, I the pony, and</p>
            <p>W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi> and Miss Green set out on foot; but she</p>
            <p>had not walked long before she took a seat behind</p>
            <p>Sara. Crossed the Ford at Yanworth --- Found Tho-</p>
            <p>-mas Wilkinson at work in one of his fields;</p>
            <p>he chearfully laid down the spade and walked</p>
            <p>by our side with William. We left our horses at </p>
            <p>the Mill below Brougham, and walked through</p>
            <p>the woods till we came to the Quarry, where the</p>
            <p>road ends, the very place which has been the</p>
            <p>Boundary of some of the happiest of the walks</p>
            <p>of my youth. The sun did not shine when we were</p>
            <p>there; and it was mid-day, therefore if it had shone,</p>
            <p>the light could not have been the same; yet so</p>
            <p>vividly did I call to mind those walks that</p>
            <p>when I was in the wood I almost seemed to see</p>
            <p>the same rich light of evening upon the trees</p>
            <p>which I had seen in those happy hours. My heart </p>
            <p><hi rend="color(833C0B)">[end page 13]</hi></p>
            <p><pb/></p>
            <p>was full; and I could not but grieve that any stran-</p>
            <p>-gers were with us. At this time the Path was scarce</p>
            <p>-ly traceable by the eye, all the ground being covered </p>
            <p>with withered leaves, which I was very sorry for, W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi></p>
            <p>having spoken of the beauty of it with so much de</p>
            <p>-light after he had been at Lowther in the summer.</p>
            <p>Scrambled along under the Quarry; then came to T.</p>
            <p>Wilkinson’s new path. We spent three delightful </p>
            <p>hours by the River side and in the woods. Called at</p>
            <p>Richard Bowman’s. We had a pleasant ride home;</p>
            <p>Sara and I stopped at Red Hills while William</p>
            <p>went over the Ford to T. Wilkinson’s. The House</p>
            <p>untidy and uncomfortable – a little Girl never</p>
            <p>ceased rocking the Baby in the cradle. We asked </p>
            <p>if it would not sleep without rocking, and the</p>
            <p>Mother said “No, for she was used to it” – Reached</p>
            <p>Park House at ten o’clock – Joanna had waited</p>
            <p>dinner and tea for us.</p>
            <p>Tuesday, November 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
            </p>
            <p> A very wet morning – no </p>
            <p>hope of being able to return home. W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi> read in</p>
            <p>a Book lent him by Thomas Wilkinson. I</p>
            <p>read Castle Rackrent. The day cleared at</p>
            <p>one o’clock and after dinner, at a little before</p>
            <p>three we set forward. The pony was bogged in </p>
            <p>Tom’s field &amp; I was obliged to dismount – Went </p>
            <p>over Soulby Fell. Before we reached Ulswater the </p>
            <p><hi rend="color(833C0B)">[end page 14]</hi></p>
            <p><pb/></p>
            <p>sun shone, and only a few scattered clouds remained</p>
            <p>on the hills except at the tops of the very highest –</p>
            <p>the Lake perfectly calm – We had a delightful jour-</p>
            <p>-ney. At the beginning of the first Park William</p>
            <p>got upon the pony, and, betwixt a walk and a</p>
            <p>run, I kept pace with him while he trotted to the</p>
            <p>next gate; then I mounted again. We were joined </p>
            <p>by two Travellers; like ourselves, with one white horse</p>
            <p>between them. We went on in company till we</p>
            <p>came near to Patterdale, trotting most of the</p>
            <p>time. The Trees in Gowborough Park were very beau-</p>
            <p>-tiful, the hawthorns leafless – their round heads cover-</p>
            <p>-ed with rich red berries, and adorned with arches of</p>
            <p>green brambles, and eglantine hung with glossy hips</p>
            <p>– Many birches yet tricked out in full foliage of</p>
            <p>bright yellow – Oaks brown or leafless – the smooth</p>
            <p>branches of the ashes bare – most of the alders green</p>
            <p>as in spring. I think I have more pleasure in look-</p>
            <p>-ing at deer than any other animals, perhaps chief-</p>
            <p>-ly from their living in a more natural state. At</p>
            <p>the end of Gowborough Park, A large Troop of them</p>
            <p>were moving slowly, or standing still, among the fern.</p>
            <p>I was grieved when our companions startled them with </p>
            <p>a whistle, disturbing a beautiful image of grave</p>
            <p>simplicity and thoughtful enjoyment; for I could</p>
            <p>have fancied that even they were partaking with</p>
            <p>me a sensation of the solemnity of the closing day. </p>
            <p><hi rend="color(833C0B)">[end page 15]</hi></p>
            <p><pb/></p>
            <p>The sun had been set some time, though we could only</p>
            <p>just perceive that the daylight was partly gone, and</p>
            <p>the Lake was more brilliant than before. I dismount-</p>
            <p>-ed again at Stybarrow Crag, and William rode till</p>
            <p>we came almost to Glenriddin. Found the Luffs at </p>
            <p>tea in the kitchen. After tea set out again; Luff</p>
            <p>accompanied me on foot and William continued to</p>
            <p>ride till we came to the foot of Brothers-water. </p>
            <p>– A delightful evening – the Seven Stars close to</p>
            <p>the hill tops in Patterdale – all the stars seemed</p>
            <p>brighter than usual. The steeps were reflected in Bro-</p>
            <p>-thers-water, and above the Lake appeared like enormous black</p>
            <p>perpendicular walls. The torrents of Kirkstone had been</p>
            <p>swoln by the rains, and filled the mountain Pass</p>
            <p>with their roaring, which added greatly to the solem-</p>
            <p>-nity of our walk – the stars in succession took their</p>
            <p>stations on the mountain tops. Behind us, when we</p>
            <p>had climbed very high we saw one light in the Vale</p>
            <p>at a great distance, like a large star, a solitary</p>
            <p>one, in the gloomy region – all the cheerfulness of</p>
            <p>the scene was in the sky above us. Found Mary &amp;</p>
            <p>the children in bed – no fire – luckily William was</p>
            <p>warm with walking, and I not cold; having wrap-</p>
            <p>-ped myself up most carefully, &amp; the night being mild.</p>
