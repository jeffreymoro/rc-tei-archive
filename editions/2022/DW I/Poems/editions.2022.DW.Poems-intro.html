               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>While individual poems by Dorothy Wordsworth appeared in nineteenth-century collections
                     of her brother’s verse and twentieth-century teaching anthologies, the first comprehensive
                     presentation of her poems didn’t appear until 1987, when Susan Levin published them
                     as the appendix to her critical study <em>Dorothy Wordsworth and Romanticism</em>, an effort she later amplified with her important teaching edition, <em>Dorothy Wordsworth: A Longman Cultural Edition</em>, in 2009. These were milestone events, as Levin’s editorial work introduced the poems
                     to a broad academic audience and sparked a wave in which scholars such as Pamela Woof,
                     Rachel Feder, Lucy Newlyn, and Levin herself published thoughtful readings of Dorothy’s
                     verse. Since their first appearance in Levin’s monograph in 1987, several of Dorothy’s
                     poems have been anthologized, frequently appearing alongside selections from the Grasmere
                     journal notebooks. Two notable poems, 
                     “Thoughts on my Sickbed”
                      and 
                     “Grasmere—A Fragment,”
                      have also been included in recent editions of the <em>Norton Anthology of English Literature</em> and the <em>Broadview Anthology of British Literature</em>. Interestingly, the poems currently featured in teaching anthologies are not among
                     the five that were published in Dorothy’s lifetime. Even 
                     “Floating Island at Hawkshead,”
                      perhaps her best-known and finest poem, has been omitted. But the anthologized examples
                     are, arguably, those that may be considered her most “Wordsworthian,” insofar as they
                     elaborate themes also found in her brother’s poetry, such as the wonderment and healing
                     powers of nature and the imagination. Furthermore, they converse overtly with William’s
                     poems, offering useful comparisons for the classroom, though also implying through
                     the selection process that what matters most in Dorothy’s verse are these resonances.

                  <p>This electronic edition applies a different theory of inclusion, as we neither collect

                     manuscript sources, nor present a selection based on connections with William’s work

                     of Dorothy’s writing and grounded in a single manuscript: Dove Cottage Manuscript
                     (DCMS) 120, commonly referred to as the “commonplace book” (fig. 6.1). In this battered

                              FILS AINÉ, a shop in Boulogne-Sur-Mer that DW, WW, and MW visited in November 1820
                              near the end of their Continental tour. A detailed description of the notebook appears
                              in the section

                     </div> Dorothy collected most of the poems she wrote during her lifetime, often in multiple
                     versions. In most cases, she revised while collecting and copying, as is evident by
                     edits on the notebook’s pages, though some poems were copied fair. In total, the notebook’s
                     89 leaves contain 22 poems in 38 versions. Most of these poems were composed and entered
                     in the notebook between 1826 and 1832, though new entries appeared until 1840.

               <p>DCMS 120 also contains a considerable quantity of other material, copied from newspapers
                  and from other manuscripts as well as some print clippings. The miscellaneous nature
                  of the notebook’s contents may be seen in the <a class="link_ref" href="/editions/DW/editions.2022.DW.poems-contents">first table of contents created for this edition</a>. Included are all of Dorothy’s poems written to or about members of her domestic
                  circle, alongside recipes, epitaphs, and other snippets of poetry and prose. Interestingly,
                  Dorothy also incorporates fair copies of her poems handwritten by others, demonstrating
                  that her poetry (like the notebook itself) was shared with a group. She annotates
                  her own handwritten poems with emphatic markings, often in pencil—adding another stratum
                  to their textual archaeology. While our emphasis is on the poetry within DCMS 120,
                  we also wish to call attention, through the complete table of contents, to the interplay
                  of her poetry with the other material she copies or pastes into the notebook.</p>
               <p>It should be noted as well that many of the poems included here are also preserved
                  in other documents outside of DCMS 120—in notebooks, letters, and separate sheets,
                  as copies Dorothy gifted to others. Nonetheless, we find that focusing on this one
                  notebook and the history of its making and use allows us to reanimate Dorothy’s poetry
                  within the period’s thriving manuscript culture. Though in many ways Dorothy drafted,
                  revised, shared, and preserved her writing as a professional author might, her verse
                  was rarely if ever intended for a print audience. Nonetheless, she had readers. This
                  notebook did not directly serve her brother’s professional literary career, as arguably
                  did the Grasmere journal notebooks and other manuscripts discussed in this edition,
                  but this does not mean that Dorothy did not share her poetry or intend it to be read
                  and enjoyed by others. Rather, DCMS 120 reflects both the social activities of composing,
                  gifting, exchanging, and collecting, as well as Dorothy’s possibly more private processes,
                  particularly with poetry, of recopying, rereading, and rewriting. </p>
               <p>A commonplace book is traditionally understood to be a handmade collection of edifying
                  or inspiring quotations that reflect upon the collector’s reading. Although the term
                  has developed a more capacious meaning, partly because commonplacing became less systematized
                  in the nineteenth century, it is nevertheless somewhat misapplied to Dorothy’s notebook,
                  which is only in part an account of her reading. DCMS 120 might more accurately be
                  called a manuscript miscellany, exemplifying a traditional method of curation that
                  thrived in the eighteenth century, particularly for poetry; the miscellany can also
                  be, as it is in this case, a space for drafting, collecting, and preserving heterogeneous
                  material. As noted previously, one of DCMS 120’s most important functions was to gather
                  both drafts and fair copies of nearly all of Dorothy’s poems. However, it also included
                  poetry and prose authored by others, in a variety of forms. Dorothy preserved this
                  material both through the act of directly copying onto pages in the notebook and by
                  pasting loose sheets into the notebook pages. The manuscript miscellany gathers contributions
                  from various sources and people into a single (if somewhat chaotic) space, both representing
                  and embodying a literary community. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>One advantage of studying and editing a single notebook, then, is that it provides
                     access to the messy and complex nature of manuscript writing and literary exchange.
                     One disadvantage is that approaching such a collection can feel unfamiliar and even
                     alienating. DCMS 120 defies many expectations of today’s readers, who are used to
                     encountering regularized print. Like DCMS 20, it starts at both ends, a feature that
                     Margaret Ezell describes as “a doubling of the matter in an inverted format,” resulting
                     in “a practice alien to print technology . . . and disorienting for modern readers.” 
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

                              “Invisible Books,”

                     </div> As in other draft manuscripts, corrections, revisions, and errors remain visible in
                     layers, as Dorothy works and reworks her lines. Time is thus encoded on the pages
                     in a way that is distinctive to the scribal medium. Meanwhile, white space within
                     the manuscript is unevenly distributed, with some pages left entirely blank, some
                     barely written on, and others crammed with writing. There are pages cut or torn or
                     patched, all contributing to a lack of uniformity that is indicative of the book being
                     filled over time, without a predetermined plan. Text appears at multiple angles and
                     cross-written; there are sheets pasted in horizontally that must be folded out, and
                     the entire book must be manipulated and rotated throughout for proper reading. There
                     are essentially no navigational tools—no tables of contents, indices, signatures,
                     attributions, or page numbers, and very few titles. Legibility, regularity, and re-usability
                     are all compromised. In many ways, then, the notebook is impenetrable to us—undecipherable
                     in places, with missing pages, unknown hands, and unidentified scraps copied and clipped
                     from print and manuscript sources. It is a book in which we struggle to find a single
                     or clear narrative except of use and ongoing engagement. Nonetheless, its tolerance
                     of variation and indeed messiness—the willingness to allow for corrections and variants
                     to remain visible, with draft and fair copies remaining side by side—enables a revisiting
                     of past versions and past selves, very much a Wordsworthian theme at the core of Dorothy’s
                     as well as her brother’s poetics.</p>

                  details. Figure 6.3 reproduces and enlarges the page’s penultimate stanza. Here, Dorothy
                  recopies, twice, in pencil, the expression “Trust me” from the stanza’s first line,
                  strongly emphasizing its message on the passage of time: “Too soon your hearts shall
                  own / The past is all that is your own.” Thus, the manuscript carries a sting—a poignant
                  indication of the poet’s feeling in later life. </p>

                     </div> Dorothy Wordsworth occupies the same double or multiple positionality, as an older
                     self often encircles a younger one in poems that themselves thematize the passage
                     of time. In this way, throughout DCMS 120, we observe traces of Dorothy rereading
                     and reworking her own life. Often her revisions are less about altering the meaning
                     and more about accentuating and perhaps even, in the act of rewriting, re-experiencing
                     feelings. As Pamela Woof perceptively observes, “The constant return to lines and
                     snatches from the poems provides for her a way to investigate her own mind.”

                     and written in the hands of family or friends. Though this introduction primarily
                     addresses the poems contained in DCMS 120 and the practices of drafting, revision,
                     collection, and sharing revealed within its pages, it is important to acknowledge
                     the notebook’s place within a larger set of surviving documents that demonstrate Dorothy
                     writing and sharing her verses.</p>
               </div>
               <p>While many of the poems are hard to date with precision, most seem to have been written
                  in the 1820s and 1830s, when Dorothy was in her 50s and 60s and living at Rydal Mount
                  with William and his family. As a result, the poems trace themes that are somewhat
                  different from those that dominate her earlier writing, for example, in the first
                  Grasmere journal notebook, before William had a wife and children. The passage of
                  time and its effects on the body and her familial and social relationships are constant
                  themes of the poems, as Dorothy reflects on both her younger and older selves. A few
                  poems do return to quite early times; for instance, 
                  “Grasmere—A Fragment”
                  recounts the Wordsworths’ arrival in Grasmere in late 1799. Nevertheless, most of
                  the poems differ from the descriptions of daily life and local scenes that are found
                  in the <em>Grasmere Journals</em>, being more centrally focused on her anxiety about writing poetry (an insecurity
                  not much expressed in her other writing) and her reflections on aging and the fragility
                  of the body.</p>

                     chiefly to attach copies of her poems made by others, with the first copy pasted in

                     and quasi-patron Lady Beaumont encouraged her to try verse, Dorothy responded with
                     a detailed history of her efforts in the genre that is worth quoting at length: <span class="quote">‘Believe me, since I received your letter I have made several attempts (could I do

                        vanity to suppose could be of any use beyond our own fireside, or to please, as in
                        your case, a few partial friends; but I have no command of language, no power of expressing
                        my ideas, and no one was ever more inapt at molding words into regular metre. I have
                        often tried when I have been walking alone (muttering to myself as is my Brother’s
                        custom) to express my feelings in verse; feelings, and ideas such as they were, I
                        have never wanted at those times; but prose and rhyme and blank verse were jumbled

                     Wordsworth scholar Ernest de Sélincourt, for one, concluded that her poems “have little
                     intrinsic merit,” opining that “only rarely are they lit up by that alertness of vision
                     and felicity of phrasing of which to the last her prose was capable.”

                     Susan Levin, summed up the enduring consensus that “uneven in quality, Dorothy’s poetry
                     sometimes has the effect of making us more appreciative of her talents as a prose
                     writer.”

                  <p>In the aforementioned letter to Lady Beaumont, Dorothy claims to have no expressive
                     power or metrical ability; however, she was in a singularly challenging position in
                     attempting to compose poetry alongside her brother, particularly in 1806, when William
                     was writing some of the finest poetry of his life. Levin describes this “anxiety of
                     influence” making it “difficult for Dorothy to write poetry.” In this reading, Dorothy’s
                     habitual self-denigration is everywhere evident as she sets her poems against his.

                     Pollard Marshall, was Dorothy’s lifelong friend, she explores her fraught relationship
                     with poetry. She returns to her childhood and explains that, even though she “reverenced the

                  for the numbers came”—Dorothy explains the fear of humiliation that prevented her
                  from pursuing poetry. Writing these lines in 1827, she had not yet forgotten the unnamed
                  “elder heads” and “playmates” who “stifle[d]” her poetic ambition as a child, many
                  decades earlier.</p>

                     </div> Unlike her brother, Dorothy did not regularly compose poetry with print publication
                     in mind. Instead, she usually addressed her poems to specific individuals, or to commemorate
                     specific experiences or events. As she explains in the 1806 letter to Lady Beaumont,
                     she wrote primarily for friends and family, rarely imagining an audience that extended
                     “beyond [their] own fireside.” She also appears to have found it difficult to write
                     upon command, as her friends’ requests for verse often languished. For the most part,
                     Dorothy seems to have written when inspired, to reflect on stirring moments, or to
                     express special friendship. Though she preserved only a small number of poems, she
                     returned to many of these, reworking and copying them for friends and family. Some
                     of the poems, of course, found enthusiastic readers, as when Charles and Mary Lamb
                     praised “Address to a Child” as “masterly.”

                  <p>In several poems, Dorothy writes as a fixture in her brother’s home and loving aunt
                     to his children. As Levin has observed, “Many of Dorothy’s poems are written in the
                     voice of a woman who considers her life and her past in relation to the children or
                     younger women around her.”

                     </div> Importantly, of the five Dorothy poems published with William’s during her lifetime,
                     four of them explicitly position her as a maiden aunt or caregiver, casting her into
                     a role of helpmate that continues to shape understandings of her and her writing.
                     The titles of the three early poems published in 1815 describe her helping to rear
                     Dora (born in 1804), Thomas (1806), Catherine (1808), and Willy (1810). By contrast,
                     among the later poems included in DCMS 120, only 
                     “Loving &amp; Liking”
                      addresses a young child, gently admonishing its addressee for claiming to love roasted
                     fowl. The speaker of the poem instructs the child that animals can be loved only in
                     their natural environments, not when they have been made to serve human needs or tastes.</p>
               </div>
               <p>By the 1820s and 1830s, the children have grown up. Two poems from 1832, respectively,
                  address Edith Southey, daughter of Robert, and Dora, intimate friends for whom Dorothy
                  had been something of a surrogate mother. Both had turned 28 in 1832, and, as is apparent
                  from her titles—
                  “Lines intended for my Niece’s Album”
                  (12, 13) and 
                  “Lines intended for Edith Southey’s album”
                  (14)—Dorothy intended these poems, along with 
                  “Lines to Dora”
                  (35, 36) from 1835, for the young women’s personal album collections. Especially popular
                  among young British ladies of the 1820s and 1830s, albums were blank notebooks or
                  scrapbooks that gathered autographs and poetry, often solicited as were the lines
                  from Dorothy. In her album verses, we find Dorothy contemplating the nature of the
                  subgenre, the difficulties encountered in attempting to write on command (the title
                  describes 
                  “Lines intended for Edith Southey’s album”
                  as responding to “a request made by her some years ago, &amp; of my own promise till now
                  unfulfilled”) and, more broadly, her struggle to write poetry at all.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In “Lines intended for my Niece’s Album,” Dorothy asks, “But why should I inscribe
                     my name, / No Poet I — no longer young?” In such verses, Dorothy associates poetry
                     with youth, expressing amusement and perhaps discomfort with being a sexagenarian
                     generator of keepsakes. Some months later, she signs herself, in a poem addressed
                     to Edith’s sister, “Miss Bertha Southey,” as “D. Wordsworth Old Poetess. Oct. 7th
                     1836.” Most of her surviving poems were composed in her 50s and 60s, and in them she
                     regularly plays the role of the “aged Friend, ” as she puts it in “Lines intended
                     for my Niece’s Album.” Levin observes that poems to the younger generation afforded
                     Dorothy an opportunity to meditate upon her own past and present: <span class="quote">‘In certain of her poems, an older, sickly, “enfeebled” speaker addresses a young woman
                        who serves as both her contrast and complement. The writing of the poems establishes
                        a series of oppositions such as youth/age, health/sickness, freedom in nature/sickroom
                        as prison. Setting out these positions in composing the poem, the narrator encounters
                        her own youthful energies mirrored in the young women she addresses. ’</span>

               <p>Other poems where Dorothy employs such doubling include

                  which reflects on the difference between the poet’s and subject’s younger selves;
                  
                  “Irregular Stanzas / Holiday at Gwerndovennant May 1826,”
                  in which, addressing a group of children surrounding the adults, she considers, “Forty
                  years have roll’d away / Since we were young as you”; and 
                  “Irregular Verses,”
                  another poem to Julia Marshall, in which she addresses the separation between the
                  two women and the difference in their lots in life, as Jane Marshall has gone on to
                  have 10 children. But most memorably she uses this trope in her album verses for Dora
                  and Edith, the latter of which offers a noteworthy celebration of the bonds between
                  the generations: </p>

                  <p>In the poignant 
                     “Thoughts on my Sick-Bed,”
                      it is memory that rescues Dorothy from the captivity of illness. The poem is dated
                     to the early spring of 1832, after her first extended period of confinement that began
                     in 1830. Much like Coleridge’s 1797 poem 
                     “This Lime Tree Bower, my Prison,”
                      in which Coleridge laments being unable to join his friends on a ramble due to a recent
                     injury, 
                     “Thoughts on my Sick-Bed,”
                      depicts Dorothy imprisoned in her room at Rydal Mount. The speaker, for whom walking
                     outdoors has been such an important part of life, now finds herself disabled. But,
                     like Coleridge, she rejoices in the creative powers that allow her to imagine that
                     she is not confined, and she ultimately refutes her entrapment. “I thought of Nature’s
                     loveliest scenes,” she concludes, “And with Memory I was there.” In “This Lime Tree
                     Bower, my Prison,” Coleridge finds that neither nature nor his friends have deserted
                     him, as he enjoys the capacity to traverse space in his mind’s eye, providing him
                     much to delight and soothe him. For Dorothy, a gift of spring flowers, brought by
                     friends, spurs the powers of her imagination and transports her beyond the four walls

                  a faith in the restorative powers of the imagination. As in

                  Dorothy claims in “Thoughts on my Sick-Bed” that there has been what her brother termed
                  “abundant recompense” for what has been lost: </p>

               <p>In short, 
                  “Thoughts on My Sick-Bed,”
                  one of her most personal and meditative poems, is also arguably one of her best. It
                  is also highly allusive, as it gestures toward her brother’s and Coleridge’s poems
                  in order to underscore the fundamental shared argument about the powers of friendship,
                  memory, and the imagination, and to draw the poems, and the poets, together.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the memory-poem most indebted to her brother and most grounded in their common
                  life in the Lakes is 
                  “Grasmere—A Fragment,”
                  an undated poem that reflects on the siblings’ arrival in the village in December
                  1799. It is a poem that, like her brother’s 
                  “Home at Grasmere ”
                  (1800), reflects both on their return to the Lake District to establish a home and
                  on the meaning of home itself. Four versions of 
                  “Grasmere —A Fragment,”
                  all with revisions, are included in DCMS 120, suggesting it was important to Dorothy
                  and part of a family dialogue about the meaning of their shared life. The poem describes
                  a sense of deep satisfaction upon viewing Dove Cottage, which, “with its clustering
                  trees / Summons [her] heart.” Although it is little more than a “shed,” modest in
                  comparison to some neighboring homes, with no fertile fields but a rocky steep that
                  rises behind, she declares, “I love that house because it is / The very mountains’
                  child.”</p>
               <p>The poem proceeds to describe the “lovely winter’s day” when the Wordsworths moved
                  into Dove Cottage. Soon after arriving, Dorothy writes: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">

               <p> This scene, in which Dorothy leaves her brother behind “to wander out alone, ” reflects
                  her newfound autonomy, whereas the actual “little winding path” that leads her up
                  the hills hints at the opportunities for walking and exploration soon to come. The
                  poem also addresses the delight she finds in the wintery scenes on display: </p>

                  “Grasmere—A Fragment”
                  describes Dove Cottage and its environs in idealized terms, as sheltered, verdant,

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Reflections on those early wishes also appear in Dorothy’s 
                     “Irregular Verses.”
                      She recalls that she had imagined sharing a home with her friend Jane Pollard as well
                     as with William.

                              with Jane Pollard and her brother. For example, on 10 and 12 July 1793, she writes,
                              ‘But oh how imperfect is my pleasure! I am alone; why are not you seated with me?
                              and my dear William why is not he here also? I could almost fancy that I see you both
                              near me. I have chosen a bank where I have room to spare for a resting-place for each
                              of you. I hear you point out a spot where, if we could erect a little cottage and
                              call it our own we should be the happiest of human beings. I see my Brother fired
                              with the idea …</span></div>
                     </div> This ideal, however, did not materialize, as Jane married and had her own family:

                     </blockquote> Dorothy did, of course, establish a household with her brother, and many of her poems
                     celebrate visions of their home, at Dove Cottage until 1808 and at other residences
                     until 1813, when they moved to Rydal Mount, where they would remain until their deaths.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In sum, readers of this edition will be confronted with many poems that describe the
                  long life Dorothy enjoyed with her brother in Grasmere and Rydal; they will encounter
                  multiple versions of many of these poems, and often variant readings within these
                  versions. Our presentation reflects the textually indeterminate state of Dorothy’s
                  writing and attempts to remain faithful to the nature and purpose of her poetic expression.
                  We believe that her poems reward careful reading, both for what they can tell us about
                  her life and for their own sake. They enhance and supplement our understanding of
                  her prose writing. Above all, they give us a picture of an older woman of letters
                  seeking to process her experiences in poetic forms. </p>

               <p>DCMS 120 is a hardcover book with mottled brown paper boards, containing 89 leaves
                  and measuring 276 mm (height) x 215 mm (width). As discussed previously, Dorothy enters
                  most of the contents of the notebook from the front of the book, with the front being
                  determined by the cover with a stationer’s label, and the last entry written on 59r.
                  When opened and read in this direction, certain leaves or pages are blank (7v, 23,
                  25v, 26r, 33v, 35–36r, 41r, 42, 43r, 45v, 48v, 50, 51v, 57v, 59v, 61–78), and some
                  folios are stubs—that is, pages that have been cut or torn out (27, 30, 34, 46, 46,
                  60). When opening the book from the other direction, the last piece of writing appears
                  on 15v, with no blanks and one stub, on folio 8. There is no observable pattern that
                  distinguishes material entered at either end, as both have Dorothy’s own poems along
                  with copied material. There are 12 inserts—that is, materials extraneous to the notebook
                  that have been pasted in. These inserts are both complete poems (by Dorothy and others,
                  usually written out by others) as well as patches added to provide correct poems.

               “An Address to a Child, During a boisterous Winter Evening”
               (pp. 8–10), 
               “The Mother’s Return”
               (pp. 11–13), and 
               “The Cottager to Her Infant”
               (p. 160). In his famous 
               “Preface”
               to this collection, WW noted, “Three short pieces (now first published) are the work
               of a Female Friend; and the Reader, to whom they may be acceptable, is indebted to
               me for his pleasure; if any one regard them with dislike, or be disposed to condemn
               them, let the censure fall upon him, who, trusting in his own sense of their merit
               and their fitness for the place which they occupy, <em>extorted</em> them from the Authoress” (xli). For the siblings’ longtime friend Charles Lamb and
               his sister Mary, however, this was overly coy. In a 7 April 1815 letter to WW, Charles
               Lamb remarks, “We were glad to see the poems by a female friend. The one of the wind
               is masterly, but not new to us. Being only three, perhaps you might have clapt a D.
               at the corner and let it have past as a printer’s mark to the uninitiated, as a delightful
               hint to the better-instructed. As it is, Expect a formal criticism on the Poems of
               your female friend, and she must expect it” (<em>Letters of Charles and Mary Lamb</em>, 1:141). WW did eventually accept this advice, including DW’s initials in some later
               editions.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               <span class="quote">‘But oh how imperfect is my pleasure! I am <em>alone</em>; why are not you seated with me? and my dear William why is not he here also? I could
                  almost fancy that I see you both near me. I have chosen a bank where I have room to
                  spare for a resting-place for each of you. I hear <em>you</em> point out a spot where, if we could erect a little cottage and call it <em>our own</em> we should be the happiest of human beings. I see my Brother fired with the idea of
                  leading his sister to such a retreat as Fancy ever ready at our call hastens to assist
                  us in painting; our parlor is in a moment furnished; our garden is adorned by magic;
                  the roses and honeysuckles spring at our command, the wood behind the house lifts
                  at once its head and furnishes us with a winter’s shelter, and a summer’s noon-day
                  shade. My dear friend I trust that ere long you will be, without the aid of imagination,
