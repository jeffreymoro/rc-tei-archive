                    In Dorothy’s account she is mentioned but not named (e.g., “We had some miles to travel to the foot of the mountain,
                    and accordingly went thither in a cart—Miss Barker, her maid, and myself”). She is identified as Agnes in Jonathan
                    Otley’s May 1855 letter to the editor of the <title level="m">Kendal Mercury</title>, which notes that Agnes also
                    accompanied Mary Barker on her first visit to Esk Hause. In 1819, she accompanied Barker to her new home in Boulogne,
                    France.</p>

              <p>A lively friend of Dorothy who was a writer, a music teacher, an amateur painter, and a fell walker. Mary met Robert Southey
                 in Portugal in 1800 and became a close friend, eventually settling next door to his family in Keswick (1812–1817). Over time,
                 she became acquainted with the broader Southey-Coleridge-Wordsworth circle, close especially with Dorothy and Sara Hutchinson.
                 In 1816, she overextended herself financially to build a new home in Rosthwaite, Borrowdale, where she lived for just a short
                 time, despite her love for the landscape and having become an “active climber of the hills.” This house was the starting place
                 for the 1818 Scafell Pike. In the following year, Mary moved to Boulogne in order to retrench and never returned to England,
                 but the Wordsworths continued to correspond with her, and they visited her in France during their 1820 Continental Tour. In
                 1830, she married a younger man named Mr. Slade, concerning her friends at home. The most complete source on her life is David

                    Lord Chief Justice John Willes, in 1778, and the two honeymooned at Keswick. Revisiting the town 25 years later, they met the
                    Coleridges, Southeys, and William Wordsworth. Soon thereafter, Lady Margaret and Dorothy struck up an epistolary friendship, and,
                    although they wouldn’t meet in person until 1806, Dorothy apparently composed her journal-like “Excursion on the Banks of Ullswater” 
                    for her new friend in 1805. In later years the Wordsworths would regularly visit them at their Leicestershire estate, Coleorton, and

                    friend and later biographer Robert Southey. According to Southey’s <title level="m">Life</title>, after Bell requested Dorothy’s
                    feedback on his Madras school book, she “spent much time and labour in remodeling the work for him, and, indeed, entirely rewrote
                    it, much to his apparent satisfaction at the time; subsequently, however, he threw this manuscript aside, and published it nearly
                    as he had originally composed it.” William Johnson, the addressee of Dorothy’s 1818 Scafell Pike letter, was the head of Bell’s
                    Central School in London. As a link between Dorothy, Johnson, and Lord Kenyon, Bell may have been involved in the production of the
                    “Kenyon Transcript.” By his death in 1832, his National Society for the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the Christian Church

                     later, he married Catherine Buck of Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, a like-minded gentlewoman. According to her childhood friend (and later
                     boon companion of the Wordsworths) Henry Crabb Robinson, she “was the most eloquent woman I have ever known, with the exception of Madame
                     de Staël. She had a quick apprehension of every kind of beauty and made her own whatever she learned.” Though the Clarksons left the
                     Lakes in 1804, when Thomas returned to public life, their friendship with the Wordsworths endured and Caroline became one of Dorothy’s
                     most regular correspondents. In 1807, Thomas would help achieve the long-delayed passage of the Slave Trade Act.</p>

                    Sara, moved to Greta Hall in Keswick, 13 miles from Dove Cottage. In 1804, he left Keswick (and his troubled marriage) for Malta 
                    and Italy in hopes of recovering his physical and mental health. He returned little recovered in 1806 and almost immediately 
                    separated from his wife, leaving her and his daughter at Keswick with the Southeys but arranging for his boys to attend school 
                    in Ambleside. Between frequent stints as the Wordsworths’ houseguest, he spent much of 1807–1808 lecturing and writing in London 
                    and most of 1809 and early 1810 back in the Lakes launching his new journal,<title level="m">The Friend</title>. After he

                    in 1799 (distressing all families concerned), she was an eager mountaineer, a lively correspondent, and a keen mind. It was to 
                    her that Dorothy and Mary Barker wrote from the summit of Scafell Pike in 1818. Coleridge said of Sara, “If Sense, Sensibility, 
                    Sweetness of Temper, perfect Simplicity and an unpretending Nature, joined to shrewdness &amp; entertainingness, make a valuable 
                    Woman, Sarah H. is so.” Joanna was the youngest Hutchinson sister, also unmarried, and also a frequent visitor and companion to 
                    Dorothy. Together they traveled to Scotland in 1822 and the Isle of Man in 1828. Dorothy wrote “Lines addressed to Joanna H. from 
                    Gwerndovennant June 1826” to this valued sister-in-law. Sara and Joanna both kept house at times for their brother Thomas, who

                <p>William Johnson, former curate and schoolmaster in Grasmere (1811–1812), was the recipient of the October 1818 letter that contained
                    Dorothy’s account of ascending Scafell Pike. He was intimate with the Wordsworths, and Sara Hutchinson’s letters indicate that he was
                    thought a possible match for her sister Joanna. Johnson was born in Cumberland but ended up spending much of his career in London, 
                    having been hired by Dr. Andrew Bell to run a new model school established by the National Society for the Education of the Poor in
                    the Principles of the Established Church. His work in training students and fellow teachers was essential to the success of the 
                    National Society and of Bell’s Madras system. When he died, an obituary in <title level="m">The Gentleman’s Magazine</title>called 
                    him “the Patriarch of National Education.”</p>

                <p>Historians remember Lord Kenyon primarily as an activist against Catholic emancipation, but he enters Dorothy Wordsworth’s orbit
                    as an associate of Dr. Andrew Bell and Rev. William Johnson. Kenyon, an important lawyer and landowner in North Wales, served 
                    with Bell and Johnson as one of the leaders of the National Society for the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the 
                    Established Church. The second surviving manuscript witness of Dorothy’s 1818 Scafell Pike ascent (a copy made by an unknown hand)
                    was sent to the Hutchinsons under his franking privilege. For this reason, we refer to it as the “Kenyon Transcript.” </p>

                    where Charles died in 1815. Letitia returned to England, living at Dale Lodge in Grasmere before purchasing and renovating Fox Ghyll

                    flax-spinning factory into a fortune of roughly £2 million. From 1815 onward, the couple resided at Hallsteads on the shore
                    of Ullswater. Notwithstanding political differences—John enthusiastically supported progressive causes and served as a Whig 
                    MP from 1826 to 1830—the Marshalls remained friends with the considerably more conservative Wordsworths until death. The

                <p> William and Dorothy’s youngest sibling. He spent most of adolescence at Hawkshead Grammar School before matriculating at Trinity
                    College, Cambridge, in 1792. He eventually received three degrees: a BA in 1796, MA in 1799, and DD in 1810. Largely through his 
                    connections with the archbishop of Canterbury, he became a rector in Norfolk in 1804 and domestic chaplain to the archbishop a 
                    year later. In later years, he would hold a series of clerical and academic appointments, which provided a platform for his regular
                    defenses of conservative and High Church causes. His largest impact, however, came as an administrator at Trinity College, Cambridge,
                    during the 1820s and 1830s, where he oversaw a series of educational and clerical reforms. In 1804 he married Priscilla Lloyd, the 
                    daughter of a wealthy Birmingham banker who, after bearing three sons, tragically died in 1815.</hi></p>

                <p>William and Mary Wordsworth’s oldest and only surviving daughter, who was particularly close to her father and protective of his literary
                    reputation. Her namesake, Dorothy, was something of a third parent to her, often serving as her main disciplinarian and nursing her through
                    chronic illnesses. After struggling in various educational establishments, Dora flourished when Ann Dowling took over the girls’ school 
                    in Ambleside in 1818. In adulthood, Dora gradually replaced Dorothy as William’s principal scribe and traveling companion, accompanying 
                    him and Coleridge on their summer 1828 tour of Northern Europe. In 1839, William rejected Edward Quillinan’s request for Dora’s hand, 
                    ostensibly because of this family friend’s Catholicism and troubled finances but also because of the poet’s deep dependence on his daughter.
                    Eventually, however, he relented and blessed the couple’s May 1841 union. After convalescing from a serious illness in Portugal in 1845 and
                    1846, Dora returned to Rydal Mount, dying there in July 1847.</p>

                    youth of about fifteen years of age. He is able to do any kind of work, but prefers sitting to standing, riding to walking, and
                    lying in bed to anything in the world.” Forbidden by his parents from joining the army in 1828, Willy remained largely aimless 
                    until his father made him his Sub-distributor of Stamps in 1831, which paved the way for him to replace William as Distributor 
                    in 1842. He married Fanny Eliza Graham in 1847, with whom he had four children.</p>
