He appears to use DCMS 51 as his base text, but if that is the case, he presumably depends on another manuscript for all of the material from “It is a Ship” to “our far distant friend in S. Wales, Miss Hutchinson”—text missing from the torn notebook page. He might turn to the Kenyon Transcript, but some of his readings differ slightly from that witness. For instance, he ends with “Miss Hutchinson” where the Kenyon Transcript has “Sara Hutchinson”; he has “I hope, when again inclined to positiveness, I may remember” where the Keynon Transcript has “I hope when I am again inclined to positiveness, I may remember.” Finally, De Sélincourt has “submissiveness” where the Kenyon Transcript has “submission.” Are these mistakes? Silent emendations? Did De Sélincourt have access to a manuscript that has since been lost? Or, alternately, was the torn last page of DCMS 51 still intact when he did his work? Even that last circumstance would not explain all the variants, as DCMS 51 clearly has “Sara Hutchinson” rather than “Miss Hutchinson.”</hi></p></note></hi> “A Ship!</p><p>yes it can be nothing else don’t you </p><p>see the shape of it?” Miss Barker</p><p>interposed, “It is a Ship [pen, indecipherable cancel] </p><p><hi rend="color(984806)">[Page Break—end p. 58, 30v]</hi></p><p>[31r torn, mostly missing, bottom of page survives]</p><p>of</p><p>our </p><p>-mon performances</p><p>-ker &amp; I each wrote a </p><p>Top of the Pike of Scaw Fell</p><p>distant Friend, Sara Hutchin</p><p>South Wales.</p><p>October 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1818</p><p>Went up Scaw Fell on Wednesday the</p><p>7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> October -1818</p><p> <hi rend="color(984806)">[Page Break—end p. 59, 31r.
