                        in both pen and pencil. Previous editors have assumed that the pencil marks are William Wordsworth&#8217;s, noting that many of these 
                        changes appeared in the version published in the third edition of his <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title> (1823).
                        <note place="foot" resp="editors">Owen and Smyser, for instance, write, &#8220;It is usually easy to discriminate between 
                        corrections made by Dorothy while she was in the process of making her own extract from her letter to Johnson and corrections
                        made a few years later when the 1822 <title level="m">Guide</title> was being prepared&#8221; (<title level="m">Prose</title>,
                        2:362). This is, as they say, &#8220;usually&#8221; true, but not always.</note> This theory is plausible; however, both William
                        and Dorothy appear to have undertaken multiple rounds of edits between 1818 and the text&#8217;s 1822 publication, and it is difficult to
                        tell which edits belong to which hand. The diplomatic transcription that follows therefore aims to include all markings, including
                        lines and symbols for deletions or insertions that are difficult to reproduce typographically. Unfortunately, the final page of DCMS
                        51 is badly torn. For the missing text, readers must consult a second manuscript source, which we refer to as the

                       use DCMS 51 as his base text, but if that is the case, he presumably depends on another manuscript for all of the material from

                       to positiveness, I may remember.&#8221; Finally, De Sélincourt has &#8220;submissiveness&#8221; where the Kenyon Transcript has

                       been lost? Or, alternately, was the torn last page of DCMS 51 still intact when he did his work? Even that last circumstance would
