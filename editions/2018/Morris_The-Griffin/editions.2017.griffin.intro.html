                     ‘maiden effort of an Indian Subaltern’s Muse’, supposedly published in an unnamed

               <p><em>The Griffin</em> is accompanied in this edition by two sets of related texts. One comprises Morris’s

                  of <em>The Griffin</em> in the <em>Bombay Gazette</em> and the <em>Bombay Courier</em>, under the pseudonyms ‘M.E.’ and ‘Uxorius’. These texts are forerunners and in some
                  cases proto-fragments of the longer work; they anticipate its concerns (primarily
                  the love affair at the heart of <em>The Griffin</em>, but also its observations of the world of Bombay), and they experiment with the
                  characters and situations that would later form part of the review / poem.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The other set of related texts is constituted by letters of commentary and criticism
                     to the editors of the same newspapers, some in prose and some in verse, interspersed
                     with the instalments of <em>The Griffin</em> throughout the course of its publication. Two of these raise queries about the authenticity
                     of ‘The Griffin’ and the identity of its author. Others contest, or appear to contest,
                     its misogyny, although the tone of these communications – ‘A blush of Maiden modesty
                     suffuses my cheeks while forming this Epistle, the first I ever wrote to one of the
                     male sex’ – indicates their satiric intent.

                     suitors, together with her rejoicing in the prospect of another ‘<em>thirty </em>years to flirt about, before I am <em>on the list</em> of antiquated virginity’, and her contemptuous dismissal of ‘that superficial Griffin’,
                     reads like a continuation outside the text of <em>The Griffin</em> of the sex wars fought within it. Given the way in which these letters enter into
                     and exacerbate <em>The Griffin</em>’s themes of misogyny, conflict and satiric representation of individuals, it is very
                     possible that some are the work of Morris himself – a theory borne out by his production
                     of similar pseudonymous critical responses to his own works in the <em>Oriental Sporting Magazine</em>.

                     (see below), there are few personal remnants of his life and work. The exception is
                     a letter to Mountstuart Elphinstone, Governor of Bombay 1819-1827 (the original survives
                     among Elphinstone’s papers), communicating a request for preferment. Responding to
                     the prospect of changes in the Pay Department (to which Elphinstone had nominated
                     him in November 1824) which might deprive him of his post as deputy paymaster, he
                     refers to the ‘marks of kindness’ already received from Elphinstone, and requests
                     that ‘should any change in the Pay Department take place, I beg my dear sir that you
                     will send me to the Deccan where the earliest &amp; happiest days of my service have been

               <p>Morris’s reference to his service in the Deccan foregrounds his personal involvement
                  in the military actions of the early nineteenth century, a series of campaigns culminating
                  in the third Anglo-Maratha war of 1817-1818. This conflict, resulting in defeat for
                  the Maratha Confederacy which had controlled much of north and central India, paved
                  the way for the consolidation of British power in the Deccan, and the expansion of
                  the administrative area of the Bombay Presidency. These events underlie the personal
                  stories of <em>The Griffin</em> and the early poems, and their associated geographical and military landmarks also
                  constitute a zone of mutual understanding between Morris and his first readers, many
                  of whom were also participants in the East India Company’s civil and military establishment
                  in Bombay. The defeat twice over of Maratha forces at the battles of Kirkee (Khadki)
                  and Ashtee (Ashta) in late 1817, occasions which form the background to the second
                  instalment of <em>The Griffin</em>, was crucial to the Company’s achievement of control over the Deccan. The places
                  invoked throughout the text – such as Poona (Poonah, Pune) and Sholapoor (Solapur),
                  both locations where Morris had served – are part of that recently conquered territory,
                  and demonstrate the extent to which the immediate history of the colony is already
                  informing its literature.</p>

                  <p>This court martial was the outcome of a series of interactions between Morris and
                     another officer, Frederick Hickes. Morris was charged with ‘disgraceful conduct, unbecoming
                     the Character of an Officer and a Gentleman’ on two counts relating to the practice
                     of settling differences or avenging insults by means of a duel. In 1821, immediately
                     following publication of the final instalment of <em>The Griffin</em>, he had refused to respond appropriately (presumably by issuing a challenge to fight)
                     when Hickes insulted him with ‘the most opprobrious Epithets’.

                     June 1821. If Catharine Billamore is the subject of the lines ‘To C—B—’, published
                     by Morris in May 1819, she was at the time of her marriage also the subject of Morris’s
                     attention, and may have made some kind of promise to him, which she reneged on in
                     order to marry Hickes. This work points to a romantic interest – initially requited
                     – between them, where Catharine’s repudiation of Morris and marriage to Hickes became
                     the occasion of a series of self-involved narratives of love and rejection. ‘To C—B—’
                     reproaches its subject with ‘faithlessness’, and represents her as thoughtlessly abandoning
                     the writer for another:

                     of the abandoned lover’s story. An early ‘Fragment’ of what would become <em>The Griffin</em> gives the woman in question the suggestively acronymical name of ‘Carineth’, and has
                     the speaker, Daric (a near miss for ‘D’Arcy’), return from battle to find her ‘Wedded
                     to him, my best, my bosom friend’. This situation is replicated in the prose ‘Eastern
                     Vision’ where the narrator reflects on ‘the fate of many a warm hearted Youth, who
                     relying upon the virgin-vows of some impatient female, obey’d the calls of Duty and
                     Honour and returned to the object of his Adoration <em>time enough</em> to find her “The Bride of Another”!!’

                     matrimony “almost unsought and totally unwoo’d”’, it is in the context of a work which

                     other circumstance, changed Morris’s mind. On his return to Bombay in July 1823, he
                     resumed hostilities with Hickes, this time as the aggressor, sending a message intended
                     ‘to provoke … Hickes to fight a Duel on grounds connected with the … circumstances’

                     out that the evidence unequivocally indicated his guilt, suggests that they had some

               <p>These early works turn in each case on a scene of trauma and betrayal experienced
                  by a protagonist who returns from battle to find that his promised beloved has married
                  his friend. The ‘warm hearted Youth’ of ‘An Eastern Vision’ finds ‘the object of his
                  Adoration’ has become ‘The Bride of Another’; the addressee of ‘To C—.B—.’ has ‘Leapt
                  to <em>another’s</em> arms’; the Carineth of ‘A Fragment’ is ‘Wedded to him, my best, my bosom friend’,
                  and so on. The explanation for her conduct is variously given as ‘woman’s fickleness’,
                  faithlessness, impatience – the qualities of what ‘Observer XIV’ terms a ‘<em>true woman</em>’. The overriding point is clearly about the infidelity of women, and the impact of
                  this particular woman’s betrayal of the man who loved her.</p>
               <p>In <em>The Griffin</em>, a more complicated story is alluded to. The reviewer’s remarks on Canto 4 suggest
                  that the reason for the breakdown of relations between Carineth and Daric appears
                  to be on his side, rather than hers – ‘he had found means to communicate to her that
                  an invincible obstacle prevented their Union’ – and are thus at odds with the version
                  offered in the earlier fragments, where Daric is represented as overcome by her decision
                  to send him away. In Canto 6, a different version again: ‘Soon after the rupture between
                  Babille and the Griffin, Carineth, who had watched the progress of the Amour, now
                  treats him with marked reserve and almost merited Contempt’. She eventually rejects
                  him, leaving him ‘to wander thro’ the world the victim of a hopeless passion – a prey
                  to miserable and vain regret whilst the object of his affections, enters the pale
                  of matrimony “almost unsought and totally unwoo’d.”’ Here, unlike any of the earlier
                  versions, the woman’s point of view is given, and given in direct speech: </p>

                  faithlessness, might be attributable to a changing mood of the writer, or to the narrative
                  complexity inherent in the longer form of the review / poem, where multiple characters
                  and episodes complicate the spare landscape of the earlier texts. Nonetheless, the
                  attitude to women more generally expressed by the writer remains constant, as the
                  more nuanced representation of Carineth is accompanied by the deployment of the freakishly
                  untrustworthy ‘woman-Serpent’ Babille, false from her hair and her teeth to her ‘flirting,
                  fibbing, scandal and back biting’ (Canto 6, ll. 135-142). As this, rather than the
                  plight of the abandoned lover, strikes the key-note of <em>The Griffin</em>, it suggests that the writer was left with a lasting contempt for his female compatriots.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>One of the most striking aspects of Morris’s work is its misogyny, which finds expression
                     in three ways. First is the resentful depiction of women as status-seeking and faithless,
                     summed up in the embedded poem of ‘The Observer XIV’: the female protagonist is said
                     to value ‘Rank’ in a prospective partner over the quality of a ‘warm’ heart. Her decision
                     to cast aside her lover and marry his friend is represented as a trait of the female
                     sex more generally, rather than indicative of her personal characteristics: the action
                     of a ‘<em>true woman</em>’. Second, the material bodies of women are represented as grotesque and revolting
                     to men, as the apparent allure of Babille, for instance, turns out to conceal a combination
                     of physical repulsiveness and artificial enhancements: 
                     <blockquote class="quote">

                           <div class="l">Her bloom, hair teeth and neck, struck Daric’s senses,</div>

                           <div class="l">And key – with <em>all </em>her little prominences!! (<em>The Griffin</em>, Canto 6, ll. 143-147).<span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
                        </div>
                     </blockquote> Third, the text continually returns to a repetitive trope of entrapment, dwelling
                     on figures such as the ‘dame well-skilled in husband-seeking’ who ‘by some artful
                     and expert manoeuvre / … lures a gilded gudgeon to the Bait’ (Canto 6, l. 250); or
                     Vivian, who uses the spell given her by Merlin to trap him (Canto 6, 115-130). ‘Man
                     is their prey’, the implied poet of ‘The Griffin’ writes (Canto 6, l. 48). The reviewer,
                     for his part, seemingly contests the misogyny of the poem’s text by highlighting ‘the
                     most unpardonable language in which the Author has attempted to degrade the loveliest
                     part of Creation’. This strategy frames and draws attention to exactly the theme it
                     appears to decry, and the brief mention of supportive and beloved ‘Women (and particularly
                     British Women)’ is overshadowed by the account of those ‘females even in India whose
                     turpitude of conduct render them objects of loathing and disgust to every virtuous
                     mind’ (Canto 1). When Daric’s encounter with Marion, his ‘<em>proper </em>Love’, is mentioned by the reviewer, it is simultaneously elided: ‘Her appearance
                     is most interestingly described, her character exquisitely pourtrayed, the opening
                     of his passion and her confession together with their extraordinary adventures and
                     final disappointment, separation and misery, form one of the most pathetic Episodes
                     we have ever read.’ But, the reviewer continues, ‘We will not anticipate the readers
                     delight which this affecting tale will impart...’ (Canto 3). The present, but invisible,
                     phantom of the ‘proper’ woman is contrasted with the all-too-concretely imagined versions
                     of the improper feminine: Babille the ‘Talking shuttle cock’, Pamela with her ‘carrion’
                     breath and addiction to ‘lying and to liquor’.

                     woman is evidence of the importance of this figure to Morris himself. At the same
                     time, a comparable mistrust of women is more widely visible across the periodicals
                     of colonial Bombay. As <em>The Griffin</em> was being published in the <em>Bombay Gazette</em>, another poem in the rival <em>Courier </em>remarked on the immodesty of women (‘nature’s self is frail’, and ‘I’d have maids
                     vestals – till they’re brides’); and the same writer later evokes the spectre of a
                     woman’s corrupt body: ‘the flush of beauty’s face / Hiding disease – by adding grace.’

                     where pay increased only with seniority, leaving junior officers without independent
                     means in often straitened circumstances. (On attaining the rank of major in 1834,
                     Morris was paid nearly three times the amount he received as a lieutenant in 1820,
                     but he had by then been in the Company’s service for twenty-five years.) Simultaneously,
                     the gender imbalance in the makeup of that society – the ‘great number of men’, as
                     Maria Graham puts it, in relation to a small number of women – underlies the sexual

                     is established from the outset. Led by the title to expect a ‘tale of German Horrors,
                     a tissue of deaths heads and blue lights’, rather than the account of a novice traveller
                     to India, he maintains throughout the review a stance of distaste for the world of
                     Bombay, commenting upon the ‘disgusting minuteness’ with which the poem describes

                     are invited to enjoy a position of relative advantage. When the reviewer remarks that
                     ‘the description of [the dawn breaking] appears one of the Author’s best specimens
                     of Eastern scenery, but we leave the greatest portion of it out, that it may reach
                     with all the additional effect of novelty, those who may have witnessed and can better
                     appreciate the local interest’ (Canto 2), he is identifying local readers as privileged
                     – those who can ‘appreciate’ the text – but also underlining the imagined metropolitan
                     reader’s lack of access to the sights and events of the colony.</p>

                     recognizable portraits of individuals. This level of coding is generally inaccessible

                     married couple Janet and Peter. It is nonetheless clear that episodes such as the

                     or hospitality is a dismaying introduction to Bombay, are to be read, contra the reviewer’s

                     readers, these are regional landmarks, familiar as locations associated with the battle
                     of Kirkee and the wider campaign by which the East India Company attained control
                     over the Deccan territories. Colonial readers’ acquaintance with these temporally,
                     politically and geographically specific locations sets them both apart from and (in
                     terms of knowledge and cultural capital) above their counterparts of the metropolis.
                     Similarly, the scene before the battle of Kirkee, in Canto 2 of <em>The Griffin</em>, acknowledges a moment of colonial dependence on the metropolis in Morris’s open
                     imitation of Byron’s <em>Childe Harold</em>, but the battle also signals for the readers of Bombay their own assertion of dominance
                     in India, chronicled in a text prioritising the agenda of the colony. In this way,
                     Morris reverses the polarity of some of the basic literary and political relationships
                     of the Romantic period, contesting the increasingly hegemonic role of publications
                     such as the <em>Edinburgh Review</em> in policing the boundaries of literature, and engaging in the creative appropriation
                     of metropolitan literary forms to give voice to specifically colonial and anti-metropolitan

               <p>In some respects, the appearance of <em>The Griffin</em> fits well into this narrative of Byronic originary force. Morris had been publishing
                  short works exploring the bitter aftermath of rejection in the years immediately preceding
                  the publication of <em>Don Juan</em>, producing a repetitive series of lyric verses focusing on the protagonist’s emotional
                  response to his lover’s betrayal. The series of fragments hints at a larger narrative,
                  but none such is forthcoming. The arrival in India of <em>Don Juan</em> Cantos I and II might be regarded as a turning-point: in August 1820, the first canto
                  of <em>The Griffin</em> makes its appearance, complete with a Byronic protagonist, a narrative of that protagonist’s
                  progress through Bombay society, and a narrative voice and style which consciously
                  and deliberately echoes Byron’s <span class="foreign">ottava rima</span>, his tone and his flamboyant rhymes. The acknowledgement of <em>Don Juan</em> in the opening paragraph is all but superfluous.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>To read <em>Don Juan</em> as a determining force in relation to <em>The Griffin</em> is, however, to overlook several important aspects of the work and its composition.
                     Morris’s fictional construct, with its series of embedded narrative structures, the
                     inbuilt commentary of the review element, and the (probable) accompaniment of the
                     readers’ chorus of the correspondence, draws on a wider and older tradition than that
                     represented simply by Byron’s work. The device of a long narrative poem with prose
                     interludes had been popularized by Thomas Moore’s <em>Lalla Rookh</em>, invoked by Morris in <em>The Griffin</em> (Canto 5). Samuel Richardson’s multi-vocal epistolary novels, with their insistence
                     on deferral of readerly judgement, are invoked in both poem and correspondence, enabling
                     Morris to frame the self-centred lyric lines about Daric’s plight within a construct
                     of distancing and sceptical narrative.

                     Walter Scott’s review suggests) providing a window onto contemporary literature for

                     It may be helpful here to distinguish between the formal aspects of Morris’s work
                     – the playful, multivocal texts where content is nuanced through layers of narrative
                     – and the subject-matter, particularly as that pertains to the concerns and lived
                     experience of British residents in India. On this latter point, there is evidence
                     in the periodical record to suggest that Morris’s work, particularly the sporting
                     texts of the <em>Oriental Sporting Magazine</em>, came to exemplify for readers a golden age of Britain in India, or at least a golden
                     age for British officers of the East India Company, who enjoyed a degree of freedom,
                     autonomy and leisure to follow their own pursuits unattainable for their successors.
                     This is the message of a writer for the <em>Times of India</em> in the 1890s, who sums up his nostalgic retrospective in the remark that ‘There were

                     observable in the years following publication of <em>The Griffin</em>, in the appearance of other texts in the Bombay papers which replicate some of its
                     narrative devices. The conceit of a found poem is echoed in ‘Hot blow the winds….’
                     (1822), an account of a soldier’s life, where the lines are prefaced by a paragraph
                     describing the circumstances of its acquisition: ‘The enclosed was picked from the <em>debris</em> of a devil of no common powers, which spread uproar and confusion through our lines
                     this forenoon. From the handwriting I suspect it to be the production of Dick Dumps
                     of ours, a very good fellow’. As in <em>The Griffin</em>, the meta-narrative comments in comedic style on the intersection of material and
                     poetic form: ‘You will perceive a <em>hiatus</em>, or hole in the ballad just before the concluding stanza, occasioned, I am sorry
                     to say, by the gnawing of a favorite terrier pup.’

                     in Bombay, as elsewhere in India, were not conducive to the persistence of local literary
                     influence. Though the <em>Bombay Gazette</em> lasted through the end of the nineteenth century, and the <em>Bombay Courier</em> until 1861, the <em>Oriental Sporting Magazine</em> lasted only five years, and other niche periodicals were similarly shortlived.

                     it is contingent upon the contribution of individuals, with brief runs of identifiable

                  <p>With the partial exception of the hunting songs, Morris’s work has remained largely
                     unread during the period of almost two hundred years since his first verses to ‘C—B—’
                     appeared in a Bombay newspaper. The ephemeral nature of the periodical press of the
                     time, and the fact that Morris (unlike many of his contemporaries) chose to eschew
                     any form of collection or book publication of his works, contributed to their neglect.
                     The nature of the texts – their focus on personal circumstances and stories, and their
                     close ties to the time and place of their composition – also make them resistant to
                     easy retrieval or decoding. They are, however, important witnesses to the literary
                     concerns and strategies of a largely overlooked British India. Morris, like his contemporary
                     writers in Bombay and the other regional centres of India, was geographically and
                     culturally distant from the main colonial literary scene of Calcutta, as well as from
                     the British centre. Separated by class as well as by education from the elite scholars
                     of the late eighteenth century, they did not have access to the transoceanic and transcultural
                     networks commanded by William Jones and his colleagues, or their knowledge of Oriental
                     languages and literatures. Culturally and professionally circumscribed by the narrow
                     society of military and sporting Bombay, the colonial literary networks developed
                     by Morris and his readers and co-writers in the <em>Oriental Sporting Magazine </em>bear no comparison to those of 1830s Calcutta, where H.L.V. Derozio, David Lester
                     Richardson, Emma Roberts, Kasiprasad Ghosh and others developed a rich, though transient,
                     set of collaborative and mutually influential cross-cultural relationships.

                     </div> Morris’s idiosyncratic vision and irreverent focus on the personal and the frivolous
                     also sets him apart from his mainstream contemporaries. Nonetheless, Morris is not
                     wholly or only a derivative writer: his repurposing of available literary models,
                     his centering of colonial lived experience and world-view, and his resourceful ability
                     to counter the preoccupations and concerns of the metropolis position him as in control
                     of, rather than dependent upon, contemporary cultural forms. His writing privileges
                     the local, the parochial and the parodic, but it also illuminates aspects of the complex
                     relationships of dependence and transformation between the metropolis, the colony
                     and the individuals whose lives and works spanned the distance between them.</p>
