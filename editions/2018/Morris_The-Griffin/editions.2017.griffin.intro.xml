          <p>The main text of this edition is a review of a hypothetical poem, ‘The Griffin’, the ‘maiden effort of an Indian Subaltern’s Muse’,
            supposedly published in an unnamed London periodical and then reproduced in the <title level="j">Bombay Gazette</title> during the autumn
            of 1820.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"> ‘From the ***** Review, Published at London by Richard Paterson, &amp; Co., 25 Long Lane,
              Third Edition – with Plates’, <title level="j">Bombay Gazette</title> 30 August 1820; further instalments appeared on 6 September, 20
              September, 25 October, 6 December and 27 December. </note> This poem, which exists only in the form of passages quoted within the
            review, is described by the reviewer as ‘written in burlesque imitation (if we may use such a phrase when the thing burlesqued is in
            itself a Burlesque) of Lord Byron’s witty yet shamelessly indecent Don Juan; void of all its richest beauties and destitute also of its
            licentiousness and depravity’.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn2" n="2">
              <title level="j">Bombay Gazette</title> 30 August 1820.</note> Serialized in six parts, the review / poem<note place="foot" resp="editors"
              xml:id="ftn3" n="3"> I use ‘The Griffin’ to refer to the embedded poem, and <title level="m">The Griffin</title> to refer to the entire
              review / poem text. </note> chronicles its protagonist’s arrival in India, his encounters with Bombay society, his experiences in the
            army and his relations with a series of women, one of whom commits herself to him and then reneges on her promises. It was the work of
            Thomas D’Arcy (or Darcy) Morris,<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn4" n="4"> The name appears in both forms. I have preferred that used by J.H.
              Stocqueler in his obituary of Morris, as Stocqueler was also the editor who published many of Morris’s works in the <title level="j"
                >Oriental Sporting Magazine</title>.</note> at the time a 28-year-old Lieutenant in the 1<hi rendition="#superscript">st</hi> Battalion of
            the 12<hi rendition="#superscript">th</hi> Regiment of the Bombay Native Infantry – the parallels between author and protagonist are more than
            situational, as Daric (the eponymous Griffin, or newcomer to India) and his lover Carineth were recognised by readers as thinly-disguised
            versions of Morris himself and Catharine Hickes, the wife of one of his friends.</p>
          <p><title level="m">The Griffin</title> is accompanied in this edition by two sets of related texts. One comprises Morris’s poems (and the
            essay ‘An Eastern Vision’) appearing in the year preceding the publication of <title level="m">The Griffin</title> in the <title level="j"
              >Bombay Gazette</title> and the <title level="j">Bombay Courier</title>, under the pseudonyms ‘M.E.’ and ‘Uxorius’. These texts are
            forerunners and in some cases proto-fragments of the longer work; they anticipate its concerns (primarily the love affair at the heart of
              <title level="m">The Griffin</title>, but also its observations of the world of Bombay), and they experiment with the characters and
            situations that would later form part of the review / poem. </p>
          <p>The other set of related texts is constituted by letters of commentary and criticism to the editors of the same newspapers, some in prose
            and some in verse, interspersed with the instalments of <title level="m">The Griffin</title> throughout the course of its publication. Two
            of these raise queries about the authenticity of ‘The Griffin’ and the identity of its author. Others contest, or appear to contest, its
            misogyny, although the tone of these communications – ‘A blush of Maiden modesty suffuses my cheeks while forming this Epistle, the first
            I ever wrote to one of the male sex’ – indicates their satiric intent.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn5" n="5"> Priscilla Wishfort to the
                <title level="j">Bombay Courier</title> (21 October 1820). </note> They are signed with a variety of pseudonyms, in keeping with
            contemporary practice, where communications for publication were by convention anonymous or pseudonymous (a correspondent who insisted on
            using his own name attracted outraged accusations of vanity from others, who pointed out that ‘writers in a newspaper, however high their
            abilities may be, in general prefer to make their public appearance in such flying sheets under a nom de guerre’).<note place="foot" resp="editors"
              xml:id="ftn6" n="6"> See the correspondence from and about J.W. Graham (<title level="j">Bombay Courier</title>, 22 and 29 September
              1821). </note> Some might conceivably be genuine inquiries from readers, such as the letter asking ‘if the author of the Poem is
            actually in England or India’, in order to ‘dispel the distrust’ prevailing among those who wondered whether the writer might be found in
            their own circles.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn7" n="7"> ‘No-Griffin’ to the <title level="j">Bombay Courier</title>, 30 September
              1820.</note> At the other extreme, the exuberant listing by ‘Slapatema Hopeful’ of her rejected suitors, together with her rejoicing in
            the prospect of another ‘<emph>thirty </emph>years to flirt about, before I am <emph>on the list</emph> of antiquated virginity’, and her
            contemptuous dismissal of ‘that superficial Griffin’, reads like a continuation outside the text of <title level="m">The Griffin</title>
            of the sex wars fought within it. Given the way in which these letters enter into and exacerbate <title level="m">The Griffin</title>’s
            themes of misogyny, conflict and satiric representation of individuals, it is very possible that some are the work of Morris himself – a
            theory borne out by his production of similar pseudonymous critical responses to his own works in the <title level="m">Oriental Sporting
              Magazine</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn8" n="8"> See the items by ‘Stephen’ included in the ‘List of works by Thomas D’Arcy
              Morris’.</note> In the absence of evidence of authorship, it might be preferable to regard at least some of them as potentially
            genuine readers’ responses to Morris’s work, indicative of his Bombay readership’s interest in and capacity for entering into the
            sophisticated literary parody sustained throughout the correspondence. </p>

          <head>The author</head>
          <p>Thomas D’Arcy Morris (1792-1835) was born in London, the eldest son of Thomas Morris, a customs official, and his wife Mary. His entire
            adult life was spent in the service of the East India Company in the Bombay army. Arriving in Bombay as a cadet in 1808, he remained there
            (with the exception of periods of leave overseas) until his death, along with two brothers, also army officers, and four sisters who
            married army officers.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn9" n="9"> ‘The Author of the “Mighty Boar”’, <title level="m">Times of India</title>
              21 October 1881, p. 2. Family historians have compiled an extensive genealogy of the Morris siblings; see http://www.asletts.com/node/7
              [23 July 2016]. </note> During his army career – where he attained the rank of captain, and worked for many years as paymaster – he is
            credited with having devised plans for a ‘retiring fund’, or pension scheme, and with being an effective advocate at courts martial, as
            well as maintaining the amateur pursuits of actor, poet, and ‘<foreign>arbiter elegentarium</foreign>’ (to quote his obituary) of his
            circle of acquaintances.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn10" n="10"> ‘The Sportsman’, <title level="j">Englishman</title>, 8 May 1835.</note>
            He was also secretary of Poona racecourse, and a sportsman renowned both for hunting and for writing popular songs in celebration of the
            hunt, his works a mainstay of the <title level="j">Oriental Sporting Magazine</title>. His death, on 13 April 1835, occurred as a

            remnants of his life and work. The exception is a letter to Mountstuart Elphinstone, Governor of Bombay 1819-1827 (the original survives
            among Elphinstone’s papers), communicating a request for preferment. Responding to the prospect of changes in the Pay Department (to which
            Elphinstone had nominated him in November 1824) which might deprive him of his post as deputy paymaster, he refers to the ‘marks of
            kindness’ already received from Elphinstone, and requests that ‘should any change in the Pay Department take place, I beg my dear sir that
            you will send me to the Deccan where the earliest &amp; happiest days of my service have been passed’.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn12"

          <p>Morris’s reference to his service in the Deccan foregrounds his personal involvement in the military actions of the early nineteenth
            century, a series of campaigns culminating in the third Anglo-Maratha war of 1817-1818. This conflict, resulting in defeat for the Maratha
            Confederacy which had controlled much of north and central India, paved the way for the consolidation of British power in the Deccan, and
            the expansion of the administrative area of the Bombay Presidency. These events underlie the personal stories of <title level="m">The
              Griffin</title> and the early poems, and their associated geographical and military landmarks also constitute a zone of mutual
            understanding between Morris and his first readers, many of whom were also participants in the East India Company’s civil and military
            establishment in Bombay. The defeat twice over of Maratha forces at the battles of Kirkee (Khadki) and Ashtee (Ashta) in late 1817,
            occasions which form the background to the second instalment of <title level="m">The Griffin</title>, was crucial to the Company’s
            achievement of control over the Deccan. The places invoked throughout the text – such as Poona (Poonah, Pune) and Sholapoor (Solapur),
            both locations where Morris had served – are part of that recently conquered territory, and demonstrate the extent to which the immediate
            history of the colony is already informing its literature. </p>

          <p>This court martial was the outcome of a series of interactions between Morris and another officer, Frederick Hickes. Morris was charged
            with ‘disgraceful conduct, unbecoming the Character of an Officer and a Gentleman’ on two counts relating to the practice of settling
            differences or avenging insults by means of a duel. In 1821, immediately following publication of the final instalment of <title level="m"
              >The Griffin</title>, he had refused to respond appropriately (presumably by issuing a challenge to fight) when Hickes insulted him with
            ‘the most opprobrious Epithets’.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn15" n="15"> ‘Court martial of Lt TD Morris of 12<hi rendition="#superscript"

            died in infancy in June 1821. If Catharine Billamore is the subject of the lines ‘To C—B—’, published by Morris in May 1819, she was at
            the time of her marriage also the subject of Morris’s attention, and may have made some kind of promise to him, which she reneged on in
            order to marry Hickes. This work points to a romantic interest – initially requited – between them, where Catharine’s repudiation of
            Morris and marriage to Hickes became the occasion of a series of self-involved narratives of love and rejection. ‘To C—B—’ reproaches its
            subject with ‘faithlessness’, and represents her as thoughtlessly abandoning the writer for another: 
         <quote><lg> <l>Till <emph>thou</emph> in woman’s fickleness of mood – </l>
          <l>Vow-pledge and every tie of faith forgetting – </l>

          <l>That heart which <emph>thou</emph> in wantonness hath broken.</l></lg></quote>
          This mode of writing – combining self-pity, fury at her betrayal and a misogynistic dwelling on the ‘fickleness’ of women – is maintained
            through several other versions of the abandoned lover’s story. An early ‘Fragment’ of what would become <title level="m">The
              Griffin</title> gives the woman in question the suggestively acronymical name of ‘Carineth’, and has the speaker, Daric (a near miss for
            ‘D’Arcy’), return from battle to find her ‘Wedded to him, my best, my bosom friend’. This situation is replicated in the prose ‘Eastern
            Vision’ where the narrator reflects on ‘the fate of many a warm hearted Youth, who relying upon the virgin-vows of some impatient female,
            obey’d the calls of Duty and Honour and returned to the object of his Adoration <emph>time enough</emph> to find her “The Bride of
              Another”!!’<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn18" n="18">

          <p>While the reiterated narrative is a striking feature when these texts are read together, they were first published as incidental pieces
            of no particular note, and appear to have attracted no attention. This changed with the publication of <title level="m">The

            re-enacting the scene of parting from Daric as a prelude to entering ‘the pale of matrimony “almost unsought and totally unwoo’d”’, it is
            in the context of a work which all but proclaims its status as roman à clef: ‘the objects thus satirized may <emph>possibly</emph> be the
            mere creatures of [the poet’s] imagination but to us they appear to issue so fresh in feature and with such undoubted impress of real Life

            mind. On his return to Bombay in July 1823, he resumed hostilities with Hickes, this time as the aggressor, sending a message intended ‘to
            provoke … Hickes to fight a Duel on grounds connected with the … circumstances’ of January 1821, and eventually bringing about the
            court-martial. The fact that the court acquitted him of all charges, to the dismay of the commander in chief who pointed out that the

          <head> ‘It was his own life…’</head>
          <p>Over sixty years after the events described in <title level="m">The Griffin</title>, a correspondent of the <title level="j">Times of
              India</title> wrote to claim that he had been acquainted with Morris, a friend of his father’s, ‘in my youth, now alas about fifty years
            ago’. This letter correctly identifies Morris as the author of hunting songs, but its references to <title level="m">The Griffin</title>
            are inaccurate – the text is cited as ‘Life of Tom Raw the Griffin’<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn26" n="26">
              <title level="m">Tom Raw, the Griffin</title>, by a Civilian and an Officer on the Bengal Establishment [Charles D’Oyly and James
              Atkinson] (London: Ackermann, 1828). A later correspondent contests the association of Morris with <title level="m">Tom Raw: The
                Griffin</title>, and raises the alternative possibility that he might be the author of <title level="m">The Grand Master: or,
                Adventures of Qui Hi in Hindustan</title>, by ‘Quiz’ (1816) (A.C., ‘Tom Raw, the Griffin’, <title level="j">Times of India</title> 24
              October 1881, p. 2). This is at least theoretically possible – Morris in 1816 had been eight years in India – but it does not seem
              likely that the author would have produced first the sustained narrative and technical achievement of <title level="m">The Grand
                Master</title> (and had the resources to have it published in London, with Rowlandson’s engravings) and only then the short and
              repetitive poems and fragmentary narrative forms that make up <title level="m">The Griffin</title> and its forerunners.</note>
            (confusing it with the far more widely read later poem of that name) – and attributes its publication to the <title level="j"
              >Courier</title> rather than the <title level="j">Gazette</title>. The writer continues: ‘It was his <emph>own</emph> life on first
            arrival in the country. He was engaged to a young lady, a very handsome one; however, there was a disagreement, and he got soured and
            wrote this work, and it was privately circulated amongst his personal friends.’<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn27" n="27"> Budha Admin, ‘To
              the editor of the <title level="j">Times of India</title>’, <emph>Times of India</emph>, 15 October 1881, p. 6. </note> The
            inconsistencies of this account, and the time elapsed between the events described and the correspondent’s recollection, are reasons to
            treat the rationale offered with caution – but the reference to an engagement perhaps merely formalizes the abandoned promise which
            underlies the early poems, the focus for the writer’s fury and despair. </p>
          <p>These early works turn in each case on a scene of trauma and betrayal experienced by a protagonist who returns from battle to find that
            his promised beloved has married his friend. The ‘warm hearted Youth’ of ‘An Eastern Vision’ finds ‘the object of his Adoration’ has
            become ‘The Bride of Another’; the addressee of ‘To C—.B—.’ has ‘Leapt to <emph>another’s</emph> arms’; the Carineth of ‘A Fragment’ is
            ‘Wedded to him, my best, my bosom friend’, and so on. The explanation for her conduct is variously given as ‘woman’s fickleness’,
            faithlessness, impatience – the qualities of what ‘Observer XIV’ terms a ‘<emph>true woman</emph>’. The overriding point is clearly about
            the infidelity of women, and the impact of this particular woman’s betrayal of the man who loved her. </p>
          <p>In <title level="m">The Griffin</title>, a more complicated story is alluded to. The reviewer’s remarks on Canto 4 suggest that the
            reason for the breakdown of relations between Carineth and Daric appears to be on his side, rather than hers – ‘he had found means to
            communicate to her that an invincible obstacle prevented their Union’ – and are thus at odds with the version offered in the earlier
            fragments, where Daric is represented as overcome by her decision to send him away. In Canto 6, a different version again: ‘Soon after the
            rupture between Babille and the Griffin, Carineth, who had watched the progress of the Amour, now treats him with marked reserve and
            almost merited Contempt’. She eventually rejects him, leaving him ‘to wander thro’ the world the victim of a hopeless passion – a prey to
            miserable and vain regret whilst the object of his affections, enters the pale of matrimony “almost unsought and totally unwoo’d.”’ Here,
            unlike any of the earlier versions, the woman’s point of view is given, and given in direct speech: 
          <quote><lg><l>…’twould now be weak to rail</l>
          <l>Or sigh for one, who would that sigh deride</l>
          <l>Who, by the hour of parting, moan, and wail</l>
          <l>Flew to <emph>another</emph> shrine and knelt and sighed </l>
          <l>And woo’d a face of Smiles … (Canto 6, ll. 183-187).</l>
          </lg></quote>
           These variations of the story, with their movement away from the basic theme of Carineth’s faithlessness, might be attributable to a
            changing mood of the writer, or to the narrative complexity inherent in the longer form of the review / poem, where multiple characters
            and episodes complicate the spare landscape of the earlier texts. Nonetheless, the attitude to women more generally expressed by the
            writer remains constant, as the more nuanced representation of Carineth is accompanied by the deployment of the freakishly untrustworthy
            ‘woman-Serpent’ Babille, false from her hair and her teeth to her ‘flirting, fibbing, scandal and back biting’ (Canto 6, ll. 135-142). As
            this, rather than the plight of the abandoned lover, strikes the key-note of <title level="m">The Griffin</title>, it suggests that the
            writer was left with a lasting contempt for his female compatriots. </p>
          <p>Morris’s later work bears this out, as it concerns almost exclusively the masculine world of sport – hunting, horse-racing – and avoids
            any engagement with his former subjects. A hunting poem, ‘Saddle, Spur and Spear’, chronicles the transition in words which all but compel
            a biographical reading: 
          <quote><lg><l>Let others boast and proudly toast</l>
          <l>The light of ladies’ eyes,</l>

        <div type="section">
          <head><title level="m">The Griffin</title>’s ‘Anti-woman Mania’</head>
          <p>One of the most striking aspects of Morris’s work is its misogyny, which finds expression in three ways. First is the resentful depiction
            of women as status-seeking and faithless, summed up in the embedded poem of ‘The Observer XIV’: the female protagonist is said to value
            ‘Rank’ in a prospective partner over the quality of a ‘warm’ heart. Her decision to cast aside her lover and marry his friend is
            represented as a trait of the female sex more generally, rather than indicative of her personal characteristics: the action of a
              ‘<emph>true woman</emph>’. Second, the material bodies of women are represented as grotesque and revolting to men, as the apparent
            allure of Babille, for instance, turns out to conceal a combination of physical repulsiveness and artificial enhancements: 
          <quote><lg><l>Her bloom, hair teeth and neck, struck Daric’s senses,</l>
          <l>But soon the youth recover’d, from the shock</l>
          <l>For he found out (<emph>how</emph> I’lle not say – but hence his</l>
          <l>Disgust) they were at bed-time under lock</l>
          <l>And key – with <emph>all </emph>her little prominences!! (<title level="m">The Griffin</title>, Canto 6, ll. 143-147). </l></lg></quote>
          Third, the text continually returns to a repetitive trope of entrapment, dwelling on figures such as the ‘dame well-skilled in
            husband-seeking’ who ‘by some artful and expert manoeuvre / … lures a gilded gudgeon to the Bait’ (Canto 6, l. 250); or Vivian, who uses
            the spell given her by Merlin to trap him (Canto 6, 115-130). ‘Man is their prey’, the implied poet of ‘The Griffin’ writes (Canto 6, l.
            48). The reviewer, for his part, seemingly contests the misogyny of the poem’s text by highlighting ‘the most unpardonable language in
            which the Author has attempted to degrade the loveliest part of Creation’. This strategy frames and draws attention to exactly the theme
            it appears to decry, and the brief mention of supportive and beloved ‘Women (and particularly British Women)’ is overshadowed by the
            account of those ‘females even in India whose turpitude of conduct render them objects of loathing and disgust to every virtuous mind’
            (Canto 1). When Daric’s encounter with Marion, his ‘<emph>proper </emph>Love’, is mentioned by the reviewer, it is simultaneously elided:
            ‘Her appearance is most interestingly described, her character exquisitely pourtrayed, the opening of his passion and her confession
            together with their extraordinary adventures and final disappointment, separation and misery, form one of the most pathetic Episodes we
            have ever read.’ But, the reviewer continues, ‘We will not anticipate the readers delight which this affecting tale will impart...’ (Canto
            3). The present, but invisible, phantom of the ‘proper’ woman is contrasted with the all-too-concretely imagined versions of the improper
            feminine: Babille the ‘Talking shuttle cock’, Pamela with her ‘carrion’ breath and addiction to ‘lying and to liquor’.<note place="foot" resp="editors"

          <p>Some of this attitude will inevitably be attributed to the personal circumstances of the writer, and the obsessively repeated depiction

            mistrust of women is more widely visible across the periodicals of colonial Bombay. As <title level="m">The Griffin</title> was being
            published in the <title level="j">Bombay Gazette</title>, another poem in the rival <title level="j">Courier </title>remarked on the
            immodesty of women (‘nature’s self is frail’, and ‘I’d have maids vestals – till they’re brides’); and the same writer later evokes the
            spectre of a woman’s corrupt body: ‘the flush of beauty’s face / Hiding disease – by adding grace.’<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn30"

            theme of entrapment in Morris’s work is echoed in the notion of the freedom of bachelorhood being curtailed by ‘Wedlock’s mystic chain’, a

          <p>Such representations of women and relationships should be viewed in the context of a colonial society based on the civil and military
            structures of the East India Company, where pay increased only with seniority, leaving junior officers without independent means in often
            straitened circumstances. (On attaining the rank of major in 1834, Morris was paid nearly three times the amount he received as a
            lieutenant in 1820, but he had by then been in the Company’s service for twenty-five years.) Simultaneously, the gender imbalance in the
            makeup of that society – the ‘great number of men’, as Maria Graham puts it, in relation to a small number of women – underlies the sexual
            politics of colonial Bombay.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn33" n="33"> Maria Graham, <title level="m">Journal of a Residence in

            gaze, but rendered invisible. In response to female sexual agency, the poem resorts to the production of femininity as the embodiment and

          <p>The sensational story at the heart of <title level="m">The Griffin</title> should not become a distraction from the larger context for
            Morris’s work. The poem is not just about the protagonist, or about Bombay society; it is also a writing back to the literary
            establishment of Britain. This is represented by the supposed reviewer of ‘The Griffin’, whose ignorance of the social and linguistic
            norms of colonial society is established from the outset. Led by the title to expect a ‘tale of German Horrors, a tissue of deaths heads
            and blue lights’, rather than the account of a novice traveller to India, he maintains throughout the review a stance of distaste for the
            world of Bombay, commenting upon the ‘disgusting minuteness’ with which the poem describes the inhabitants of the country.<note

              <title level="m">The Griffin</title>, Canto 1, Canto 2. </note> Hampered by his lack of knowledge and attitude of disdain, this reviewer
            is held up to ridicule by an author who invites his readers to re-evaluate their own accustomed position of distance from and dependence
            on the metropolis. Rather than finding themselves literally and figuratively at the end of a line, waiting months for the supply of ideas,
            texts and cultural forms to travel from Britain to Bombay, colonial readers are invited to enjoy a position of relative advantage. When
            the reviewer remarks that ‘the description of [the dawn breaking] appears one of the Author’s best specimens of Eastern scenery, but we
            leave the greatest portion of it out, that it may reach with all the additional effect of novelty, those who may have witnessed and can
            better appreciate the local interest’ (Canto 2), he is identifying local readers as privileged – those who can ‘appreciate’ the text – but
            also underlining the imagined metropolitan reader’s lack of access to the sights and events of the colony. </p>
          <p>The reviewer’s other function is to signpost the text’s operation as a roman à clef, where not only the two protagonists, but also some
            of the incidental characters, are recognizable portraits of individuals. This level of coding is generally inaccessible now, as the time
            elapsed since publication renders indecipherable the highly-coloured depictions of characters such as Pomponious the surveyor, Babille, or
            the gruesome married couple Janet and Peter. It is nonetheless clear that episodes such as the Griffin’s encounter with ‘a friend of his
            father’s’, whose ungenerous refusal of notice or hospitality is a dismaying introduction to Bombay, are to be read, contra the reviewer’s
            sarcastic protests, as real-life representations: ‘the outline of this personage is greatly overdrawn and we trust that no one sat for the

            of the picturesque familiar to readers of travel-writing and poetry from India, but it is mixed with the listing of place-names and
            landmarks familiar only to local residents, setting lived experience of India in tension with the metropolitan-facing consumerist vision

            Heathenish names of Parbuttee, Gunness-Kund, Singhur and Paishaunee’, highlights their strangeness to a metropolitan eye, but to local
            readers, these are regional landmarks, familiar as locations associated with the battle of Kirkee and the wider campaign by which the East
            India Company attained control over the Deccan territories. Colonial readers’ acquaintance with these temporally, politically and
            geographically specific locations sets them both apart from and (in terms of knowledge and cultural capital) above their counterparts of
            the metropolis. Similarly, the scene before the battle of Kirkee, in Canto 2 of <title level="m">The Griffin</title>, acknowledges a
            moment of colonial dependence on the metropolis in Morris’s open imitation of Byron’s <title level="m">Childe Harold</title>, but the
            battle also signals for the readers of Bombay their own assertion of dominance in India, chronicled in a text prioritising the agenda of
            the colony. In this way, Morris reverses the polarity of some of the basic literary and political relationships of the Romantic period,
            contesting the increasingly hegemonic role of publications such as the <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title> in policing the
            boundaries of literature, and engaging in the creative appropriation of metropolitan literary forms to give voice to specifically colonial
            and anti-metropolitan concerns. </p>

          <p>Morris was a wide reader with an excellent knowledge of poetry and fiction, as well as a magpie eclecticism and a confident willingness
            to adapt – he was happy, for example, to take one line of Walter Scott’s on a mythological hero’s death from a review of Southey’s work,
            and transform the dying message to a beloved wife into a declaration of love for someone who has just been discovered to be the wife of
            someone else.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn38" n="38"> See ‘’Twas Noon’, note 4. Morris’s inexact references suggest a practice of relying
              on memory: his quotation of John Campbell, for example, substitutes ‘glitter’d’ for ‘shone’ and ‘people’ for ‘other animals’ (Canto 6,
              note 145).</note> Similarly, the epigraph from Scott’s <title level="m">Legend of Montrose </title>that precedes the full text of ‘An
            Eastern Vision’ (not given here) is adapted to be voiced by a man in relation to a woman, rather than the original where the reverse is
            the case: ‘But parted by severe decree, / Far different must our fortunes prove, / May thine be Joy – enough for me, / To weep and pray
            for her I love.’<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn39" n="39"> Compare Walter Scott, <title level="m">A Legend of the Wars of Montrose</title>,

            invocation of John Suckling in the correspondence, the literary network evolved by Morris (whether regarded as his own work or achieved in
            partnership with his readers) stretches back to the seventeenth century.</p>
          <p>The most significant link in that network of connection between metropolis and colony, Byron, and especially his best-known work, <title

            opening lines, and the romantic escapades of its protagonist, ensure that the latter forms the lens through which its first readers saw

                <title level="j">Don Juan</title> published in the <title level="j">Bombay Gazette</title> issues of 26 April and 3 May 1820, copied

              Byron’s life. Notwithstanding its inauthenticity, it further demonstrates the local interest in Byron’s work, and the availability of
              the Byronic hero as a model for colonial writers. </note>
          </p>
          <p>In some respects, the appearance of <title level="m">The Griffin</title> fits well into this narrative of Byronic originary force. Morris
            had been publishing short works exploring the bitter aftermath of rejection in the years immediately preceding the publication of <title
              level="m">Don Juan</title>, producing a repetitive series of lyric verses focusing on the protagonist’s emotional response to his
            lover’s betrayal. The series of fragments hints at a larger narrative, but none such is forthcoming. The arrival in India of <title
              level="m">Don Juan</title> Cantos I and II might be regarded as a turning-point: in August 1820, the first canto of <title level="m">The
              Griffin</title> makes its appearance, complete with a Byronic protagonist, a narrative of that protagonist’s progress through Bombay
            society, and a narrative voice and style which consciously and deliberately echoes Byron’s <foreign>ottava rima</foreign>, his tone and
            his flamboyant rhymes. The acknowledgement of <title level="m">Don Juan</title> in the opening paragraph is all but superfluous.</p>
          <p>To read <title level="m">Don Juan</title> as a determining force in relation to <title level="m">The Griffin</title> is, however, to
            overlook several important aspects of the work and its composition. Morris’s fictional construct, with its series of embedded narrative
            structures, the inbuilt commentary of the review element, and the (probable) accompaniment of the readers’ chorus of the correspondence,
            draws on a wider and older tradition than that represented simply by Byron’s work. The device of a long narrative poem with prose
            interludes had been popularized by Thomas Moore’s <title level="m">Lalla Rookh</title>, invoked by Morris in <title level="m">The
              Griffin</title> (Canto 5). Samuel Richardson’s multi-vocal epistolary novels, with their insistence on deferral of readerly judgement,
            are invoked in both poem and correspondence, enabling Morris to frame the self-centred lyric lines about Daric’s plight within a construct
            of distancing and sceptical narrative.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn43" n="43"> Richardson’s heroine Pamela is called into readerly memory

              by the correspondence (see the letter of ‘Anna Howe’ in this edition). </note> The use of the review article format echoes the
            centrality of reviews to the process of reading and reception of the early nineteenth century, at a time when the <title level="j"
              >Edinburgh Review</title> was reaching a circulation of 13,000, and (as Morris’s own reading of Southey through Walter Scott’s review
            suggests) providing a window onto contemporary literature for more readers than would encounter the original works.<note place="foot" resp="editors"

          <head>Morris and the evolution of a colonial literary tradition</head>
          <p>In the moment of 1820, <title level="m">The Griffin</title> caught the attention of Bombay, and Morris continued to be sought after as a
            poet and comic essayist, dominating the columns of the <title level="j">Oriental Sporting Magazine</title> (1828-1833) over the course of
            its publication.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn45" n="45"> See the list of ‘Additional Works’; even before the advent of the
                <emph>OSM</emph>, the unusual response from the editor of the <title level="j">Bombay Gazette</title> to the submission of ‘An Eastern
              Vision’ – a note that future contributions ‘will be always acceptable’ (5 April 1820) – suggests that Morris’s work was valued above
              that of other contributors.</note> Its longer term influence, and especially the extent to which it might be said to contribute to a
            distinctively colonial literary tradition, is more open to question. It may be helpful here to distinguish between the formal aspects of
            Morris’s work – the playful, multivocal texts where content is nuanced through layers of narrative – and the subject-matter, particularly
            as that pertains to the concerns and lived experience of British residents in India. On this latter point, there is evidence in the
            periodical record to suggest that Morris’s work, particularly the sporting texts of the <title level="j">Oriental Sporting
              Magazine</title>, came to exemplify for readers a golden age of Britain in India, or at least a golden age for British officers of the
            East India Company, who enjoyed a degree of freedom, autonomy and leisure to follow their own pursuits unattainable for their successors.
            This is the message of a writer for the <title level="j">Times of India</title> in the 1890s, who sums up his nostalgic retrospective in
            the remark that ‘There were more hogs in these days’.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn46" n="46"> ‘Sport and Song in the Bombay Presidency,

            another Bombay writer, ‘Ram Bux’, exemplifies the alienation felt by British colonizers in the light of a nascent Indian movement towards

          <p>On literary form, the legacy of Morris’s work is less visible. There are some traces observable in the years following publication of
              <title level="m">The Griffin</title>, in the appearance of other texts in the Bombay papers which replicate some of its narrative
            devices. The conceit of a found poem is echoed in ‘Hot blow the winds….’ (1822), an account of a soldier’s life, where the lines are
            prefaced by a paragraph describing the circumstances of its acquisition: ‘The enclosed was picked from the <emph>debris</emph> of a devil
            of no common powers, which spread uproar and confusion through our lines this forenoon. From the handwriting I suspect it to be the
            production of Dick Dumps of ours, a very good fellow’. As in <title level="m">The Griffin</title>, the meta-narrative comments in comedic
            style on the intersection of material and poetic form: ‘You will perceive a <emph>hiatus</emph>, or hole in the ballad just before the
            concluding stanza, occasioned, I am sorry to say, by the gnawing of a favorite terrier pup.’<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn50" n="50">

            the pseudonymous ‘Amicus’ in ‘Trip to Margate; or, A Peep at Ladies as They Are’.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn51" n="51">
              <title level="j">Bombay Gazette</title>, 16 January, 23 January 1822.</note> The <title level="j">Oriental Sporting Magazine</title>
            carried several examples of texts using narrative framing, the deployment of multiple authorial personae and embedded controversies; as
            well as longer works such as ‘The Three Macs’, by ‘Andropais’, drawing on <title level="m">The Griffin</title>’s Byronic format and the
            trope of the encounter with Bombay.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn52" n="52"> ‘The Three Macs’ was serialized over several issues (<title
                level="j">Oriental Sporting Magazine </title>1.158-161, 1.232-236, 1.361-363); see also ‘The Griffin’s First Picnic’, by Peter Popjoy
                (<title level="j">Oriental Sporting Magazine </title>2. 278-380); and one of Morris’s own works, ‘John Dockery Again’: ‘The
              accompanying M.S. was accidentally discovered in the tavern at Khandalla, and is supposed to have escaped from John’s breeches pocket
              while he was yet under the influence of the powerful narcotic administered by Nimrod in the East.’ (<title level="j">Oriental Sporting
                Magazine</title> 2.227). The inclusion of a reference to ‘Nimrod in the East’ – another <emph>OSM</emph> correspondent – recalls the
              coterie element of <title level="m">The Griffin</title> and its associated correspondence.</note>
          </p>
          <p>Despite these early signs of an evolving literary tradition, the conditions of publication in Bombay, as elsewhere in India, were not
            conducive to the persistence of local literary influence. Though the <title level="j">Bombay Gazette</title> lasted through the end of the
            nineteenth century, and the <title level="j">Bombay Courier</title> until 1861, the <title level="j">Oriental Sporting Magazine</title>
            lasted only five years, and other niche periodicals were similarly shortlived.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn53" n="53"> Examples include
              the <title level="j">Bombay Iris</title> (1827), the <title level="j">Bombay Gentlemen’s Literary Gazette</title> (1843-1849), and the
                <title level="j">Bombay Oriental News</title> (1853-1857). </note> Looking across the span of the nineteenth century, it is evident
            that even where individual titles persist, the presence of poetry in the periodicals, and the incidence of particular genres and modes of
            poetry, is not consistent across titles or across time; rather it is contingent upon the contribution of individuals, with brief runs of
            identifiable work lasting sometimes a year or two and then fading as the authors died, were transferred, or lost interest.<note
              place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn54" n="54"> In the <title level="j">Bombay Oriental News</title>, for example, the poetry columns for 1853 are
              largely filled by the contributions of two authors, W.A. Shepherd of Colaba and the pseudonymous ‘Ada’. By the following year, ‘Ada’ is
              seen no longer, and Shepherd’s contributions cease in June 1854, after which the volume of poetry in the periodical dwindles to
              insignificant proportions until 1857. </note> Though <title level="m">The Griffin</title> continued to be fondly, if inaccurately,
            recollected (see above), the ephemerality of local print culture, and the weight of metropolitan literature which continued to be
            preferred in the colonial marketplace, militated against any more lasting impact Morris’s work might have had on the literary tradition of
              Bombay.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn55" n="55"> The relative value of metropolitan versus local literature is demonstrated by the
              editor of the <title level="j">Bombay Courier</title>, whose note to correspondents explains that the contributions of a local author,
              ‘Senrub’, have been ‘laid aside to make room for our English files. When they are exhausted we will return to … his verses’ (2 May
              1829). </note>
          </p>
          <p>With the partial exception of the hunting songs, Morris’s work has remained largely unread during the period of almost two hundred years
            since his first verses to ‘C—B—’ appeared in a Bombay newspaper. The ephemeral nature of the periodical press of the time, and the fact
            that Morris (unlike many of his contemporaries) chose to eschew any form of collection or book publication of his works, contributed to
            their neglect. The nature of the texts – their focus on personal circumstances and stories, and their close ties to the time and place of
            their composition – also make them resistant to easy retrieval or decoding. They are, however, important witnesses to the literary
            concerns and strategies of a largely overlooked British India. Morris, like his contemporary writers in Bombay and the other regional
            centres of India, was geographically and culturally distant from the main colonial literary scene of Calcutta, as well as from the British
            centre. Separated by class as well as by education from the elite scholars of the late eighteenth century, they did not have access to the
            transoceanic and transcultural networks commanded by William Jones and his colleagues, or their knowledge of Oriental languages and
            literatures. Culturally and professionally circumscribed by the narrow society of military and sporting Bombay, the colonial literary
            networks developed by Morris and his readers and co-writers in the <title level="j">Oriental Sporting Magazine </title>bear no comparison
            to those of 1830s Calcutta, where H.L.V. Derozio, David Lester Richardson, Emma Roberts, Kasiprasad Ghosh and others developed a rich,
            though transient, set of collaborative and mutually influential cross-cultural relationships.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn56" n="56">
              These relationships are discussed in Gibson, <title level="m">Indian Angles</title>; Rosinka Chaudhuri, <title level="m">Gentlemen Poets
                in Colonial Bengal: Emergent Nationalism and the Orientalist Project</title> (Calcutta: Seagull, 2002). </note> Morris’s idiosyncratic
            vision and irreverent focus on the personal and the frivolous also sets him apart from his mainstream contemporaries. Nonetheless, Morris
            is not wholly or only a derivative writer: his repurposing of available literary models, his centering of colonial lived experience and
            world-view, and his resourceful ability to counter the preoccupations and concerns of the metropolis position him as in control of, rather
            than dependent upon, contemporary cultural forms. His writing privileges the local, the parochial and the parodic, but it also illuminates
            aspects of the complex relationships of dependence and transformation between the metropolis, the colony and the individuals whose lives
            and works spanned the distance between them. </p>
