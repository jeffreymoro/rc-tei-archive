                     A lecture from your pen might prove of service to them, by shewing their ill-natured
                     propensity in its true light. I am a married man, and, since my arrival in India,
                     I have seldom mixed in society without having my mind put into a state of irritability
                     from the unvaried and constant allusion to the <em>horrors</em> of <em>Wedlock</em>, which is ever reviled as a state of strife and bondage. You must, I am sure, be
                     well aware of the happiness and respectability of a married life, and will, I trust,
                     point out the ill-nature, aye, and the ill-breeding of making it a handle for pointed
                     ridicule and execrable puns at the expence of other people’s feelings. Matrimony,
                     I know, has ever been a subject for the smart sayings and “devilish good things” of
                     the witlings of the age. No wonder then, that these <em>Scoffers at Love</em>, when they change their minds (for they all do, or <em>long</em> to do so) should, upon <em>experience</em>, after so many repartees and <em>jests</em> find <em>Matrimony no Joke!!</em></p>
                  <div class="wrapper">
                     <p>The following lines were dropped by one of these <em>“Bachelors for Ever</em>” whilst the <em>Exquisite</em> was taking from his coat-pocket his “<span class="smallcaps">Book of Steps</span>” for the Quadrille he was practising. Though written with feeling, there breathes
                        throughout such a spirit of hatred and rancour, that, I trust, with some animadversions
                        from your pen, they will defeat their own end. They evidently formed part of some
                        longer Poem, and I beg you will give them speedy publicity.

               newly married wife. Hickes, a fellow officer of Morris’s, was to quarrel with him

         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">Columns headed ‘The Observer’ and signed by ‘J.’ appear occasionally in the <em>Bombay Gazette </em>in 1818-1819: a full list is given in the Bibliography. While the first seems to be
               a serious discussion of religious faith among the British in India, the column quickly
               took on a knowing tone and a satiric approach to subjects including the Bombay theatre
               (IX and XI), the qualities required for success in India (VI, XIII), the means necessary
               for those returning to Britain to live adequately (III, V), ladies’ fashions (IV),
               and letters from correspondents speculating on the identity and circumstances of the
               ‘Observer’ himself. Numbers IV and X are of particular interest in the context of
               <em>The Griffin</em>’s anti-feminism, as both introduce letters from supposed female correspondents preoccupied
               with appearance and with the prospect of a lucrative marriage. Eliza Scanty comes
               out to India ‘with an entire new Wardrobe of the latest fashions’, thinking ‘of nothing
               else on the voyage but the pleasure of exhibiting my person (which by the bye I think
               a very tolerable one) to the greatest advantage’; and targets the ‘Observer’ with
               flirtatious remarks: ‘I am sure you are a Civilian, and I would lay a bet you are
               young and handsome’ (IV). The letter from ‘Curvilia’ reinforces <em>The Griffin</em>’s focus on sexualized female bodies: ‘I have been three years in India, and when
               I first arrived, what with tight lacing, the stocks, and the backboard I landed as
               upright as possible. Though I had lots of fishes at my hook, and plenty of nibbles,
               yet my erect manner gained me but one bite and that was from an elderly <em>Cadet </em>whom I civilly rejected[.] The Civilians said I was as stiff as a poker, and the military
               swore I had swallowed a ramrod, how vulgar! I was rather pretty, rather genteel, rather
               accomplished and rather amiable, yet still somehow I was rather single, and time threatened
               to leave me withering on the Virgin thorn, but taking example from several Girls,
               who by greater pliability of back and greater exposure to <em>squinting eyes</em> &amp; <em>nightly colds</em>, most surprisingly soon enjoyed the sweets of wedlock. I resolved to <em>bend</em> to circumstances and shall still continue in spite of Mr. Observer, or his Dandy
               friend “to stoop to Conquer”’ (X).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               ‘And now Laogh, when thou seest Eirir [sic], tell her that my affection never hath
               strayed from her, that through my whole life I have loved her alone, nor ever saw
