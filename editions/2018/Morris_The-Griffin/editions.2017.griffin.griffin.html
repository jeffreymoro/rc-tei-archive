                  <div class="wrapper">
                     <p>The Work which we are about to review is reported to be the maiden effort of an Indian
                        Subaltern’s Muse, written during the many hours of Solitude and Idleness incident
                        to a Soldier’s life, and under the depression of much mental affliction. We did not
                        therefore look for much erudition – indeed the nature of the Work precluded such a
                        hope – but we expected much amusement, some novelty and some faults, nor have our
                        critical expectations been disappointed, for we found many laughable anecdotes, many
                        new scenes and situations and many errors. It is written in burlesque imitation (if
                        we may use such a phrase when the thing burlesqued is in itself a Burlesque) of Lord
                        Byron’s witty yet shamelessly indecent Don Juan; void of all its richest beauties
                        and destitute also of its licentiousness and depravity. It purposes to relate the
                        life and adventures of a youth sent out to India as a Cadet for the Infantry. We had
                        seated ourselves by a comfortable fire-side, drawn close the window curtains and “while
                        the Bubbling and loud hissing Urn sent up its steamy column,” prepared ourselves for
                        judgment on “The Griffin.”

                        ushered into the world, and in some vexation of spirit, looked for a tale of German
                        Horrors, a tissue of deaths heads and blue lights, groans and hollow voices, worms
                        creeping in and worms creeping out, bleeding ghosts, seven-feet monks, gore-stained
                        daggers and bowls of poison, but from this apprehension we were relieved by an old

                  <p class="noCount">Upon a production of the nature now before us, we would willingly be as little severe
                     as our imperative duty to our Readers will permit, and though the lash might often
                     have been bestowed, for the most palpable carelessness and want of reflection, we
                     would have spared the rod altogether had we not been shocked by the most ridiculous
                     anachronisms; in some places and the most servile imitation, in others, the want of
                     unity thro’ out, and above all by the most unpardonable language in which the Author
                     has attempted to degrade the loveliest part of Creation. That he has written these
                     calumnies from the heart we cannot believe, and while we render this justice to his
                     better feelings, we would warn him of his want of common benevolence, and pity the
                     disposition that could be so palpable, so miserably prejudiced by the impulse of the
                     moment. That there are some females even in India whose turpitude of conduct render
                     them objects of loathing and disgust to every virtuous mind, we are not prepared to
                     deny – but in the general Women (and particularly British Women) whether shivering
                     in the Icy regions of the North or wasting their bloom in the land of the Sun, whether
                     floating on the sea of affluence or stemming the rude tide of poverty, in the zenith
                     of joy, or in the day of agony, in the pomp of Vigor, or in the hour of Death, twine
                     round the stubborn heart of “Lordly Man,” the object of his purest passions, the sharers
                     of his prosperity and distress, the partakers of his joy and his pain, rendering his
                     toils a pleasure, his life a blessing and his home a Heaven!! We trust our readers
                     will forgive us for thus trespassing the honest burst of our feelings upon their patience,
                     but we are sure that every one who peruses that portion of the book we allude to,
                     will join with us in condemning the acrimony which the Author has so wantonly evinced
                     towards those whom he should have considered it his duty to have treated with kindness
                     and his pride to have protected from insult. We trust this lecture will shew him the
                     cruelty and malevolence of his conduct and should it awake in him those pangs of remorse
                     which lead to reparation we shall not reget the trouble we have now taken “to probe
                     and cure the Canker in his heart.” In the hope that such may be the effect of our
                     animadversions we now proceed to the more pleasing part of our duty, that of bestowing
                     praise, and in doing this, we will give our readers an outline of the story and occasional
                     extracts that has struck us as deserving of approbation. The Poem commences with the

                  to make one more attempt, and in this one he is rewarded for all his trouble. The
                  worthy person to whom he now introduces himself receives him in the most kind and
                  friendly manner makes him an inmate in his happy family, consisting of his wife, her
                  married sister and two children. As we are coming to the most interesting part of
                  the Griffin’s life, his first <em>love fit</em>; and as the end of the Canto fast approaches, the Author says, speaking of “the Griffin.”</p>

                  writes an account of <em>it</em> and his feelings on the occasion to his friends, and here the Poet has made a sad
                  jumble of the ideas that <em>then</em> pressed upon his mind and his <em>subsequent</em> reflections, for while he is scribbling to his relatives about the Action he tells
                  them that it is Early Day and that his “favorite Planet is alone shining upon” him,
                  and <em>then</em> likens it to the “false Beacon” that <em>ultimately</em> deluded him, this is one of the many inadvertencies with which the Poem abounds,
                  but his lines on the occasion are forcible, and deserve approbation. Alluding to the
                  Morning Star “shining singly in the dark vault of heaven” and growing “paler and yet

                  by which it is conveyed. The other and only sonnet for which we can now afford room
                  is a beautiful thing. We know not how any one could have written with such feeling
                  and force without having experienced the agony it depicts, it looks too much like
                  reality, too like the disappointment of Juvenile passion, for fiction, and appears
                  to have been composed while the heart was actually, bleeding from the effects of the
                  scene described. In an unguarded moment Carineth (who is the Lady in question) had
                  consented to an interview with the Griffin when all the family had retired to rest.
                  The day proceeding, he had found means to communicate to her that an invincible obstacle
                  prevented their Union, but its nature is not very clear it leads however to their
                  separation immediately after this midnight assignation, the issue of which we are
                  obliged to guess at, from this beautiful delineation of early impressions.</p>
