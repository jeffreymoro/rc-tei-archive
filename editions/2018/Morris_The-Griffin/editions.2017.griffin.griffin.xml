          <p rend="noCount"><hi rendition="#smallcaps">From the</hi> ***** <hi rendition="#smallcaps">Review</hi>. <emph>Published at London by</emph>
            <hi rendition="#smallcaps">Richard Paterson</hi>, &amp; Co. 25 <emph>Long Lane</emph>, <hi rendition="#smallcaps">Third Edition</hi>. –
              <emph>with Plates</emph>.</p>
          <p rend="noCount">The Work which we are about to review is reported to be the maiden effort of an Indian Subaltern’s Muse, written during
            the many hours of Solitude and Idleness incident to a Soldier’s life, and under the depression of much mental affliction. We did not
            therefore look for much erudition – indeed the nature of the Work precluded such a hope – but we expected much amusement, some novelty and
            some faults, nor have our critical expectations been disappointed, for we found many laughable anecdotes, many new scenes and situations
            and many errors. It is written in burlesque imitation (if we may use such a phrase when the thing burlesqued is in itself a Burlesque) of
            Lord Byron’s witty yet shamelessly indecent Don Juan; void of all its richest beauties and destitute also of its licentiousness and
            depravity. It purposes to relate the life and adventures of a youth sent out to India as a Cadet for the Infantry. We had seated ourselves
            by a comfortable fire-side, drawn close the window curtains and “while the Bubbling and loud hissing Urn sent up its steamy column,”
            prepared ourselves for judgment on “The Griffin.”<note place="foot" resp="editors" > An imperfect recollection of
              Cowper’s ‘The Winter Evening’: ‘And while the bubbling and loud-hissing urn / Throws up a steamy column’ (William Cowper, <title
                level="m">The Task: A Poem in Six Books</title> (London, 1785), p. 139). </note> We confess we were somewhat startled at the
            horrifying title under which it has been ushered into the world, and in some vexation of spirit, looked for a tale of German Horrors, a
            tissue of deaths heads and blue lights, groans and hollow voices, worms creeping in and worms creeping out, bleeding ghosts, seven-feet
            monks, gore-stained daggers and bowls of poison, but from this apprehension we were relieved by an old Indian Friend and Co-Critic, who
            anticipating splendid descriptions of Rajahs, Nawabs, golden Musnuds,<note place="foot" resp="editors" > Thrones or
              seats made of cushions.</note> jewel’d turbands, houdah’d Elephants, Tigers and Tyfa’s,<note place="foot" resp="editors" > The
              word is uncommon; probably ‘taif’, a ghost.</note> pecks of Pagodos<note place="foot" resp="editors" > Gold
              coins.</note> and lacks of Rupees,<note place="foot" resp="editors" > A lakh is equivalent to one hundred thousand.
            </note> earnestly requested us to commence our labours and assured us that a Griffin was not “the fearful wild fowl,” we had imagined but
            merely a <foreign>nom de guerre</foreign> given to any European adventurer until he has passed one year of probation in the climate of the
            East.</p>
          <p rend="noCount">Upon a production of the nature now before us, we would willingly be as little severe as our imperative duty to our
            Readers will permit, and though the lash might often have been bestowed, for the most palpable carelessness and want of reflection, we
            would have spared the rod altogether had we not been shocked by the most ridiculous anachronisms; in some places and the most servile
            imitation, in others, the want of unity thro’ out, and above all by the most unpardonable language in which the Author has attempted to
            degrade the loveliest part of Creation. That he has written these calumnies from the heart we cannot believe, and while we render this
            justice to his better feelings, we would warn him of his want of common benevolence, and pity the disposition that could be so palpable,
            so miserably prejudiced by the impulse of the moment. That there are some females even in India whose turpitude of conduct render them
            objects of loathing and disgust to every virtuous mind, we are not prepared to deny – but in the general Women (and particularly British
            Women) whether shivering in the Icy regions of the North or wasting their bloom in the land of the Sun, whether floating on the sea of
            affluence or stemming the rude tide of poverty, in the zenith of joy, or in the day of agony, in the pomp of Vigor, or in the hour of
            Death, twine round the stubborn heart of “Lordly Man,” the object of his purest passions, the sharers of his prosperity and distress, the
            partakers of his joy and his pain, rendering his toils a pleasure, his life a blessing and his home a Heaven!! We trust our readers will
            forgive us for thus trespassing the honest burst of our feelings upon their patience, but we are sure that every one who peruses that
            portion of the book we allude to, will join with us in condemning the acrimony which the Author has so wantonly evinced towards those whom
            he should have considered it his duty to have treated with kindness and his pride to have protected from insult. We trust this lecture
            will shew him the cruelty and malevolence of his conduct and should it awake in him those pangs of remorse which lead to reparation we
            shall not reget the trouble we have now taken “to probe and cure the Canker in his heart.” In the hope that such may be the effect of our
            animadversions we now proceed to the more pleasing part of our duty, that of bestowing praise, and in doing this, we will give our readers
            an outline of the story and occasional extracts that has struck us as deserving of approbation. The Poem commences with the following: – </p>
          <lg>
            <l>List to a “Griffin’s” tale, ye Lords and Gentles </l>
            <l>Into this world near Kew, his Mother brought him</l>
            <l>Heir to no honors, holder of no rentals:</l>
            <l>Of all his squabbling brood, his Father thought him</l>
            <l>Fitter to rise or fall in Regimentals</l>
            <l>And therefore he a Foot Cadetcy bought him</l>
            <l>And sent him furnish’d forth for “British India”</l>
          
          <l>To hunt down Bajee Row<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Baji Rao II of Poona (1775-1852), Peshwa (first minister)
              to the Raja of Satara and nominal head of the Maratha Confederacy, an erstwhile ally of the British, was deposed in 1818 following the
              defeat of Maratha forces at the battle of Kirkee the previous year.</note> and bully Scindeah.<note place="foot" resp="editors"

          </l></lg>
          <p rend="noCount">Next follows in some very animated verses for which we have not room, an account of a dispute that had (previous to the
            opening of the Poem) taken place between the Parents of the Griffin, as to his destination; and the altercation ends in the usual style of
            all Matrimonial controversies, a few tears from the Mother gains the day. </p>

            <l>And as a boy who shivering on the brink</l>
            <l>Of some clear stream, his hesitation chides,</l>
            <l>Yet fearful of the chill he seems to shrink</l>

          <p rend="noCount">After a short residence in the family of which he forms a portion, the Griffins habits seem to have varied and his
            disposition to have become abstracted, gloomy and discontented, evincing much mental disquietude, much restlessness of body and great
            depression of spirits. We are in the dark about the cause of this for several pages, until the author flashes conviction of his
            predicament upon us in his own abrupt and <foreign>outre</foreign> manner. We heard little of the different personages who form the family
            groupe, except in general terms of praise, and little suspected that the God of the unerring Bow had been wreaking his blind Vengeance on
            the heart of our hero but so it proves. – His first acknowledgment of Love to the object of his affections (who by the bye is a married
            woman) is thus described at least as far as we <emph>dare</emph> give it.</p>

            Canto will be much admired; at the same time we regret that the author should have so evidently identified himself with the Griffin. An
              <emph>unknown</emph> writer should be aware that but little interest can by this trick be added to the story and even that little must
            be confined to the limited circle of his own acquaintance, and tho’ he professedly imitates Lord Byron yet this one feature might with

          <p rend="noCount">That we may not make this extraordinary tale, appear more unconnected than it really is (and that to a very considerable
            degree) we must apprize the Reader, that “the Griffin” after wandering over the field of battle (alluding to the Victory of Kirkee) writes
            an account of <emph>it</emph> and his feelings on the occasion to his friends, and here the Poet has made a sad jumble of the ideas that
              <emph>then</emph> pressed upon his mind and his <emph>subsequent</emph> reflections, for while he is scribbling to his relatives about
            the Action he tells them that it is Early Day and that his “favorite Planet is alone shining upon” him, and <emph>then</emph> likens it to
            the “false Beacon” that <emph>ultimately</emph> deluded him, this is one of the many inadvertencies with which the Poem abounds, but his
            lines on the occasion are forcible, and deserve approbation. Alluding to the Morning Star “shining singly in the dark vault of heaven” and
            growing “paler and yet more pale” until at last extinguished by the rising Sun, he says.</p>
          <lg>
            <l>So, mid the darkness of misfortune’s night</l>
            <l>The Phantom star of Hope shines doubly bright</l>

            advantage of the Griffin’s letter to introduce yet (if we may be allowed the Expression) it breaks the <emph>Rhythm</emph> of our feelings
            – it puts us out of the beaten path upon which we had so long travelled – it is like getting into a shuffling trot after a delightful
            canter, it actually made our Indian Co-critic change his position, by taking one foot from the Fender, and throwing his right leg over his
            left; this was a grievance for a gouty man – he felt it and was for some time sorely displeased with the Author – tho’ we pointed out to
            him that the lines were good &amp; many of them exceedingly energetic, as we proved to him in the continuation of the Epistle. – The

            of feeling, a luxuriance and glowing richness of imagery, at the same time mingled with such paroxysms of mental agony and suffering, that
            remind us forcibly of the chastened elegance and fancy of Moore, the saddening touches of Montgomery, the love-breathing tenderness of
            Campbell, and the fearful sublimity and pathos of Lord Byron.<note place="foot" resp="editors" > Thomas Moore

            <l>I promised you Platonic Love and fighting</l>
            <l>And Humbug – All of which in order due</l>
            <l>I have most faithfully pourtrayed and quite in</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Platonic Love was Marions! (this with Pride)</l>
            <l>(Howe’er ye Lady-puritans may scoff it) </l>
            <l>I will prove: – first by the Lamp’s flame that died,</l>
            <l>And by th’ <emph xml:space="preserve">unwitness’d </emph>Deed of course I profit – </l>

            <l>Tell me from what Platonic Love can rise.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>I asked this Question once before and then</l>
            <l>A modern <title level="m">Pamela</title><note place="foot" resp="editors"> The heroine of Samuel Richardson’s
                  <title level="m">Pamela: or, Virtue Rewarded</title> (1<hi rendition="#superscript">st</hi> pub. 1740) was a servant who maintained her
                ‘virtue’ by resisting the advances of her employer, Mr. B; her steadfastness was eventually rewarded with marriage to him. </note> who
              shall be nameless</l>

            <l>To make Infatuated Girls as shameless – </l>
            <l>A sweet insidious Sin, she called it when</l>
            <l>First tasted and it palled not, nor grew tameless!</l>
            <l>I wonder from what Tutors and what College</l>
            <l>This Girl got so much Love – Platonic knowledge?!</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>But Pamela reminds me of my pledge</l>
            <l>Given some time ago. I’ll now redeem it –</l>
            <l>I knew that I should find a space to wedge</l>
            <l>Her portrait in, and if the world esteem it</l>
            <l>A caricature – or if they should alledge </l>

                translation is ‘if the cat itself growls’ – this would require the nominative ‘feles’ rather than the genitive ‘felis’, but the text

            <l>Her hair was dark – her brow of iv’ry framed,</l>

                previous near to Seroor and there are many eye witnesses who can vouch for the truth of the incident here alluded to, as well as the
                successful issue of that intrepid attack. [Brigadier General Lionel Smith, the officer commanding the East India Company forces at the
                battle of Ashta, mentions the sound of the enemy nagaras, or drums, in his dispatch of 21 February 1818 (<title level="j">Asiatic

            Style, and expose to the world the plagiarisms of which he has been guilty. This threat we are sure will not deter him from his purpose of
            publishing his conclusion of his Tale at the same time it may induce him to be more cautious. We were rejoiced to see some symptoms of
            amendment in his Anti-woman Mania and as his present work closes with it we shall also make it the Finale of our Review.</p>

                / On woman, and attend her sov’reign pleasure!’ (18). Tricked by him into believing that he has married under false pretences, and is
                without rank or means, she agrees to abide with him for a month in poverty, and thereby undergoes a ‘metamorphosis’, coming to believe
                that ‘modesty, in deed, in word, and thought, / Is the prime grace of woman; and with that, / More than by frowning looks and saucy
                speeches, / She may persuade the man that rightly loves her; / Whom she was ne’er intended to command’ (71). </note></l>
