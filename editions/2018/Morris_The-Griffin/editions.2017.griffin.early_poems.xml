          <l>Sweet Lady – bid me not retract the vow</l>
          <l>In love’s sincerest, purest ardour spoken,</l>

          <l>How bleeds my heart – oh God! how hath it bled</l>
          <l>Wailing thy faithlessness in agony! – </l>
          <l>For, thou wert young &amp; beautiful – We met,</l>

          <l>The booming of the death-drum from yon glen</l>

          <l><emph>Then</emph> – shall my vow be cancelled – not <emph>till then!</emph></l>
          <l>For still I love thee – still I’ll keep the vow</l>
          <l>In love’s sincerest, purest ardour spoken,</l>
          <l>Nor upon other shrines can offer now</l>
          <l>The bleeding heart which thy cold scorn hath broken. </l>

        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center">THE OBSERVER No. XIV<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Columns headed ‘The Observer’ and signed by ‘J.’ appear
              occasionally in the <emph xml:space="preserve">Bombay Gazette </emph>in 1818-1819: a full list is given in the Bibliography.
              While the first seems to be a serious discussion of religious faith among the British in India, the column quickly took on a knowing
              tone and a satiric approach to subjects including the Bombay theatre (IX and XI), the qualities required for success in India (VI,
              XIII), the means necessary for those returning to Britain to live adequately (III, V), ladies’ fashions (IV), and letters from
              correspondents speculating on the identity and circumstances of the ‘Observer’ himself. Numbers IV and X are of particular interest in
              the context of <emph>The Griffin</emph>’s anti-feminism, as both introduce letters from supposed female correspondents
              preoccupied with appearance and with the prospect of a lucrative marriage. Eliza Scanty comes out to India ‘with an entire new Wardrobe
              of the latest fashions’, thinking ‘of nothing else on the voyage but the pleasure of exhibiting my person (which by the bye I think a
              very tolerable one) to the greatest advantage’; and targets the ‘Observer’ with flirtatious remarks: ‘I am sure you are a Civilian, and
              I would lay a bet you are young and handsome’ (IV). The letter from ‘Curvilia’ reinforces <emph>The Griffin</emph>’s focus on
              sexualized female bodies: ‘I have been three years in India, and when I first arrived, what with tight lacing, the stocks, and the
              backboard I landed as upright as possible. Though I had lots of fishes at my hook, and plenty of nibbles, yet my erect manner gained me
              but one bite and that was from an elderly <emph xml:space="preserve">Cadet </emph>whom I civilly rejected[.] The Civilians
              said I was as stiff as a poker, and the military swore I had swallowed a ramrod, how vulgar! I was rather pretty, rather genteel, rather
              accomplished and rather amiable, yet still somehow I was rather single, and time threatened to leave me withering on the Virgin thorn,
              but taking example from several Girls, who by greater pliability of back and greater exposure to <emph>squinting eyes</emph>
              &amp; <emph>nightly colds</emph>, most surprisingly soon enjoyed the sweets of wedlock. I resolved to <emph
                >bend</emph> to circumstances and shall still continue in spite of Mr. Observer, or his Dandy friend “to stoop to Conquer”’ (X).

        <p rend="noCount">A certain Presidency, Mr. Observer, swarms with these unlicensed railers at Matrimony. A lecture from your pen might prove of service to
          them, by shewing their ill-natured propensity in its true light. I am a married man, and, since my arrival in India, I have seldom mixed in
          society without having my mind put into a state of irritability from the unvaried and constant allusion to the <emph
            >horrors</emph> of <emph>Wedlock</emph>, which is ever reviled as a state of strife and bondage. You must, I am sure, be well
          aware of the happiness and respectability of a married life, and will, I trust, point out the ill-nature, aye, and the ill-breeding of
          making it a handle for pointed ridicule and execrable puns at the expence of other people’s feelings. Matrimony, I know, has ever been a
          subject for the smart sayings and “devilish good things” of the witlings of the age. No wonder then, that these <emph>Scoffers
            at Love</emph>, when they change their minds (for they all do, or <emph>long</emph> to do so) should, upon <emph
            >experience</emph>, after so many repartees and <emph>jests</emph> find <emph>Matrimony no Joke!!</emph></p>
        <p rend="noCount"> The following lines were dropped by one of these <emph>“Bachelors for Ever</emph>” whilst the <emph>Exquisite</emph>
          was taking from his coat-pocket his “<hi rendition="#smallcaps">Book of Steps</hi>” for the Quadrille he was practising. Though written with
          feeling, there breathes throughout such a spirit of hatred and rancour, that, I trust, with some animadversions from your pen, they will
          defeat their own end. They evidently formed part of some longer Poem, and I beg you will give them speedy publicity.<note place="foot"

          <l>Yes I have passed an hour of madness,</l>
          <l>An hour of such delirious joy,</l>
          <l>That not an age of grief and sadness,</l>
          <l>The fond remembrance can destroy.</l>
          <l>’Twas holy midnight calm and still,</l>
          <l>The Moonbeam slept upon the hill,</l>
          <l>Beneath the shade of the Cypress tree,</l>
          <l>I couched in wild expectancy.</l>
          <l>She came all doubting, trembling, o’er the path she flew,</l>
          <l>With paly lip and cheek and bosom glistening with dew.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg><l>And to my arms she sprung and panted,</l>
        <l>Quick as the new-caught Cushat Dove,</l>
        <l>And, o’er her as I hung enchanted,</l>
        <l>I whisper’d – “Fly with me my love:</l>
        <l>With me to live with me to die,</l>
        <l>In Love’s unshackled Liberty”!</l>
        <l>Her bosom rose with hastier swell,</l>
        <l>As if in agony it rose and fell,</l>
        <l>Like the waves of stormy ocean!</l>
        <l>Trembling she gasped in wild emotion.</l>
        <l>And “Cease,” she said “is this thy faith, could <emph xml:space="preserve">you </emph>ensnare me.</l>
        <l>“Not <emph>thus</emph>, clasp me not <emph>thus</emph>, Oh God! in pity, spare me!!”</l></lg>
        <lg><l>Alone she stood her tears fast falling,</l>
        <l>In Joy’s wild flow, bedew’d the sod.</l>
        <l>For from a trial so appalling,</l>
        <l><emph>Spotless</emph> she stood! I thank my God!!</l>
        <l>There was but <emph>one</emph> cloud in the sky,</l>
        <l>And it was white as maidens breast,</l>
        <l>On the Cold Moon! she raised her eye,</l>
        <l>And whilst her soft warm lip I press’d,</l>
        <l>“Yon solitary cloud” she said.</l>
        <l>(And as she spoke, my bosom bled),</l>
        <l>Yon snowy cloud pure tho’ it be,</l>
        <l>Emblems my fault my frailty,</l>
        <l>My ev’ry act and thought ‘till this clandestine meeting given.</l>
        <l>Were holy, calm and passionless and pure as cloudless heaven!</l></lg>
        <lg><l>She speaks not now – again she spoke not,</l>
        <l>But prone to Earth in Death she fell,</l>
        <l>My heart’s throb ceased but yet it broke not!</l>
        <l>Without a groan I gazed – A spell,</l>
        <l>Bound every sense, save sight alone,</l>
        <l>I was a bloodless, tearless stone!</l>
        <l>The cloud sailed past the Moon, whose ray, </l>
        <l>Fell on her bosom as she lay.</l>
        <l>Methought it heav’d! it heav’d by Heaven! could Fate such bosoms sever.</l>
        <l>She <emph>rose!</emph> – One kiss! one last embrace!! we parted then for ever!!!</l></lg>
        <lg><l>‘T was in this very path I met her,</l>
        <l>‘T was on this very spot we stood,</l>
        <l>And oh! if ever I forget her,</l>
        <l>May ev’ry hope of future good,</l>
        <l>Of Bliss hereafter – Fortune, Fame,</l>
        <l>And ev’ry joy mankind can claim,</l>
        <l>Fade from my grasp, as shadows flee;</l>
        <l>May Life’s dull cup be filled by thee.</l>
        <l>Thou loved one of my soul! and let each deeper draught contain.</l>
        <l>The bitterest Dregs of Misery and agonizing pain!</l></lg>
