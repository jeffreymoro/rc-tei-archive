                  <div type="section">
                     <p rend="noCount">This edition showcases the poetry of Thomas D’Arcy Morris (1792-1835), a significant figure in the Bombay literary scene of the early
            nineteenth century. It identifies and attributes Morris’s works, originally published anonymously or pseudonymously in contemporary
            newspapers and periodicals. The central text is the long review / poem <title level="m">The Griffin</title>, accompanied by some related
            earlier works by Morris, and some contextual correspondence. The edition also includes a list of later anonymous and pseudonymous works by
            Morris from the <title level="j">Oriental Sporting Magazine </title>(1828-1833). </p>

                     <head>The text</head>
                     <p rend="noCount">The text of <title level="m">The Griffin</title>, the early works and the contemporary correspondence has been transcribed from microfilm
            copies held by the British Library of the <title level="j">Bombay Gazette</title> (SM44) and the
            <title level="j">Bombay Courier</title> (SM70). The microfilm images are of variable quality, but generally decipherable.
            End-of-line commas and full stops within verse passages are occasionally indistinguishable, and in these cases I have assigned the character
            that appears to be called for by the sense of the lines: in no case does making a choice involve a substantive issue of meaning. </p>
                     <p rend="noCount">Spelling, punctuation and capitalisation are reproduced as in the original, with the following exceptions: </p>

                        <item>where verse passages of quoted speech have quotation marks at the beginning and end of each line (the text is inconsistent in this
              respect), these have been omitted, retaining only the opening and closing characters of each passage; </item>
                        <item>where an error is clearly that of a compositor (eg the initial character of a line transposed with the corresponding character in the
              line immediately below; or a quotation mark opening apparently at random and never closed), these errors have been silently corrected and
              a list of the corrections supplied. </item>

                  <p rend="noCount">Research for this edition was part funded by a British Academy / Leverhulme Small Grant. I am grateful to the staff of the British Library
            in London and the Maharashtra State Archives in Mumbai for their help and expertise in the course of my research, to Lynda Pratt for her
            advice at an early stage of this project, and to Nicola Royan and Margaret-Anne Hutton for guidance on sources and translations. Trinity
            Cheltenham, the current congregation of Holy Trinity Church, Portland Street, Cheltenham, were extremely helpful in facilitating my search
            for Catharine Hickes’s memorial. Thanks to the Romantic Circles team, especially Dave Rettenmaier, for their invaluable contribution to this project.</p>

                  <p>The main text of this edition is a review of a hypothetical poem, ‘The Griffin’, the ‘maiden effort of an Indian Subaltern’s Muse’,
            supposedly published in an unnamed London periodical and then reproduced in the <title level="j">Bombay Gazette</title> during the autumn
            of 1820.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"> ‘From the ***** Review, Published at London by Richard Paterson, &amp; Co., 25 Long Lane,
              Third Edition – with Plates’, <title level="j">Bombay Gazette</title> 30 August 1820; further instalments appeared on 6 September, 20
              September, 25 October, 6 December and 27 December. </note> This poem, which exists only in the form of passages quoted within the
            review, is described by the reviewer as ‘written in burlesque imitation (if we may use such a phrase when the thing burlesqued is in
            itself a Burlesque) of Lord Byron’s witty yet shamelessly indecent Don Juan; void of all its richest beauties and destitute also of its
            licentiousness and depravity’.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn2" n="2">
                        <title level="j">Bombay Gazette</title> 30 August 1820.</note> Serialized in six parts, the review / poem<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn3" n="3"> I use ‘The Griffin’ to refer to the embedded poem, and <title level="m">The Griffin</title> to refer to the entire
              review / poem text. </note> chronicles its protagonist’s arrival in India, his encounters with Bombay society, his experiences in the
            army and his relations with a series of women, one of whom commits herself to him and then reneges on her promises. It was the work of
            Thomas D’Arcy (or Darcy) Morris,<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn4" n="4"> The name appears in both forms. I have preferred that used by J.H.
              Stocqueler in his obituary of Morris, as Stocqueler was also the editor who published many of Morris’s works in the <title level="j">Oriental Sporting Magazine</title>.</note> at the time a 28-year-old Lieutenant in the 1<hi rendition="#superscript">st</hi> Battalion of
            the 12<hi rendition="#superscript">th</hi> Regiment of the Bombay Native Infantry – the parallels between author and protagonist are more than
            situational, as Daric (the eponymous Griffin, or newcomer to India) and his lover Carineth were recognised by readers as thinly-disguised
            versions of Morris himself and Catharine Hickes, the wife of one of his friends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="m">The Griffin</title> is accompanied in this edition by two sets of related texts. One comprises Morris’s poems (and the
            essay ‘An Eastern Vision’) appearing in the year preceding the publication of <title level="m">The Griffin</title> in the <title level="j">Bombay Gazette</title> and the <title level="j">Bombay Courier</title>, under the pseudonyms ‘M.E.’ and ‘Uxorius’. These texts are
            forerunners and in some cases proto-fragments of the longer work; they anticipate its concerns (primarily the love affair at the heart of
              <title level="m">The Griffin</title>, but also its observations of the world of Bombay), and they experiment with the characters and
            situations that would later form part of the review / poem. </p>
                  <p>The other set of related texts is constituted by letters of commentary and criticism to the editors of the same newspapers, some in prose
            and some in verse, interspersed with the instalments of <title level="m">The Griffin</title> throughout the course of its publication. Two
            of these raise queries about the authenticity of ‘The Griffin’ and the identity of its author. Others contest, or appear to contest, its
            misogyny, although the tone of these communications – ‘A blush of Maiden modesty suffuses my cheeks while forming this Epistle, the first
            I ever wrote to one of the male sex’ – indicates their satiric intent.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn5" n="5"> Priscilla Wishfort to the
                <title level="j">Bombay Courier</title> (21 October 1820). </note> They are signed with a variety of pseudonyms, in keeping with
            contemporary practice, where communications for publication were by convention anonymous or pseudonymous (a correspondent who insisted on
            using his own name attracted outraged accusations of vanity from others, who pointed out that ‘writers in a newspaper, however high their
            abilities may be, in general prefer to make their public appearance in such flying sheets under a nom de guerre’).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn6" n="6"> See the correspondence from and about J.W. Graham (<title level="j">Bombay Courier</title>, 22 and 29 September
              1821). </note> Some might conceivably be genuine inquiries from readers, such as the letter asking ‘if the author of the Poem is
            actually in England or India’, in order to ‘dispel the distrust’ prevailing among those who wondered whether the writer might be found in
            their own circles.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn7" n="7"> ‘No-Griffin’ to the <title level="j">Bombay Courier</title>, 30 September
              1820.</note> At the other extreme, the exuberant listing by ‘Slapatema Hopeful’ of her rejected suitors, together with her rejoicing in
            the prospect of another ‘<emph>thirty </emph>years to flirt about, before I am <emph>on the list</emph> of antiquated virginity’, and her
            contemptuous dismissal of ‘that superficial Griffin’, reads like a continuation outside the text of <title level="m">The Griffin</title>
            of the sex wars fought within it. Given the way in which these letters enter into and exacerbate <title level="m">The Griffin</title>’s
            themes of misogyny, conflict and satiric representation of individuals, it is very possible that some are the work of Morris himself – a
            theory borne out by his production of similar pseudonymous critical responses to his own works in the <title level="m">Oriental Sporting
              Magazine</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn8" n="8"> See the items by ‘Stephen’ included in the ‘List of works by Thomas D’Arcy
              Morris’.</note> In the absence of evidence of authorship, it might be preferable to regard at least some of them as potentially
            genuine readers’ responses to Morris’s work, indicative of his Bombay readership’s interest in and capacity for entering into the
            sophisticated literary parody sustained throughout the correspondence. </p>

                  <head>The author</head>
                  <p>Thomas D’Arcy Morris (1792-1835) was born in London, the eldest son of Thomas Morris, a customs official, and his wife Mary. His entire
            adult life was spent in the service of the East India Company in the Bombay army. Arriving in Bombay as a cadet in 1808, he remained there
            (with the exception of periods of leave overseas) until his death, along with two brothers, also army officers, and four sisters who
            married army officers.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn9" n="9"> ‘The Author of the “Mighty Boar”’, <title level="m">Times of India</title>
              21 October 1881, p. 2. Family historians have compiled an extensive genealogy of the Morris siblings; see http://www.asletts.com/node/7
              [23 July 2016]. </note> During his army career – where he attained the rank of captain, and worked for many years as paymaster – he is
            credited with having devised plans for a ‘retiring fund’, or pension scheme, and with being an effective advocate at courts martial, as
            well as maintaining the amateur pursuits of actor, poet, and ‘<foreign>arbiter elegentarium</foreign>’ (to quote his obituary) of his
            circle of acquaintances.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn10" n="10"> ‘The Sportsman’, <title level="j">Englishman</title>, 8 May 1835.</note>
            He was also secretary of Poona racecourse, and a sportsman renowned both for hunting and for writing popular songs in celebration of the
            hunt, his works a mainstay of the <title level="j">Oriental Sporting Magazine</title>. His death, on 13 April 1835, occurred as a
            consequence of fever, and possibly wounds, suffered through ‘long and severe exposure’ while he was leading his regiment, the 24<hi rendition="#superscript">th</hi> Native Infantry, against Bhil raiders.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn11" n="11">
                        <title level="j">Asiatic Journal</title>, October 1835, p. 127. This introduction draws on and extends my earlier work on Morris in
                <title level="m">The Poetry of British India</title>, vol. 1 (London: Pickering &amp; Chatto, 2011), pp. 175-176; and a brief account

              material. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The records of Morris’s time in India are not extensive: apart from routine mentions in army lists, the <title level="m">Bombay
              Calendar</title> and similar outlets, and his uncomplicated will leaving everything to his daughter (see below), there are few personal
            remnants of his life and work. The exception is a letter to Mountstuart Elphinstone, Governor of Bombay 1819-1827 (the original survives
            among Elphinstone’s papers), communicating a request for preferment. Responding to the prospect of changes in the Pay Department (to which
            Elphinstone had nominated him in November 1824) which might deprive him of his post as deputy paymaster, he refers to the ‘marks of
            kindness’ already received from Elphinstone, and requests that ‘should any change in the Pay Department take place, I beg my dear sir that
            you will send me to the Deccan where the earliest &amp; happiest days of my service have been passed’.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn12" n="12"> Morris to Mountstuart Elphinstone, 27 September 1827 (BL Mss Eur F88/276, ff. 138-139). A verse ‘Address to Elphinstone’ on his
              departure from India, written by Morris later that year, is included in the <title level="j">Oriental Sporting Magazine</title> (October
              1830), 2.39- 41. </note> (The letter appears to have achieved its objective: Morris was promoted to paymaster of the Malwa Field Force
            the same year, and later transferred to the Poona Division, but he remained in the Pay Department for all but one year of his subsequent
              career.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn13" n="13">
                        <title level="m">Bombay Calendar</title>, 1827-1835.</note>)</p>
                  <p>Morris’s reference to his service in the Deccan foregrounds his personal involvement in the military actions of the early nineteenth
            century, a series of campaigns culminating in the third Anglo-Maratha war of 1817-1818. This conflict, resulting in defeat for the Maratha
            Confederacy which had controlled much of north and central India, paved the way for the consolidation of British power in the Deccan, and
            the expansion of the administrative area of the Bombay Presidency. These events underlie the personal stories of <title level="m">The
              Griffin</title> and the early poems, and their associated geographical and military landmarks also constitute a zone of mutual
            understanding between Morris and his first readers, many of whom were also participants in the East India Company’s civil and military
            establishment in Bombay. The defeat twice over of Maratha forces at the battles of Kirkee (Khadki) and Ashtee (Ashta) in late 1817,
            occasions which form the background to the second instalment of <title level="m">The Griffin</title>, was crucial to the Company’s
            achievement of control over the Deccan. The places invoked throughout the text – such as Poona (Poonah, Pune) and Sholapoor (Solapur),
            both locations where Morris had served – are part of that recently conquered territory, and demonstrate the extent to which the immediate
            history of the colony is already informing its literature. </p>

                  <head>The story of <title level="m">The Griffin</title> and its aftermath</head>
                  <p>The <title level="j">Englishman</title> newspaper’s obituary of Morris discreetly skirts the controversy caused by <title level="m">The
              Griffin</title>, ‘some passages in which, as they touched the reputation of a female member of the society of Bombay, formed the
            ground-work of a court martial’.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn14" n="14"> ‘The Sportsman’, <title level="j">Englishman</title>, 8 May
              1835. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>This court martial was the outcome of a series of interactions between Morris and another officer, Frederick Hickes. Morris was charged
            with ‘disgraceful conduct, unbecoming the Character of an Officer and a Gentleman’ on two counts relating to the practice of settling
            differences or avenging insults by means of a duel. In 1821, immediately following publication of the final instalment of <title level="m">The Griffin</title>, he had refused to respond appropriately (presumably by issuing a challenge to fight) when Hickes insulted him with
            ‘the most opprobrious Epithets’.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn15" n="15"> ‘Court martial of Lt TD Morris of 12<hi rendition="#superscript">th</hi> NI held 28 July and 22 August 1823’, IOR L/Mil/17/4/292, pp. 87-88, BL.</note> Two years later, in 1823, he attempted to
            provoke Hickes to a duel. No explanation was offered of his apparently contradictory actions. </p>
                  <p>Reading between the lines of the L/Mil records, and the documented details of the careers of both men, these events look like the outcome
            of a triangular relationship, the nature of which became clear to all the participants only on publication of <title level="m">The
              Griffin</title>. Frederick Hickes, a fellow officer and friend of Morris, was posted alongside him between 1817 and 1820, first in the
            Peshwah’s Brigade and then in the Poonah Auxiliary Force.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn16" n="16">
                        <title level="m">Bombay Calendar</title>, 1818-1820.</note> During this period, in March 1818, Hickes married Catharine Billamore.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn17" n="17">
                        <title level="j">Asiatic Journal</title>, December 1818, p. 673.</note> A daughter was born to them a year later, and another daughter
            died in infancy in June 1821. If Catharine Billamore is the subject of the lines ‘To C—B—’, published by Morris in May 1819, she was at
            the time of her marriage also the subject of Morris’s attention, and may have made some kind of promise to him, which she reneged on in
            order to marry Hickes. This work points to a romantic interest – initially requited – between them, where Catharine’s repudiation of
            Morris and marriage to Hickes became the occasion of a series of self-involved narratives of love and rejection. ‘To C—B—’ reproaches its
            subject with ‘faithlessness’, and represents her as thoughtlessly abandoning the writer for another:

          This mode of writing – combining self-pity, fury at her betrayal and a misogynistic dwelling on the ‘fickleness’ of women – is maintained
            through several other versions of the abandoned lover’s story. An early ‘Fragment’ of what would become <title level="m">The
              Griffin</title> gives the woman in question the suggestively acronymical name of ‘Carineth’, and has the speaker, Daric (a near miss for
            ‘D’Arcy’), return from battle to find her ‘Wedded to him, my best, my bosom friend’. This situation is replicated in the prose ‘Eastern
            Vision’ where the narrator reflects on ‘the fate of many a warm hearted Youth, who relying upon the virgin-vows of some impatient female,
            obey’d the calls of Duty and Honour and returned to the object of his Adoration <emph>time enough</emph> to find her “The Bride of
              Another”!!’<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn18" n="18">

            re-enacting the scene of parting from Daric as a prelude to entering ‘the pale of matrimony “almost unsought and totally unwoo’d”’, it is
            in the context of a work which all but proclaims its status as roman à clef: ‘the objects thus satirized may <emph>possibly</emph> be the
            mere creatures of [the poet’s] imagination but to us they appear to issue so fresh in feature and with such undoubted impress of real Life

            provoke … Hickes to fight a Duel on grounds connected with the … circumstances’ of January 1821, and eventually bringing about the
            court-martial. The fact that the court acquitted him of all charges, to the dismay of the commander in chief who pointed out that the

                  <head> ‘It was his own life…’</head>
                  <p>Over sixty years after the events described in <title level="m">The Griffin</title>, a correspondent of the <title level="j">Times of
              India</title> wrote to claim that he had been acquainted with Morris, a friend of his father’s, ‘in my youth, now alas about fifty years
            ago’. This letter correctly identifies Morris as the author of hunting songs, but its references to <title level="m">The Griffin</title>
            are inaccurate – the text is cited as ‘Life of Tom Raw the Griffin’<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn26" n="26">
                        <title level="m">Tom Raw, the Griffin</title>, by a Civilian and an Officer on the Bengal Establishment [Charles D’Oyly and James
              Atkinson] (London: Ackermann, 1828). A later correspondent contests the association of Morris with <title level="m">Tom Raw: The
                Griffin</title>, and raises the alternative possibility that he might be the author of <title level="m">The Grand Master: or,
                Adventures of Qui Hi in Hindustan</title>, by ‘Quiz’ (1816) (A.C., ‘Tom Raw, the Griffin’, <title level="j">Times of India</title> 24
              October 1881, p. 2). This is at least theoretically possible – Morris in 1816 had been eight years in India – but it does not seem
              likely that the author would have produced first the sustained narrative and technical achievement of <title level="m">The Grand
                Master</title> (and had the resources to have it published in London, with Rowlandson’s engravings) and only then the short and
              repetitive poems and fragmentary narrative forms that make up <title level="m">The Griffin</title> and its forerunners.</note>
            (confusing it with the far more widely read later poem of that name) – and attributes its publication to the <title level="j">Courier</title> rather than the <title level="j">Gazette</title>. The writer continues: ‘It was his <emph>own</emph> life on first
            arrival in the country. He was engaged to a young lady, a very handsome one; however, there was a disagreement, and he got soured and
            wrote this work, and it was privately circulated amongst his personal friends.’<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn27" n="27"> Budha Admin, ‘To
              the editor of the <title level="j">Times of India</title>’, <emph>Times of India</emph>, 15 October 1881, p. 6. </note> The
            inconsistencies of this account, and the time elapsed between the events described and the correspondent’s recollection, are reasons to
            treat the rationale offered with caution – but the reference to an engagement perhaps merely formalizes the abandoned promise which
            underlies the early poems, the focus for the writer’s fury and despair. </p>
                  <p>These early works turn in each case on a scene of trauma and betrayal experienced by a protagonist who returns from battle to find that
            his promised beloved has married his friend. The ‘warm hearted Youth’ of ‘An Eastern Vision’ finds ‘the object of his Adoration’ has
            become ‘The Bride of Another’; the addressee of ‘To C—.B—.’ has ‘Leapt to <emph>another’s</emph> arms’; the Carineth of ‘A Fragment’ is
            ‘Wedded to him, my best, my bosom friend’, and so on. The explanation for her conduct is variously given as ‘woman’s fickleness’,
            faithlessness, impatience – the qualities of what ‘Observer XIV’ terms a ‘<emph>true woman</emph>’. The overriding point is clearly about
            the infidelity of women, and the impact of this particular woman’s betrayal of the man who loved her. </p>
                  <p>In <title level="m">The Griffin</title>, a more complicated story is alluded to. The reviewer’s remarks on Canto 4 suggest that the
            reason for the breakdown of relations between Carineth and Daric appears to be on his side, rather than hers – ‘he had found means to
            communicate to her that an invincible obstacle prevented their Union’ – and are thus at odds with the version offered in the earlier
            fragments, where Daric is represented as overcome by her decision to send him away. In Canto 6, a different version again: ‘Soon after the
            rupture between Babille and the Griffin, Carineth, who had watched the progress of the Amour, now treats him with marked reserve and
            almost merited Contempt’. She eventually rejects him, leaving him ‘to wander thro’ the world the victim of a hopeless passion – a prey to
            miserable and vain regret whilst the object of his affections, enters the pale of matrimony “almost unsought and totally unwoo’d.”’ Here,
            unlike any of the earlier versions, the woman’s point of view is given, and given in direct speech: 
          <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>…’twould now be weak to rail</l>
                           <l>Or sigh for one, who would that sigh deride</l>
                           <l>Who, by the hour of parting, moan, and wail</l>
                           <l>Flew to <emph>another</emph> shrine and knelt and sighed </l>
                           <l>And woo’d a face of Smiles … (Canto 6, ll. 183-187).</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote>
           These variations of the story, with their movement away from the basic theme of Carineth’s faithlessness, might be attributable to a
            changing mood of the writer, or to the narrative complexity inherent in the longer form of the review / poem, where multiple characters
            and episodes complicate the spare landscape of the earlier texts. Nonetheless, the attitude to women more generally expressed by the
            writer remains constant, as the more nuanced representation of Carineth is accompanied by the deployment of the freakishly untrustworthy
            ‘woman-Serpent’ Babille, false from her hair and her teeth to her ‘flirting, fibbing, scandal and back biting’ (Canto 6, ll. 135-142). As
            this, rather than the plight of the abandoned lover, strikes the key-note of <title level="m">The Griffin</title>, it suggests that the
            writer was left with a lasting contempt for his female compatriots. </p>
                  <p>Morris’s later work bears this out, as it concerns almost exclusively the masculine world of sport – hunting, horse-racing – and avoids
            any engagement with his former subjects. A hunting poem, ‘Saddle, Spur and Spear’, chronicles the transition in words which all but compel
            a biographical reading:

                     <title level="m">The Griffin</title>’s ‘Anti-woman Mania’</head>
                  <p>One of the most striking aspects of Morris’s work is its misogyny, which finds expression in three ways. First is the resentful depiction
            of women as status-seeking and faithless, summed up in the embedded poem of ‘The Observer XIV’: the female protagonist is said to value
            ‘Rank’ in a prospective partner over the quality of a ‘warm’ heart. Her decision to cast aside her lover and marry his friend is
            represented as a trait of the female sex more generally, rather than indicative of her personal characteristics: the action of a
              ‘<emph>true woman</emph>’. Second, the material bodies of women are represented as grotesque and revolting to men, as the apparent
            allure of Babille, for instance, turns out to conceal a combination of physical repulsiveness and artificial enhancements: 
          <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>Her bloom, hair teeth and neck, struck Daric’s senses,</l>
                           <l>But soon the youth recover’d, from the shock</l>
                           <l>For he found out (<emph>how</emph> I’lle not say – but hence his</l>
                           <l>Disgust) they were at bed-time under lock</l>
                           <l>And key – with <emph>all </emph>her little prominences!! (<title level="m">The Griffin</title>, Canto 6, ll. 143-147). </l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote>
          Third, the text continually returns to a repetitive trope of entrapment, dwelling on figures such as the ‘dame well-skilled in
            husband-seeking’ who ‘by some artful and expert manoeuvre / … lures a gilded gudgeon to the Bait’ (Canto 6, l. 250); or Vivian, who uses
            the spell given her by Merlin to trap him (Canto 6, 115-130). ‘Man is their prey’, the implied poet of ‘The Griffin’ writes (Canto 6, l.
            48). The reviewer, for his part, seemingly contests the misogyny of the poem’s text by highlighting ‘the most unpardonable language in
            which the Author has attempted to degrade the loveliest part of Creation’. This strategy frames and draws attention to exactly the theme
            it appears to decry, and the brief mention of supportive and beloved ‘Women (and particularly British Women)’ is overshadowed by the
            account of those ‘females even in India whose turpitude of conduct render them objects of loathing and disgust to every virtuous mind’
            (Canto 1). When Daric’s encounter with Marion, his ‘<emph>proper </emph>Love’, is mentioned by the reviewer, it is simultaneously elided:
            ‘Her appearance is most interestingly described, her character exquisitely pourtrayed, the opening of his passion and her confession
            together with their extraordinary adventures and final disappointment, separation and misery, form one of the most pathetic Episodes we
            have ever read.’ But, the reviewer continues, ‘We will not anticipate the readers delight which this affecting tale will impart...’ (Canto
            3). The present, but invisible, phantom of the ‘proper’ woman is contrasted with the all-too-concretely imagined versions of the improper
            feminine: Babille the ‘Talking shuttle cock’, Pamela with her ‘carrion’ breath and addiction to ‘lying and to liquor’.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn29" n="29">

                  </p>
                  <p>Some of this attitude will inevitably be attributed to the personal circumstances of the writer, and the obsessively repeated depiction
            in the early works of the betraying woman is evidence of the importance of this figure to Morris himself. At the same time, a comparable
            mistrust of women is more widely visible across the periodicals of colonial Bombay. As <title level="m">The Griffin</title> was being
            published in the <title level="j">Bombay Gazette</title>, another poem in the rival <title level="j">Courier </title>remarked on the
            immodesty of women (‘nature’s self is frail’, and ‘I’d have maids vestals – till they’re brides’); and the same writer later evokes the
            spectre of a woman’s corrupt body: ‘the flush of beauty’s face / Hiding disease – by adding grace.’<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn30" n="30"> Anti-Waltz, ‘A Poetic Hint: Reasons why I dislike Waltzing and Spanish Dances’, <title level="j">Bombay Courier</title>, 22 July
              1820; Anti-Waltz, ‘In reply to the Lines in the last Gazette’, <title level="j">Bombay Courier</title>, 19 August 1820. </note> The
            theme of entrapment in Morris’s work is echoed in the notion of the freedom of bachelorhood being curtailed by ‘Wedlock’s mystic chain’, a
            weight dragging its victim ‘to dreary Earth again’.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn31" n="31"> E., ‘Riddle’, <title level="j">Bombay
                Courier</title>, 21 October 1820.</note> More directly, the long poem ‘Woman’ discusses several types of women and relationships,
            beginning with Eve’s ‘foolish heart’ and ‘empty head’, and concluding: ‘Few Females are deceived by Man alone / The Fault is partly, or is
            all their Own.’<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn32" n="32">

                  </p>
                  <p>Such representations of women and relationships should be viewed in the context of a colonial society based on the civil and military
            structures of the East India Company, where pay increased only with seniority, leaving junior officers without independent means in often
            straitened circumstances. (On attaining the rank of major in 1834, Morris was paid nearly three times the amount he received as a
            lieutenant in 1820, but he had by then been in the Company’s service for twenty-five years.) Simultaneously, the gender imbalance in the
            makeup of that society – the ‘great number of men’, as Maria Graham puts it, in relation to a small number of women – underlies the sexual
            politics of colonial Bombay.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn33" n="33"> Maria Graham, <title level="m">Journal of a Residence in

                  <p>The sensational story at the heart of <title level="m">The Griffin</title> should not become a distraction from the larger context for
            Morris’s work. The poem is not just about the protagonist, or about Bombay society; it is also a writing back to the literary
            establishment of Britain. This is represented by the supposed reviewer of ‘The Griffin’, whose ignorance of the social and linguistic
            norms of colonial society is established from the outset. Led by the title to expect a ‘tale of German Horrors, a tissue of deaths heads
            and blue lights’, rather than the account of a novice traveller to India, he maintains throughout the review a stance of distaste for the
            world of Bombay, commenting upon the ‘disgusting minuteness’ with which the poem describes the inhabitants of the country.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn35" n="35">
                        <title level="m">The Griffin</title>, Canto 1, Canto 2. </note> Hampered by his lack of knowledge and attitude of disdain, this reviewer
            is held up to ridicule by an author who invites his readers to re-evaluate their own accustomed position of distance from and dependence
            on the metropolis. Rather than finding themselves literally and figuratively at the end of a line, waiting months for the supply of ideas,
            texts and cultural forms to travel from Britain to Bombay, colonial readers are invited to enjoy a position of relative advantage. When
            the reviewer remarks that ‘the description of [the dawn breaking] appears one of the Author’s best specimens of Eastern scenery, but we
            leave the greatest portion of it out, that it may reach with all the additional effect of novelty, those who may have witnessed and can
            better appreciate the local interest’ (Canto 2), he is identifying local readers as privileged – those who can ‘appreciate’ the text – but
            also underlining the imagined metropolitan reader’s lack of access to the sights and events of the colony. </p>
                  <p>The reviewer’s other function is to signpost the text’s operation as a roman à clef, where not only the two protagonists, but also some
            of the incidental characters, are recognizable portraits of individuals. This level of coding is generally inaccessible now, as the time
            elapsed since publication renders indecipherable the highly-coloured depictions of characters such as Pomponious the surveyor, Babille, or
            the gruesome married couple Janet and Peter. It is nonetheless clear that episodes such as the Griffin’s encounter with ‘a friend of his
            father’s’, whose ungenerous refusal of notice or hospitality is a dismaying introduction to Bombay, are to be read, contra the reviewer’s
            sarcastic protests, as real-life representations: ‘the outline of this personage is greatly overdrawn and we trust that no one sat for the
            horrid likeness’.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn36" n="36">

                  <p>This theme of material and experiential distance between metropolitan and colonial reader is maintained throughout the work. The cascade
            of visual descriptors in the descriptions of landscape – ‘azure mist’, ‘radiant glory’, ‘golden light’ – creates the highly-coloured sheen
            of the picturesque familiar to readers of travel-writing and poetry from India, but it is mixed with the listing of place-names and
            landmarks familiar only to local residents, setting lived experience of India in tension with the metropolitan-facing consumerist vision
            of the colonial picturesque.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn37" n="37">

                Writing and India, 1600-1920: Colonizing Aesthetics</title> (London: Routledge, 2008). </note> The reviewer’s listing of ‘the
            Heathenish names of Parbuttee, Gunness-Kund, Singhur and Paishaunee’, highlights their strangeness to a metropolitan eye, but to local
            readers, these are regional landmarks, familiar as locations associated with the battle of Kirkee and the wider campaign by which the East
            India Company attained control over the Deccan territories. Colonial readers’ acquaintance with these temporally, politically and
            geographically specific locations sets them both apart from and (in terms of knowledge and cultural capital) above their counterparts of
            the metropolis. Similarly, the scene before the battle of Kirkee, in Canto 2 of <title level="m">The Griffin</title>, acknowledges a
            moment of colonial dependence on the metropolis in Morris’s open imitation of Byron’s <title level="m">Childe Harold</title>, but the
            battle also signals for the readers of Bombay their own assertion of dominance in India, chronicled in a text prioritising the agenda of
            the colony. In this way, Morris reverses the polarity of some of the basic literary and political relationships of the Romantic period,
            contesting the increasingly hegemonic role of publications such as the <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title> in policing the
            boundaries of literature, and engaging in the creative appropriation of metropolitan literary forms to give voice to specifically colonial
            and anti-metropolitan concerns. </p>

                  <p>Morris was a wide reader with an excellent knowledge of poetry and fiction, as well as a magpie eclecticism and a confident willingness
            to adapt – he was happy, for example, to take one line of Walter Scott’s on a mythological hero’s death from a review of Southey’s work,
            and transform the dying message to a beloved wife into a declaration of love for someone who has just been discovered to be the wife of
            someone else.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn38" n="38"> See ‘’Twas Noon’, note 4. Morris’s inexact references suggest a practice of relying
              on memory: his quotation of John Campbell, for example, substitutes ‘glitter’d’ for ‘shone’ and ‘people’ for ‘other animals’ (Canto 6,
              note 145).</note> Similarly, the epigraph from Scott’s <title level="m">Legend of Montrose </title>that precedes the full text of ‘An
            Eastern Vision’ (not given here) is adapted to be voiced by a man in relation to a woman, rather than the original where the reverse is
            the case: ‘But parted by severe decree, / Far different must our fortunes prove, / May thine be Joy – enough for me, / To weep and pray
            for her I love.’<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn39" n="39"> Compare Walter Scott, <title level="m">A Legend of the Wars of Montrose</title>,

With the
            invocation of John Suckling in the correspondence, the literary network evolved by Morris (whether regarded as his own work or achieved in
            partnership with his readers) stretches back to the seventeenth century.</p>
                  <p>The most significant link in that network of connection between metropolis and colony, Byron, and especially his best-known work, <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, provides the impetus for <title level="m">The Griffin</title>. There are also references to <title level="m">Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage </title>throughout the text – the identification of the author with his protagonist, the night of revelry
            before a battle, several direct allusions to the text – but the direct claim of <title level="m">Don Juan</title> as a model in the
            opening lines, and the romantic escapades of its protagonist, ensure that the latter forms the lens through which its first readers saw

            of British India has long been recognized, since David Kopf credited the appearance of <title level="m">Don Juan </title>in the <title level="j">Calcutta Gazette</title> in the early days of 1820 with being the inspiration for a generation of poetic satirists who used
            the form of Byron’s most spectacular work to chronicle the lives of hapless East India Company protagonists, and mount a comic attack on

            notable, though less well documented; it appears in the periodicals of Bombay in forms ranging from the publication of Byronic imitations

              race meeting (signed by T.D. Morris as secretary), <title level="j">Bombay Courier</title> 26 February 1820. The supposed ‘Canto III’ of
                <title level="j">Don Juan</title> published in the <title level="j">Bombay Gazette</title> issues of 26 April and 3 May 1820, copied
              from the <title level="j">Calcutta Journal</title>, is not by Byron, but is the work entitled <title level="m">Don Juan: With a

              Byron’s life. Notwithstanding its inauthenticity, it further demonstrates the local interest in Byron’s work, and the availability of
              the Byronic hero as a model for colonial writers. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In some respects, the appearance of <title level="m">The Griffin</title> fits well into this narrative of Byronic originary force. Morris
            had been publishing short works exploring the bitter aftermath of rejection in the years immediately preceding the publication of <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, producing a repetitive series of lyric verses focusing on the protagonist’s emotional response to his
            lover’s betrayal. The series of fragments hints at a larger narrative, but none such is forthcoming. The arrival in India of <title level="m">Don Juan</title> Cantos I and II might be regarded as a turning-point: in August 1820, the first canto of <title level="m">The
              Griffin</title> makes its appearance, complete with a Byronic protagonist, a narrative of that protagonist’s progress through Bombay
            society, and a narrative voice and style which consciously and deliberately echoes Byron’s <foreign>ottava rima</foreign>, his tone and
            his flamboyant rhymes. The acknowledgement of <title level="m">Don Juan</title> in the opening paragraph is all but superfluous.</p>
                  <p>To read <title level="m">Don Juan</title> as a determining force in relation to <title level="m">The Griffin</title> is, however, to
            overlook several important aspects of the work and its composition. Morris’s fictional construct, with its series of embedded narrative
            structures, the inbuilt commentary of the review element, and the (probable) accompaniment of the readers’ chorus of the correspondence,
            draws on a wider and older tradition than that represented simply by Byron’s work. The device of a long narrative poem with prose
            interludes had been popularized by Thomas Moore’s <title level="m">Lalla Rookh</title>, invoked by Morris in <title level="m">The
              Griffin</title> (Canto 5). Samuel Richardson’s multi-vocal epistolary novels, with their insistence on deferral of readerly judgement,
            are invoked in both poem and correspondence, enabling Morris to frame the self-centred lyric lines about Daric’s plight within a construct
            of distancing and sceptical narrative.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn43" n="43"> Richardson’s heroine Pamela is called into readerly memory
              by her namesake and mirror image in <title level="m">The Griffin</title> (Canto 4, ll. 251-305); his <title level="m">Clarissa</title>
              by the correspondence (see the letter of ‘Anna Howe’ in this edition). </note> The use of the review article format echoes the
            centrality of reviews to the process of reading and reception of the early nineteenth century, at a time when the <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title> was reaching a circulation of 13,000, and (as Morris’s own reading of Southey through Walter Scott’s review
            suggests) providing a window onto contemporary literature for more readers than would encounter the original works.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn44" n="44"> See Early Poems, n. 5. </note> If Byron supplied the form and tone and inflected the content for ‘The Griffin’
            as poetry, the larger review / poem was shaped by the eighteenth-century and Romantic tradition of critical engagement with creative
            writing and use of multi-narrator forms to explore and create critical distance from a topic, transforming lyric into satire. </p>

                  <head>Morris and the evolution of a colonial literary tradition</head>
                  <p>In the moment of 1820, <title level="m">The Griffin</title> caught the attention of Bombay, and Morris continued to be sought after as a
            poet and comic essayist, dominating the columns of the <title level="j">Oriental Sporting Magazine</title> (1828-1833) over the course of
            its publication.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn45" n="45"> See the list of ‘Additional Works’; even before the advent of the
                <emph>OSM</emph>, the unusual response from the editor of the <title level="j">Bombay Gazette</title> to the submission of ‘An Eastern
              Vision’ – a note that future contributions ‘will be always acceptable’ (5 April 1820) – suggests that Morris’s work was valued above
              that of other contributors.</note> Its longer term influence, and especially the extent to which it might be said to contribute to a
            distinctively colonial literary tradition, is more open to question. It may be helpful here to distinguish between the formal aspects of
            Morris’s work – the playful, multivocal texts where content is nuanced through layers of narrative – and the subject-matter, particularly
            as that pertains to the concerns and lived experience of British residents in India. On this latter point, there is evidence in the
            periodical record to suggest that Morris’s work, particularly the sporting texts of the <title level="j">Oriental Sporting
              Magazine</title>, came to exemplify for readers a golden age of Britain in India, or at least a golden age for British officers of the
            East India Company, who enjoyed a degree of freedom, autonomy and leisure to follow their own pursuits unattainable for their successors.
            This is the message of a writer for the <title level="j">Times of India</title> in the 1890s, who sums up his nostalgic retrospective in
            the remark that ‘There were more hogs in these days’.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn46" n="46"> ‘Sport and Song in the Bombay Presidency,

            another Bombay writer, ‘Ram Bux’, exemplifies the alienation felt by British colonizers in the light of a nascent Indian movement towards

                  <p>On literary form, the legacy of Morris’s work is less visible. There are some traces observable in the years following publication of
              <title level="m">The Griffin</title>, in the appearance of other texts in the Bombay papers which replicate some of its narrative
            devices. The conceit of a found poem is echoed in ‘Hot blow the winds….’ (1822), an account of a soldier’s life, where the lines are
            prefaced by a paragraph describing the circumstances of its acquisition: ‘The enclosed was picked from the <emph>debris</emph> of a devil
            of no common powers, which spread uproar and confusion through our lines this forenoon. From the handwriting I suspect it to be the

            style on the intersection of material and poetic form: ‘You will perceive a <emph>hiatus</emph>, or hole in the ballad just before the

                  <p>Despite these early signs of an evolving literary tradition, the conditions of publication in Bombay, as elsewhere in India, were not

            identifiable work lasting sometimes a year or two and then fading as the authors died, were transferred, or lost interest.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn54" n="54"> In the <title level="j">Bombay Oriental News</title>, for example, the poetry columns for 1853 are
              largely filled by the contributions of two authors, W.A. Shepherd of Colaba and the pseudonymous ‘Ada’. By the following year, ‘Ada’ is
              seen no longer, and Shepherd’s contributions cease in June 1854, after which the volume of poetry in the periodical dwindles to
              insignificant proportions until 1857. </note> Though <title level="m">The Griffin</title> continued to be fondly, if inaccurately,
            recollected (see above), the ephemerality of local print culture, and the weight of metropolitan literature which continued to be
            preferred in the colonial marketplace, militated against any more lasting impact Morris’s work might have had on the literary tradition of
              Bombay.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn55" n="55"> The relative value of metropolitan versus local literature is demonstrated by the
              editor of the <title level="j">Bombay Courier</title>, whose note to correspondents explains that the contributions of a local author,
              ‘Senrub’, have been ‘laid aside to make room for our English files. When they are exhausted we will return to … his verses’ (2 May
              1829). </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>With the partial exception of the hunting songs, Morris’s work has remained largely unread during the period of almost two hundred years
            since his first verses to ‘C—B—’ appeared in a Bombay newspaper. The ephemeral nature of the periodical press of the time, and the fact
            that Morris (unlike many of his contemporaries) chose to eschew any form of collection or book publication of his works, contributed to
            their neglect. The nature of the texts – their focus on personal circumstances and stories, and their close ties to the time and place of
            their composition – also make them resistant to easy retrieval or decoding. They are, however, important witnesses to the literary
            concerns and strategies of a largely overlooked British India. Morris, like his contemporary writers in Bombay and the other regional
            centres of India, was geographically and culturally distant from the main colonial literary scene of Calcutta, as well as from the British
            centre. Separated by class as well as by education from the elite scholars of the late eighteenth century, they did not have access to the
            transoceanic and transcultural networks commanded by William Jones and his colleagues, or their knowledge of Oriental languages and
            literatures. Culturally and professionally circumscribed by the narrow society of military and sporting Bombay, the colonial literary
            networks developed by Morris and his readers and co-writers in the <title level="j">Oriental Sporting Magazine </title>bear no comparison
            to those of 1830s Calcutta, where H.L.V. Derozio, David Lester Richardson, Emma Roberts, Kasiprasad Ghosh and others developed a rich,
            though transient, set of collaborative and mutually influential cross-cultural relationships.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn56" n="56">
              These relationships are discussed in Gibson, <title level="m">Indian Angles</title>; Rosinka Chaudhuri, <title level="m">Gentlemen Poets
                in Colonial Bengal: Emergent Nationalism and the Orientalist Project</title> (Calcutta: Seagull, 2002). </note> Morris’s idiosyncratic
            vision and irreverent focus on the personal and the frivolous also sets him apart from his mainstream contemporaries. Nonetheless, Morris
            is not wholly or only a derivative writer: his repurposing of available literary models, his centering of colonial lived experience and
            world-view, and his resourceful ability to counter the preoccupations and concerns of the metropolis position him as in control of, rather
            than dependent upon, contemporary cultural forms. His writing privileges the local, the parochial and the parodic, but it also illuminates
            aspects of the complex relationships of dependence and transformation between the metropolis, the colony and the individuals whose lives
            and works spanned the distance between them. </p>

                     <p rend="noCount">The Work which we are about to review is reported to be the maiden effort of an Indian Subaltern’s Muse, written during
            the many hours of Solitude and Idleness incident to a Soldier’s life, and under the depression of much mental affliction. We did not
            therefore look for much erudition – indeed the nature of the Work precluded such a hope – but we expected much amusement, some novelty and
            some faults, nor have our critical expectations been disappointed, for we found many laughable anecdotes, many new scenes and situations
            and many errors. It is written in burlesque imitation (if we may use such a phrase when the thing burlesqued is in itself a Burlesque) of
            Lord Byron’s witty yet shamelessly indecent Don Juan; void of all its richest beauties and destitute also of its licentiousness and
            depravity. It purposes to relate the life and adventures of a youth sent out to India as a Cadet for the Infantry. We had seated ourselves
            by a comfortable fire-side, drawn close the window curtains and “while the Bubbling and loud hissing Urn sent up its steamy column,”
            prepared ourselves for judgment on “The Griffin.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> An imperfect recollection of
              Cowper’s ‘The Winter Evening’: ‘And while the bubbling and loud-hissing urn / Throws up a steamy column’ (William Cowper, <title level="m">The Task: A Poem in Six Books</title> (London, 1785), p. 139). </note> We confess we were somewhat startled at the
            horrifying title under which it has been ushered into the world, and in some vexation of spirit, looked for a tale of German Horrors, a
            tissue of deaths heads and blue lights, groans and hollow voices, worms creeping in and worms creeping out, bleeding ghosts, seven-feet
            monks, gore-stained daggers and bowls of poison, but from this apprehension we were relieved by an old Indian Friend and Co-Critic, who
            anticipating splendid descriptions of Rajahs, Nawabs, golden Musnuds,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Thrones or
              seats made of cushions.</note> jewel’d turbands, houdah’d Elephants, Tigers and Tyfa’s,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The
              word is uncommon; probably ‘taif’, a ghost.</note> pecks of Pagodos<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Gold
              coins.</note> and lacks of Rupees,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> A lakh is equivalent to one hundred thousand.
            </note> earnestly requested us to commence our labours and assured us that a Griffin was not “the fearful wild fowl,” we had imagined but
            merely a <foreign>nom de guerre</foreign> given to any European adventurer until he has passed one year of probation in the climate of the
            East.</p>
                     <p rend="noCount">Upon a production of the nature now before us, we would willingly be as little severe as our imperative duty to our
            Readers will permit, and though the lash might often have been bestowed, for the most palpable carelessness and want of reflection, we
            would have spared the rod altogether had we not been shocked by the most ridiculous anachronisms; in some places and the most servile
            imitation, in others, the want of unity thro’ out, and above all by the most unpardonable language in which the Author has attempted to
            degrade the loveliest part of Creation. That he has written these calumnies from the heart we cannot believe, and while we render this
            justice to his better feelings, we would warn him of his want of common benevolence, and pity the disposition that could be so palpable,
            so miserably prejudiced by the impulse of the moment. That there are some females even in India whose turpitude of conduct render them
            objects of loathing and disgust to every virtuous mind, we are not prepared to deny – but in the general Women (and particularly British
            Women) whether shivering in the Icy regions of the North or wasting their bloom in the land of the Sun, whether floating on the sea of
            affluence or stemming the rude tide of poverty, in the zenith of joy, or in the day of agony, in the pomp of Vigor, or in the hour of
            Death, twine round the stubborn heart of “Lordly Man,” the object of his purest passions, the sharers of his prosperity and distress, the
            partakers of his joy and his pain, rendering his toils a pleasure, his life a blessing and his home a Heaven!! We trust our readers will
            forgive us for thus trespassing the honest burst of our feelings upon their patience, but we are sure that every one who peruses that
            portion of the book we allude to, will join with us in condemning the acrimony which the Author has so wantonly evinced towards those whom
            he should have considered it his duty to have treated with kindness and his pride to have protected from insult. We trust this lecture
            will shew him the cruelty and malevolence of his conduct and should it awake in him those pangs of remorse which lead to reparation we
            shall not reget the trouble we have now taken “to probe and cure the Canker in his heart.” In the hope that such may be the effect of our
            animadversions we now proceed to the more pleasing part of our duty, that of bestowing praise, and in doing this, we will give our readers
            an outline of the story and occasional extracts that has struck us as deserving of approbation. The Poem commences with the following: – </p>

            all Matrimonial controversies, a few tears from the Mother gains the day. </p>

            brings us to the day of his departure from town, and in our opinion beautifully describes the feelings of the youth immediately previous
            to quitting his home. We have only room for the burst of grief with which he commences it, and we pity the Man, who has ever been
            similarly situated without experiencing similar sensations. </p>

            disposition to have become abstracted, gloomy and discontented, evincing much mental disquietude, much restlessness of body and great
            depression of spirits. We are in the dark about the cause of this for several pages, until the author flashes conviction of his
            predicament upon us in his own abrupt and <foreign>outre</foreign> manner. We heard little of the different personages who form the family
            groupe, except in general terms of praise, and little suspected that the God of the unerring Bow had been wreaking his blind Vengeance on
            the heart of our hero but so it proves. – His first acknowledgment of Love to the object of his affections (who by the bye is a married
            woman) is thus described at least as far as we <emph>dare</emph> give it.</p>

                  <p rend="noCount">That we may not make this extraordinary tale, appear more unconnected than it really is (and that to a very considerable
            degree) we must apprize the Reader, that “the Griffin” after wandering over the field of battle (alluding to the Victory of Kirkee) writes
            an account of <emph>it</emph> and his feelings on the occasion to his friends, and here the Poet has made a sad jumble of the ideas that
              <emph>then</emph> pressed upon his mind and his <emph>subsequent</emph> reflections, for while he is scribbling to his relatives about
            the Action he tells them that it is Early Day and that his “favorite Planet is alone shining upon” him, and <emph>then</emph> likens it to
            the “false Beacon” that <emph>ultimately</emph> deluded him, this is one of the many inadvertencies with which the Poem abounds, but his
            lines on the occasion are forcible, and deserve approbation. Alluding to the Morning Star “shining singly in the dark vault of heaven” and
            growing “paler and yet more pale” until at last extinguished by the rising Sun, he says.</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>So, mid the darkness of misfortune’s night</l>
                     <l>The Phantom star of Hope shines doubly bright</l>
                     <l>Unchilled by coming danger – still its ray,</l>
                     <l>Gleams in the troubled breast, doubt and dismay,</l>
                     <l>Glide o’er it shadowless – till truth’s broad glare</l>
                     <l>Dims its last weakling, fitful gleam</l>
                     <l>And thus yon ling’ring planet, melts in air</l>
                     <l>Quench’d by the God of light’s resistless beam!</l>
                     <l>So ’mid the fullness of Hope’s warmest dream</l>
                     <l>Conviction dashed me darkling into sorrow’s stream!!</l>

                  <p rend="noCount"> We strongly disapprove of this change of Metre and altho’ it may have been a relief to the Author, which he has taken
            advantage of the Griffin’s letter to introduce yet (if we may be allowed the Expression) it breaks the <emph>Rhythm</emph> of our feelings
            – it puts us out of the beaten path upon which we had so long travelled – it is like getting into a shuffling trot after a delightful
            canter, it actually made our Indian Co-critic change his position, by taking one foot from the Fender, and throwing his right leg over his
            left; this was a grievance for a gouty man – he felt it and was for some time sorely displeased with the Author – tho’ we pointed out to
            him that the lines were good &amp; many of them exceedingly energetic, as we proved to him in the continuation of the Epistle. – The
            following passage is well wrought up, it describes the battle-ground – which</p>

                     <l>In ghastly heaps lay friend and foe together – </l>

                     <l>The mutilated corpse, the shattered limb,</l>
                     <l>The writhing warrior; the expiring steed</l>
                     <l>The bloodless dead, the bleeding left to bleed –</l>
                     <l>The gaudy trappings of the Lordly slain</l>
                     <l>The humbler vestments of their faithful train –</l>

                  <p rend="noCount">But as we disapprove almost as much as our friend of this variegated metre in a regular Poem we shall not quote further
            from this letter but proceed to what are deemed by far the most interesting and best written portion of the Book, it is the whole account
            of his <emph>Entanglement</emph> with the chosen mistress of his soul, it breathes throughout an impassioned tenderness, a voluptuousness
            of feeling, a luxuriance and glowing richness of imagery, at the same time mingled with such paroxysms of mental agony and suffering, that
            remind us forcibly of the chastened elegance and fancy of Moore, the saddening touches of Montgomery, the love-breathing tenderness of
            Campbell, and the fearful sublimity and pathos of Lord Byron.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas Moore
              (1779-1852), whose <title level="m">Irish Melodies</title> provided the models for some of Morris’s hunting poems in the <title level="j">Oriental Sporting Magazine</title>; James Montgomery (1771-1854), a poet and writer of hymns; Thomas Campbell (1777-1844), a
              poet best known for his long poem <title level="m">The Pleasures of Hope</title> (1799); George Gordon, Lord Byron (1788-1824), whose

              served as source-texts for aspects of ‘The Griffin’. </note> After this we have found great difficulty in withstanding the temptation of
            giving the whole of this beautiful epistle, but it has been suggested to us that by this copiously extracting the sweets of the Book, we
            are not acting with that justice to the sale of the Work, which we are most anxious to do, and therefore we will content ourselves here by
            giving our readers two of his little sonnets;<note place="foot" resp="editors"> This word appears clearly in the

            and only sonnet for which we can now afford room is a beautiful thing. We know not how any one could have written with such feeling and
            force without having experienced the agony it depicts, it looks too much like reality, too like the disappointment of Juvenile passion,
            for fiction, and appears to have been composed while the heart was actually, bleeding from the effects of the scene described. In an
            unguarded moment Carineth (who is the Lady in question) had consented to an interview with the Griffin when all the family had retired to
            rest. The day proceeding, he had found means to communicate to her that an invincible obstacle prevented their Union, but its nature is
            not very clear it leads however to their separation immediately after this midnight assignation, the issue of which we are obliged to
            guess at, from this beautiful delineation of early impressions.</p>

                / On woman, and attend her sov’reign pleasure!’ (18). Tricked by him into believing that he has married under false pretences, and is
                without rank or means, she agrees to abide with him for a month in poverty, and thereby undergoes a ‘metamorphosis’, coming to believe
                that ‘modesty, in deed, in word, and thought, / Is the prime grace of woman; and with that, / More than by frowning looks and saucy
                speeches, / She may persuade the man that rightly loves her; / Whom she was ne’er intended to command’ (71). </note>

                feathers / To wave as streamers to your vanity – / Nor cumbrous silk, that, with its rustling sound, / Makes proud the flesh that
                bears it. She’s adorn’d / Amply, that in her husband’s eye looks lovely – / The truest mirror that an honest wife / Can see her beauty

              occasionally in the <emph xml:space="preserve">Bombay Gazette </emph>in 1818-1819: a full list is given in the Bibliography.
              While the first seems to be a serious discussion of religious faith among the British in India, the column quickly took on a knowing
              tone and a satiric approach to subjects including the Bombay theatre (IX and XI), the qualities required for success in India (VI,
              XIII), the means necessary for those returning to Britain to live adequately (III, V), ladies’ fashions (IV), and letters from
              correspondents speculating on the identity and circumstances of the ‘Observer’ himself. Numbers IV and X are of particular interest in
              the context of <emph>The Griffin</emph>’s anti-feminism, as both introduce letters from supposed female correspondents
              preoccupied with appearance and with the prospect of a lucrative marriage. Eliza Scanty comes out to India ‘with an entire new Wardrobe
              of the latest fashions’, thinking ‘of nothing else on the voyage but the pleasure of exhibiting my person (which by the bye I think a
              very tolerable one) to the greatest advantage’; and targets the ‘Observer’ with flirtatious remarks: ‘I am sure you are a Civilian, and
              I would lay a bet you are young and handsome’ (IV). The letter from ‘Curvilia’ reinforces <emph>The Griffin</emph>’s focus on
              sexualized female bodies: ‘I have been three years in India, and when I first arrived, what with tight lacing, the stocks, and the
              backboard I landed as upright as possible. Though I had lots of fishes at my hook, and plenty of nibbles, yet my erect manner gained me
              but one bite and that was from an elderly <emph xml:space="preserve">Cadet </emph>whom I civilly rejected[.] The Civilians
              said I was as stiff as a poker, and the military swore I had swallowed a ramrod, how vulgar! I was rather pretty, rather genteel, rather
              accomplished and rather amiable, yet still somehow I was rather single, and time threatened to leave me withering on the Virgin thorn,
              but taking example from several Girls, who by greater pliability of back and greater exposure to <emph>squinting eyes</emph>
              &amp; <emph>nightly colds</emph>, most surprisingly soon enjoyed the sweets of wedlock. I resolved to <emph>bend</emph> to circumstances and shall still continue in spite of Mr. Observer, or his Dandy friend “to stoop to Conquer”’ (X).

                     <p rend="noCount">A certain Presidency, Mr. Observer, swarms with these unlicensed railers at Matrimony. A lecture from your pen might prove of service to
          them, by shewing their ill-natured propensity in its true light. I am a married man, and, since my arrival in India, I have seldom mixed in
          society without having my mind put into a state of irritability from the unvaried and constant allusion to the <emph>horrors</emph> of <emph>Wedlock</emph>, which is ever reviled as a state of strife and bondage. You must, I am sure, be well
          aware of the happiness and respectability of a married life, and will, I trust, point out the ill-nature, aye, and the ill-breeding of

                        <l>With paly lip and cheek and bosom glistening with dew.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg>
                        <l>And to my arms she sprung and panted,</l>
                        <l>Quick as the new-caught Cushat Dove,</l>
                        <l>And, o’er her as I hung enchanted,</l>
                        <l>I whisper’d – “Fly with me my love:</l>
                        <l>With me to live with me to die,</l>
                        <l>In Love’s unshackled Liberty”!</l>
                        <l>Her bosom rose with hastier swell,</l>
                        <l>As if in agony it rose and fell,</l>
                        <l>Like the waves of stormy ocean!</l>
                        <l>Trembling she gasped in wild emotion.</l>
                        <l>And “Cease,” she said “is this thy faith, could <emph xml:space="preserve">you </emph>ensnare me.</l>
                        <l>“Not <emph>thus</emph>, clasp me not <emph>thus</emph>, Oh God! in pity, spare me!!”</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Alone she stood her tears fast falling,</l>
                        <l>In Joy’s wild flow, bedew’d the sod.</l>
                        <l>For from a trial so appalling,</l>
                        <l>
                           <emph>Spotless</emph> she stood! I thank my God!!</l>
                        <l>There was but <emph>one</emph> cloud in the sky,</l>
                        <l>And it was white as maidens breast,</l>
                        <l>On the Cold Moon! she raised her eye,</l>
                        <l>And whilst her soft warm lip I press’d,</l>
                        <l>“Yon solitary cloud” she said.</l>
                        <l>(And as she spoke, my bosom bled),</l>
                        <l>Yon snowy cloud pure tho’ it be,</l>
                        <l>Emblems my fault my frailty,</l>
                        <l>My ev’ry act and thought ‘till this clandestine meeting given.</l>
                        <l>Were holy, calm and passionless and pure as cloudless heaven!</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg>
                        <l>She speaks not now – again she spoke not,</l>
                        <l>But prone to Earth in Death she fell,</l>
                        <l>My heart’s throb ceased but yet it broke not!</l>
                        <l>Without a groan I gazed – A spell,</l>
                        <l>Bound every sense, save sight alone,</l>
                        <l>I was a bloodless, tearless stone!</l>
                        <l>The cloud sailed past the Moon, whose ray, </l>
                        <l>Fell on her bosom as she lay.</l>
                        <l>Methought it heav’d! it heav’d by Heaven! could Fate such bosoms sever.</l>
                        <l>She <emph>rose!</emph> – One kiss! one last embrace!! we parted then for ever!!!</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg>
                        <l>‘T was in this very path I met her,</l>

                        <l>And oh! if ever I forget her,</l>
                        <l>May ev’ry hope of future good,</l>
                        <l>Of Bliss hereafter – Fortune, Fame,</l>

                        <l>Fade from my grasp, as shadows flee;</l>
                        <l>May Life’s dull cup be filled by thee.</l>
                        <l>Thou loved one of my soul! and let each deeper draught contain.</l>
                        <l>The bitterest Dregs of Misery and agonizing pain!</l>

               <p rend="noCount">[This essay offers a vision of marriage from the point of view of the wife’s abandoned lover. The narrator is a ‘grey headed
          sage’, who tells his ‘enthusiastic pupil’ about the last in a list of ‘dangers and temptations’ he must guard against: ‘This idle pageant of an
          hour, this airy vision of the Boy, this day-dream of the Maid, this Utopian heaven of the old and young, the ugly and the beautiful is called
          “<hi rendition="#smallcaps">Wedlock</hi>”’. The allegory that follows describes the struggles of those who journey towards the ‘<hi rendition="#smallcaps">Temple of Matrimony’</hi> in search of <hi rendition="#smallcaps">‘Wedded Bliss’</hi>, of whom ‘scarce two in a million arrived at the Altar’,
          while ‘the other miserable wretches lay gasping in the dust by the road side’. The visionary is drawn to one couple in particular, who though
          ‘both in the bloom of Youth and health’ are moving ‘confusedly and in silence’; he is indifferent, she is veering between ‘impetuosity’ and
          movements ‘irresolute and almost inclining to retrograde’. The vision continues:]</p>

          threshold of the Porch, she stopped, turned pale as death, and cast her eyes to Heaven with such an imploring action that I felt deeply
          interested for her. Again she moved onwards and now had placed one foot on the steps of the Altar, when throwing a fitful Glance towards the
          right hand boundary, her face flushed deeply, then assumed a deadly hue until overcome with excessive emotion she sunk senseless to the ground.
          Following the direction her eyes had taken, I perceived behind the shrubs a young Man in an attitude of the deepest despair, in his hand he
          grasped a faded myrtle bough and a lock of dark glossy hair his grief appeared too great for utterance his impassioned gaze was intently fixed
          upon the fallen female, in the bitterness of his agony he dashed himself on the ground and tore the hair from his head, his bosom heaved almost
          to bursting. I felt as if I could hear every throb of his bleeding heart; with the most fretful impatience, he sprang from the Earth and
          strained his eye balls towards a great road which led from the West as if expecting the approach of some one. In the mean time the Bridegroom
          had raised the maid from the ground, who soon after opened her eyes and with fear and agitation slowly turned them to the spot where the Youth
          was still standing, their eyes met both burst into tears, she then turned as if to retrace her steps, this caused a gleam of hope to brighten up
          his emaciated countenance, he turned to the West. A figure appeared at a distance, he knelt in gratitude, his emotion seemed to chain him to the
          spot; at length he rushed to the messenger, seized a packet, opened it, uttered a scream of joy and with one bound was at the edge of the
          fearful Barrier with maddening impatience he made a desperate leap at the impediment, but whilst in the Air and before he reached the opposite
          bank, his lynx-like eye caught sight of the Mystic <emph>Ring</emph> glittering on the finger of the maid, and as his feet touched the ground, I
          saw his heart was broken, he uttered a shriek of wild and frantic agony, and fell back into the Abyss, a victim to the rashness and inconstancy
          of the first Maiden he had loved! The impetuosity with which I endeavoured to rush forward and save the unfortunate Youth, awoke me from the
          sleep into which I had fallen. The Vision faded away, the cool breeze of twilight refreshed me, my eye lids were yet moist with the tears I had
          shed in my slumber, and just as the faintest glow of the summer Sun had vanished from the West, I rose from my knotty seat and whilst returning
          slowly to my humble cottage I reflected that such had been the fate of many a warm hearted Youth, who relying upon the virgin-vows of some
          impatient female, obey’d the calls of Duty and Honour and returned to the object of his Adoration <emph>time enough</emph> to find her. </p>

                  <p rend="noCount">Perhaps you will have the goodness to assist me in giving information to a friend of mine at an outpost regarding the
            actual publication in England of a work lately printed in your Gazette under the title of the “Griffin”. Many doubts have arisen in the
            minds of my brother officers at this station as to such a book having ever issued from the English Press. Some imagine it to be the
            production of a Resident in this country and that <emph>you</emph> are reviewing it! Others (and to this opinion I also incline) that it
            is from the Pen of a young officer now at home; it is certainly a creditable performance be it whose it may and bears evident marks of
            much satirical genius. I admire your Critique upon it (if it is yours) and regret exceedingly that the interest of the Poem should have
            been weakened by being given at different periods. I hope you will not deem this an intrusion upon any wish for secresy you may possibly
            have, but I am really anxious as well as many others to purchase this extraordinary book if for sale, to see how he treats our friends at
            the presidency and what he says of <emph>our</emph> army during the last War. Pray then <hi rendition="#smallcaps">Mr. Editor</hi>,
            publish this letter as it may lead some of your Correspondents to assist in flashing conviction upon us; and your attending to this
            request in your next will really much oblige many of your readers as well as your obedient servant. </p>

                     <salute>To the Editor of the Bombay Courier,</salute>
                     <salute>Sir,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p rend="noCount">In the Bombay Gazettes of the 30<hi rendition="#superscript">th</hi> Aug. and 20<hi rendition="#superscript">th</hi>
            instant I have read the review of a work called “The Griffin.” The 2<hi rendition="#superscript">nd</hi> canto I have unfortunately not
            been able to procure a sight of – but I am told it is a shameless libel upon the ladies of this settlement in particular and of India in
            general – Be the author who he may, I trust this is not the case, that he has not been so deficient in principle, so void of all generous
            feelings as to attempt to throw obloquy upon a whole society. </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">I read the commencement of the review with some interest, as the critic there tells us it is the production of an Indian
            Subaltern’s muse; and anxious to see a spark of genius in a brother Exile and to derive amusement from something superior to the ephemeral
            Sonnets we are generally indulged with, I perused the Griffin with much attention, and I will add with encreasing interest, whether (I
            speak of as much only as I have read) the review or the Poem or both be the growth of England or India is immaterial, the former is ably
            written &amp; I applaud the sentiments of the critic highly.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">I do not feel capable of appreciating the merits of the Book, having missed seeing what is said to be the best part of it,
            viz, the 2<hi rendition="#superscript">nd</hi> Canto, but thus much I will say (&amp; it is on this account chiefly I have now troubled
            you) that situated as I am with ladies under my protection and many female friends in this place whom I esteem and regard, I most
            anxiously wish to know if the author of the Poem is actually in England or India, that should we find “The Chield amang us taking
              notes”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> ‘A chield’s amang you, taking notes, / And, faith, he’ll prent it’ (Robert Burns, ‘On
              the late Captain Grose’s Peregrinations through Scotland’, 1<hi rendition="#superscript">st</hi> pub. 1789,
              <emph xml:space="preserve">Selected Poems and </emph>Songs, ed. Robert P. Irvine (Oxford: Oxford UP, 2013), p. 201).</note> we may be
            more on our guard.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">I do not by this, wish to make your paper the vehicle of public or private animosities, but it strikes me, and it is the
            opinion of many of your readers, that a letter of this kind published by you, may set enquiries on foot and help to rid many of our wags,
            of the suspicions under which they at present labour.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">I mean nothing disrespectful to the Author of the Griffin – far from it – I applaud his genius – but I dislike his subject
            – and both my praise and censure are in the same ratio as I should feel inclined to bestow upon a well-drawn caricature, if I saw myself
            or any of my friends “shining in grim burlesque” among the ridiculous figures of the laughable group.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">I trust you will find a vacuum in your next paper for this letter, as I am convinced (and I have many reasons for the
            conviction) that it will draw forth an answer calculated to dispel the distrust with which I and some of my acquaintances now receive the
            visits of many young friends whom we deem capable of exercising their satirical talents with such effect – Oblige me therefore in this
            request, and allow me to subscribe myself your’s obediently. </p>

                  <p rend="noCount">Would it be an infringement of Editorial prerogatives if <emph>you</emph> were to give your readers a full and connected
            copy of the extraordinary work called “the Griffin.” We unfortunately have lost more than half of it and as it is our full determination
            to do all in our power to refute the charges he has so unprovokedly brought against all females in this country, I trust you will excuse
            this intrusion. A blush of Maiden modesty suffuses my cheeks while forming this Epistle, the first I ever wrote to one of the male sex,
            nor would I have had occasion to trespass upon the columns of your hebdomadal publication had not a female friend (a Matron, Sir) advised
            the proceeding. My <emph xml:space="preserve">chief </emph>motive in addressing <emph>you</emph> is to request that <emph>you</emph> will
            come forward in your public capacity and vindicate the reputations of Indian females from the foul aspersions cast upon them by the Author
            of the “Griffin.” Will you make him, Sir, uncloak himself? will you force him to give up his abominable name? Will you champion him to the
            utterance? Let not, Mr. Editor, this “Anguis in herbâ”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Snake in the grass.</note> poison the
            minds of those who are willing to look upon our Sex as the Angels of this world and their light to the next. Let not this hidden
            calumniator breathe his serpent venom on the fairest flowers of creation. Yet, Sir, if you are unwilling to undertake our cause, if you
            shrink from the task, at least grant us all the aid you can. We ask it from you as an Editor! We claim it from you as a man! Think not I
            write this from any personal feeling of pique or revenge. No Sir! I scorn it. I take up the cause, as the cause of all spinsters. I am
            myself in no danger of turning “Port Admiral” for I shall soon quit the country, I neither snatch at nor would I jump at any of the
            magnates of the Land, neither do I strain my Syren's voice or shew off my Vestris’ step to entrap a lover. I have a hand to dispose of
            ’tis true, and perhaps as soon as Malabar Point<note place="foot" resp="editors"> At the western edge of Bombay Harbour; if the

              determined to cut it up, she is a very learned woman and knows Latin and Greek, and to tell truth dictated the first part of this

              do not take in the Gazette, and only got a glimpse of it the other day from a friend who has since quitted the station, I have one or

              <emph>Carricature</emph> has been pressed into the service: – in vain our virtue triumphs over scurrility and scandal. Truth is bad
            enough sometimes, but as for scandal, who can describe it. – There is an abortive impotence, a want of soul, a turpitude in scurrility,
            which nothing can redeem, and whose necessary tendency to dissolution nothing can prevent. </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">I will fairly advocate the cause of my sex. We have been scandalized for

            without us the Company’s territories would very soon lose all their interest, dignity, &amp; attraction – all would become savage and

            honesty needs no disguise; let me ingeniously explain things as they are, at least so far as I am concerned. That I came out to India is
            certain; but that I came out <emph xml:space="preserve">for the express purpose </emph>of getting a husband is false. – that I might be

            all your Editorial sapiency and penetration, can you see any great harm in this candid confession? Now, Sir, I will go further, merely to
            satisfy you that it was not a <emph>desperate</emph> case with me, and that I might have married well enough at home if I had thought
            proper; but I was in no hurry I resolved to look about me a little; <emph>to see the world</emph>; and not to give my hand unadvisedly to
            the first idle fellow who chose, to dream that he was in love with me. </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">At fifteen Mama thought me sufficiently accomplished, and took me from school. A few weeks after my return home, a
              <emph>wine merchant</emph> who visited us occasionally, was the first who acknowledged the power of my charms, and had spirit to aspire
            to the honor of my hand. He applied in due form, Mama was favorable; he had what the world, terms an improving concern; but <emph>I said
              no</emph>, I don’t like the trade. Mr. Vintage fumed and sighed; but I thought he would perhaps ultimately have sighed a great deal
            more, had I been silly enough to grant him my hand without my heart; so sir the courtship dropt.</p>

              Dickens highlighted it with Mr Weller’s oft-repeated catchphrase ‘Wery good, Samivel’ in <emph>The Pickwick Papers</emph> (1837).</note>
            as he called them, that the fire of my eyes had carried all before it, that he was dying for me, and would not live without me, was a
            spruce <emph>half pay Ensign</emph> of a marching Regiment. But young as I was I prudently calculated that three shillings a day would not

            soul he appeared not a little enamoured, I made it a point implicity to obey Mama in a matter of so much importance, and as she declared
            herself decidedly hostile to the Ensign. A retreat was sounded, and he reluctantly raised the seige!</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">
                     <emph>A parson</emph>, with a decent living, was my third <emph>aspirant</emph>. His proposals were pious; he talked of
            the mosaic Law; and expatiated so devoutly, on the blessings of a house full of young children shooting up like vines around the table,
            that I really became alarmed at the hideous prospect, and assured the holyman, solemnly,
            <emph xml:space="preserve">I never would bury myself alive in his old parsonage house; </emph>for what with his host of children and blue
            devils, I should be tormented to death. And therefore I gravely declined the honor of his religious promise of eternal fidelity. The
            Priest did not tarry after this explanation; but he certainly bore his disappointment with somewhat more, resignation than was pleasing to
            my vanity. </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">After this a bumkin of a <emph>Country Squire</emph>, who chanced to see me at an assembly, thought proper to fall in love
            with me. He honored me with two or three <emph>amatory</emph> epistles, in which, after setting forth that “<emph>the coulter of affection
              had ploughed up his hart</emph>,” he made a mighty display of his genealogy, the number of his acres, his dogs, hogs and horses, besides
            the old family coach: – But as he was <emph>only</emph> sixty years of age, and appeared healthy and strong as Hercules, tho’ he now and
            then affected to sigh like a turtle, I resolved to decline the favor of his hand and all his worldly goods. Had he been only <emph>thirty
              years younger</emph>, or <emph>thirty years older</emph>, I really don’t know what I might have done; tho’ as it was, I could see no
              <emph>ground</emph> for the abundant <emph>harvest</emph> of connubial happiness which he seemed to anticipate. </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">I will not enumerate any more: but I must not forget to mention that my flame of an Ensign, who swore by the Furies
            <emph xml:space="preserve">that he could not </emph>live<emph xml:space="preserve"> without me</emph>, had the impudence to sign articles
            of alliance with my aunt, a buxom widow of fifty, after a short <emph>parley</emph>, of one week, (observe if you please Mr. Editor, the

                  <p rend="noCount">There was yet another reason which I forgot to tell you, tho’ certainly it gave me much umbrage at the time, and indeed

            against all <emph>ploughshares</emph> and <emph xml:space="preserve">harrows </emph>of <emph>love</emph>, and would not have him with all
            his genealogical tree and the rest of his gear, he had the assurance to appear angry: that I could have borne; but then he said insolently

                  <p rend="noCount">In yawning over the supplement of the last Courier (and by the bye that part of the Bombay Papers always make me yawn.) I
            had got to the middle of an old story about the Duke of Cumberland and Mrs. Horton,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The Duke of
              Cumberland, brother to George III, married Anne Horton, a commoner, in 1771. </note> when lo! at the bottom of the Page these words in
            Italics met my Eye. </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">
                     <emph>“To be continued after the poetry”</emph>. – Well to this Courier, baptized Poetry I turned and saw, what! not the
            usual productions of maudlin <emph>sonnetteers</emph>, but another Anathema on the devoted heads of the Griffin and others, by ANNA HOWE.
            She attacks the anonymous author of that above mentioned poem with all the invective and scurrility she can make use of, accusing, but
            hear the Gentle Anna let the Lady speak for herself, she calls the author “one who wars with Woman” “annoys the sex” “defames” “mocks
            merit and shames virtue” “abuses defenceless modesty” “assails private life” “corrupts enjoyment” his mind a chaos, himself a brute “very
            Lady-like language indeed” and now for her poetry she says that “in Bombay” captive (perhaps for Captains) hearts are bound and lick their
            chains – what delicacy what playful elegance – what poetical imagery – just fancy half a dozen hearts (bleeding ones of course)
            <emph xml:space="preserve">licking chains </emph>– Scene a Butchers shambles!! But to proceed, and listen Ladies to your champion!! Each
            sex for each continual ambush lay!! What married and single! Proh! Pudor!<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Oh! Propriety!
            </note> what is the meaning of this Miss Howe. Again – Maids to fulfil their <emph>End</emph> were born to wed!! Good! Good! my princess
            of Poetesses, but which end? fy! gentle Anna, fy! Miss Howe; then again at the unfortunate author “And where <emph>no</emph> Vices lurk,
            there <emph xml:space="preserve">only </emph>rails.” Well then, he must be a good natured satirist, but <emph>Eheu jam satis</emph>!<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Enough!</note> for would you believe it Mr. Editor, after all this abuse, after condemning his
            subject ridiculing his talents and affecting to despise his “puny stings.” She, the, Gentle Anna, acknowledges that the Griffin has gained
            his point, that the Day is won, he has not written in vain!! Well may he then exclaim in the words of the facetious Pindar “<emph>Euge
              Poeta magna</emph>
                     <note place="foot" resp="editors"> Hurrah for the great poet – the feminine ‘magna’ suggests that the subject
              is Anna Howe. Peter Pindar was the pseudonym of John Wolcot (1738-1819), satirist and poet. </note>
                     <emph>– well done Peter</emph>.” Now let me advise all your would-be wits – and can't-be Poets, who are thus continually intruding their
            trash upon the public thro the medium of the newspapers, to leave the author of the Griffin in the slumber to which he appears quietly to
            have betaken himself and to remember the old warning!! Never disturb a sleeping Dog. Either He or the Reviewer has allowed the Great and
            therefore Good folks of our island to escape almost scot-free from personalities yet with a remark (and I dislike that remark) hanging
            over them like the sword of Damocles suspended by a thread which the rude breath of abuse and invective may chance to snap, and if the
            weapon should fall twill make most tragical mirth “amongst them; for if I remember right in one part of the Review it is said that the
            inhabitants of Bombay” are almost individually characterized and with a freedom of touch and breadth of colour closely bordering on
            Caricature, what a poetical phantasmagoria may these Anna Howes occasion.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">Most of these works have been attributed to Morris on the evidence of the obituary published in the Calcutta

          editor of the <emph xml:space="preserve">Oriental Sporting Magazine. </emph>He described Morris as the ‘chief writer’ of the
            <emph>OSM</emph>, and lists among his contributions ‘the lively effusions of ‘S.Y.S.’, the ‘letters of John Dockeray’ [sic], the
            <emph>Tales of the Tinkers</emph>, the ‘Criticism of Stephen’, and ‘last but not least the numerous songs by the author of “<emph>The next
            Grey boar we see”</emph>’.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> ‘The Sportsman’, <emph>Englishman</emph>, 8 May 1835; J.H. Stocqueler,

          given in endnotes. This list is unlikely to be exhaustive: the <emph>OSM</emph> had other contributors, but they have not all been
          identified, and some items listed here as pseudonymous or anonymous may also be the work of Morris. </p>

              ‘Philo-Fun’) pseudonym is not included among Stocqueler’s list of Morris’s pseudonyms. The verses are clearly part of the ‘John Dockery’
              intertextual narrative. A work written under the pseudonym ‘Philo-Fun’ refers to ‘an excursion which in the year 1822 I made to the
              north of England’ while ‘being still very convalescent from “<emph>the liver,”</emph> which had sent me to England’ (1.451-452). These
              dates correspond with the period of sick leave Morris spent away from India in 1821-23, and may be considered to further support what
              remains a speculative attribution. </note> 1.258-259.</item>
