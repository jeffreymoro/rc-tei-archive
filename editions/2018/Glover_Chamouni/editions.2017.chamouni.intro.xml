          <p>In his widely-used <ref target="https://books.google.dk/books?id=Qug6AAAAcAAJ"><title level="m">Traveller’s Guide Through
                Switzerland</title></ref> (1818), Johann Gottfried Ebel (1764-1830) begins his account of ‘the valley of Chamouny’ by noting that it
            ‘is far distant from all high roads, isolated, and as it were separated from the rest of the world’.<note place="foot" resp="editors"
              xml:id="ftn2" n="2"> Johann Gottfried Ebel, <title level="m">A Traveller’s Guide Through Switzerland</title>, ed. Daniel Wall (London,
              1820) , p. 375</note> As Ebel’s discussion of Chamonix-Mont Blanc itself attests, however, the ostensibly remote location of the valley
            had not prevented it from becoming, by the end of the eighteenth century, one of the premier attractions of the European Grand Tour and a
            key site of enquiry in those branches of natural philosophy which would develop into geology and geomorphology. Indeed, Ebel himself
            estimates that ‘during 1780, and every successive year to 1792, from 800 to 1200 travellers resorted thither’, drawn by the spectacular
            glacial scenery and, of course, by Mont Blanc (4808 m): the highest mountain in Western Europe.<note place="foot" resp="editors"

              development of interest in the so-called ‘natural sublime’ during the eighteenth century and romantic period include: Marjorie Hope

              (London: Palgrave, 2013). For a more popular discussion of the growth of Alpine tourism during the same period, see: Jim Ring, <title
                level="m">How the English Made the Alps</title> (London: Murray, 2000).</note></p>
          <p>As many contemporary accounts, including <title level="m">Description</title>, observe, the ‘discovery’ of Chamonix-Mont Blanc was in the
            early nineteenth century generally attributed to two English travellers, William Windham (1717-61) and the celebrated Richard Pococke
            (1704-65), who mounted an expedition to the valley in June 1741. The extent to which Windham and Pococke were venturing into the unknown
            is evidenced by the fact that they went heavily armed and prepared to camp out rather than to risk staying with the locals, precautions
            which Windham urged subsequent travellers to repeat – and which, as Glover observes, seems to have made Windham’s party the butt of some
            enduring jokes amongst the native Savoyards. Windham described the expedition and its findings in his <title level="m">Account of the
              Glacieres or Ice Alps in Savoy, in Two Letters</title> (Ipswich, 1747). He provides there the earliest detailed observations of the Mer
            de Glace glacier, which a guidebook of 1816 would, almost a century later, identify as ‘infinitely better worth seeing’ than almost
            anything else at Chamonix, and where Victor Frankenstein and his creature would debate the creature’s right to a mate in <ref

              <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> (1818).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn4" n="4"> Henry Coxe, <ref

              1816), p. 38.</note></p>
          <p>Following Windham and Pococke’s lead, the next major expedition to the valley was led in the late 1760s by the Swiss traveller
            Marc-Théodore Bourrit (1739-1819), one of the pioneers of modern Alpinism, who conducted a much broader survey of the area than Windham
            and Pococke had done. Bourrit’s <title level="m" xml:space="preserve">Descriptions des Glacières de Savoye </title>(1773), which was
            translated into English as <ref target="https://books.google.dk/books?id=wbQ2AAAAMAAJ"><title level="m">A Relation of a Journey to the
                Glaciers in the Duchy of Savoy</title></ref> (1775, 1776), contained more than twenty illustrations by Bourrit himself and offered
            detailed descriptions of what would become, by Samuel Glover’s day, the key sites of the valley, including the Mer de Glace, the source of
            the Arveyron, the Brévent, and the Bossons glacier. The corrected English edition of 1776 featured on its nineteen-page list of
            subscribers influential cultural figures including Edmund Burke (1729-97), David Garrick (1717-79), Joshua Reynolds (1723-92), and Horace
            Walpole (1717-97).</p>
          <p>Bourrit’s <title level="m">Relation</title> also speculates about the possibility of an ascent of Mont Blanc, something which Bourrit
            tried and failed to do in 1785, 1786, and 1788. The honour of the first ascent was reserved for Jacques Balmat (1762-1834), a local guide
            and hunter, and Michel-Gabriel Paccard (1757-1827), a local doctor, who reached the summit on 8 August 1786 after Balmat had earlier
            discovered a practicable route: the circumstances of this discovery, widely-circulated in contemporary writing about Chamonix-Mont Blanc,
            are also described by Glover. The following year, the famous Swiss natural philosopher Horace-Bénédict de Saussure (1740-99), who had been
            trying to reach the summit since 1774, made a successful attempt, guided by Balmat, and published detailed accounts of his experiences in
            the fourth volume of his <ref

                1787</title></ref> (1788).</p>
          <p>As Ebel notes, it was the works of Bourrit and Saussure which ‘so forcibly drew public attention’ to Chamonix-Mont Blanc in the latter
            part of the eighteenth century.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn5" n="5"> Ebel, <title level="m">Traveller’s Guide</title>, p.
              376.</note> By 1819, however, the valley had been made the subject of a myriad of factual and fictitious treatments, in prose, verse and
            drama, including, of course, such now canonical responses as those by William Wordsworth (1770-1850) in <title level="m">Descriptive

            contemporary exhibition of models of the area by the Swiss modeller Jean-Baptiste Troye and to rebuff atheistic responses to the Alpine
            sublime, and those of Percy Shelley in particular. </p>

          <p><title level="m">A Description of the Valley of Chamouni, in Savoy</title> was printed in 1819 by Thomas Harvey, of 22 Great Surrey St.,
            Blackfriars, London. Attached to the inside of the front cover is a fold-out, two-page pencil sketch, presumably by Glover himself, but
            possibly by Jean-Baptiste Troye, of the view towards Mont Blanc from the northeast side of the valley. This sketch is not particularly
            accurate in point of detail, but the general outline is recognisable. A single copy of a second edition, ‘printed for the author’, and
            dated 1821, survives in the National Library of Scotland, Edinburgh. It was printed by C. Handy, 50 Brewer Street, Golden Square, London.
            It is identical in all respects to the edition of 1819 except that it lacks the fold-out pencil sketch. <figure>

            </figure> In the NLS copy, an unknown hand has written ‘Second Edition’ on the frontispiece and again on the title page. The same hand has
            altered, on the title page, ‘printed for the author’ to ‘printed for J. B. Troye’, and appended the address ‘No 8 Soho Square’. The date
            and provenance of these inscriptions it is impossible now to determine. It would seem reasonable to conclude that Troye was then resident
            at 8 Soho Square. The unknown hand could be either Glover’s or Troye’s, or that of some other person altogether. That no other copies of
            this ‘second edition’ are extant, and that it was produced by a different printer from the edition of 1819, raises the possibility that
            the NLS copy was a ‘one off’ rather than a second edition proper, printed either for Troye or at his request. On the basis of the
            available evidence (discussed later), the alteration to the title page is unlikely, I think, to be intended to signal that Troye
              <emph>was</emph> in fact the author and ‘Samuel Glover’ only a pseudonym – although the possibility cannot be ruled out that whoever
            made the inscription believed this to have been the case.</p>

        <div type="section">
          <head>*</head>
          <p><title level="m" xml:space="preserve">A Description </title>has three distinct parts: a preface, in which Glover attacks the rise of
            atheism; an account of the glacial outburst flood which devastated the Valley of Bagnes, near Chamonix-Mont Blanc, on 16 June 1818; and an
            account of Chamonix-Mont Blanc itself, which describes the main sites of the valley and an ascent to the summit of Mont Blanc. Throughout,
            the text is peppered with quotations from the Bible and from English literary sources, notably including John Milton’s (1608-74) <title
              level="m">Paradise Lost</title> (1667), Joseph Addison’s (1672-1719) <title level="m">Cato, a Tragedy</title> (1712), and James
            Thomson’s (1700-48) <title level="m">The Seasons</title> (1730). As will be apparent from the editorial notes, Glover is often liberal in
            his handling of these sources, extracting and actually rewording in some cases in order to increase the devotional tone. On occasion, and
            especially in his borrowings from Thomson’s <title level="m">Seasons</title>, Glover even goes so far as to splice together entirely
            unrelated parts of the original text in order to form a new composite quotation, more suited to his rhetorical purposes. This liberal use
            of quotation, together with Glover’s substantial reliance on unacknowledged sources (described below), means that <title level="m"
              >Description</title> is a highly intertextual work – and in some places, little more than an assemblage of acknowledged and
            unacknowledged quotations. For that very reason, it is all the more fascinating and significant.</p>

        <div type="section">
          <head>*</head>
          <p>Throughout <title level="m">A Description</title>, Glover attributes atheism, or ‘irreligion’, to the ‘corruption of manners’ and ‘the
            reasonings of false philosophy’, and connects it directly, as both cause and consequence, with ‘the blood-stained scenes of revolutionary
            France’. In attacking this ‘false philosophy’, Glover makes clear his conviction that atheists either mistakenly or deliberately misread
            and misrepresent the natural world, attributing to ‘chance’ those phenomena which are, in his opinion, clear evidence of design. Foremost
            amongst these phenomena are ‘the anatomy of the human frame’ and wonders of the Alpine landscape visible at Chamonix-Mont Blanc.</p>
          <p>Glover’s <title level="m">Description</title> is, in this respect, part of a tradition well-established by 1819 of seeing the Alpine
            sublime as evidence, by design, for the existence of a creator-god. This tradition is present in both eighteenth-century philosophical
            aesthetics – it finds prominent expression, for example, in <title level="m">Essays on the Nature and Principles of Taste</title> (1790),
            by the Scottish priest Archibald Alison (1757-1839) – as well as in more popular genres, such as the novels of Ann Radcliffe. It is
            perhaps most familiar to scholars of romanticism today from Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s ‘Hymn before Sun-Rise, in the Vale of Chamouni’
            (1802), with its repeated insistence that ‘God!’ is everywhere visible (and even audible!) in the landscape.<note place="foot"
              resp="editors" xml:id="ftn7" n="7"> For more detailed discussion of the tendency, in the late eighteenth century and Romantic period, to
              read the natural sublime as evidence of divine design, see, for example, Nicolson, <title level="m">Mountain Gloom and Mountain
                Glory</title>, pp. 143, 392-3 and <title level="m">passim</title>; and Duffy, <title level="m">The Landscapes of the Sublime</title>,
              pp. 46-50. As Thomas De Quincey was the first to observe, Coleridge’s ‘Hymn’ is of course freely adapted from an earlier work on the
              same topic by the Danish poet Friederike Brun (1765-1835).</note></p>
          <p>Although Samuel Glover never mentions Percy Shelley by name, Glover’s epigraph to <title level="m">Description</title> nevertheless makes
            it clear that Shelley’s critiques – in <title level="m" xml:space="preserve">Six Weeks’ Tour </title>and ‘Mont Blanc’ – of such pietist
            responses to Chamonix-Mont Blanc were foremost in his mind whilst he wrote. Glover takes as his epigraph a quotation from the attack on
            Percy Shelley by John Taylor Coleridge (1790-1876) in his review of Leigh Hunt’s (1794-1859)
            <title level="m" xml:space="preserve">Foliage </title>(1818) in the <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title> for January 1818: <quote>if

              hollow and more appalling thunder of the deep and unseen avalanche,—if we were told of a man who, thus witnessing the sublimest

                pp. 325-35 (329). Glover’s choice of epigraph was first noted, but only in passing, by William St. Clair in <title level="m">The
                  Reading Nation and the Romantic Period</title> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 292, n.79.</note></quote> The
            context here is, of course, the controversy – now well known to scholars of the romantic period – surrounding the inscriptions made by
            Percy Shelley in the guestbooks and registers of various hotels and tourist sites around Chamonix-Mont Blanc in the summer of 1816, in
            which he signed himself atheist, democrat, and philanthropist, and gave his destination as hell.</p>
          <p>One of the <ref target="https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/news/shelleys-shocking-atheist-declaration-rediscovered-after-200-years/">actual
              pages</ref> on which Shelley wrote – in the register of the Hôtel de Londres at Chamonix, where the Shelleys stayed in July 1816 – has
            recently been discovered in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge. It makes clear the kind of pietist sentiment to which Shelley was
            responding. At the top of the page survive seven lines which seem to be only the conclusion of a lengthier enthuse about the landscape and
            the divinity and which end with the affirmation that ‘Such scenes as these, these most forcibly inspire the love of God!’. Shelley was
            evidently not the only one to be provoked by this. An earlier respondent has written immediately beneath the above: ‘Why are people so
            anxious to make themselves ridiculous in the eyes of everybody? What nonsense!’. Shelley’s own response follows further down the page.</p>
          <p>Gavin De Beer was the first to make a detailed study of these inscriptions and the immediate response to them.<note place="foot"
              resp="editors" xml:id="ftn9" n="9"> Gavin De Beer, ‘An “Atheist” in the Alps’, <title level="j">Keats-Shelley Memorial Bulletin</title>
              9 (1958), pp. 1-15.</note> As De Beer notes, one of the most important contemporary responses in print to Shelley’s inscriptions was
            given by the English historian and protestant minister Thomas Raffles (1788-1863) in his <title level="m">Letters During a Tour</title>
            (London, 1818). Raffles claims to have seen for himself the inscription made by Shelley in the visitor’s cabin at Montenvers, beside the
            Mer de Glace: <quote>Yet, amid these scenes – surrounded by the sublimest demonstrations of the eternal power and Godhead of the Almighty,
              a wretch has had the hardihood to avow and record his atheism, having written over against his name in the album at Montanvert,
                “<emph>an atheist</emph>”. It seems as if some emotions of shame touched him at the time, for he has written it in Greek. It caught
              the eye of a divine who succeeded him, and he very properly wrote underneath, in the same language, “<emph>If an atheist, a fool – if
                not, a liar</emph>”.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn10" n="10"> Thomas Raffles, <title level="m">Letters During a Tour

                168n. As Raffles observes, the first clause of this response alludes to Psalms xiv 1: ‘The fool hath said in his heart there is not
                God’ (p.168n.).</note></quote> Glover was evidently familiar with Raffles’s <title level="m">Letters During a Tour</title>: Glover’s
            attacks on atheism in his preface to <title level="m" xml:space="preserve">Description </title>(see Note 3 to Preface), and his
            description of the Mer de Glace in the main text (see Notes 62 and 94 to <title level="m">Description</title>), both draw unmistakably
            from Raffles’ work, and it is actually possible that the two had met or had at least some acquaintance in common (see below). What is
            clear, then, is that Glover’s attacks on atheism in <title level="m">Description</title>, and on atheistic responses to the Alpine sublime
            in particular, were motivated in part by a desire not only to rebuff such responses but also by a desire to reply quite specifically to
            Shelley’s inscriptions, to <title level="m">Six Weeks’ Tour</title>, and to ‘Mont Blanc’. <title level="m">Description</title> is thus
            part of the reception history of the Shelleys’ responses to Chamonix-Mont Blanc and of the wider legacy of the so-called ‘<title level="m"
              >Frankenstein</title> summer’ of 1816. Of course neither John Taylor Coleridge nor Thomas Raffles actually names Shelley, but Glover
            would have been left in no doubt from the <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title>, at least, about the identity of the ‘wretch’ in
            question. And whilst it cannot be proven on the basis of the evidence now extant, it remains just possible that Glover actually had some
            more direct connection with the Shelley circle than his familiarity with these second-hand reports and his reading of <title level="m">Six
              Weeks’ Tour</title>.</p>
          <p>One tantalising possibility concerns the responses made to Percy Shelley’s inscriptions on site, at Chamonix. As Gavin de Beer first
            noted, a letter to the editor of the <title level="j">Christian Observer</title> for October 1824 discusses those inscriptions,
            specifically in order to correct an earlier number of the <title level="j">Christian Observer</title> which had attributed them not to
            Shelley but to Byron.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn11" n="11">
              <title level="j">The Christian Observer</title>, 24 (1824), p. 619.</note> The correspondent substantiates this correction by explaining
            that they had themselves been with ‘an English party’ which ‘visited the mountains and glaciers around the mighty Mont Blanc’ in July
            1816: <quote>In several of the albums or registers at the hotels, they had the pain of reading the autograph of <emph>Percy Bysshe
                Shelley</emph>, with the uniform appendix of impious sentiments expressed in studious boldness of phrase, sometimes in dogmatical
              brevity, and sometimes with declamatory affectation.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn12" n="12">
                <emph>Ibid</emph>. (original emphasis).</note></quote> The correspondent goes on to explain that it was they who had written the
            riposte, in Greek, to Shelley’s inscription in the album at Montenvers, alluding to <title level="m">Psalm</title> xiv 1: ‘The fool hath
            said in his heart there is no God’. The letter is signed ‘S’. Could this ‘S’ have been Samuel Glover? Could Samuel Glover have seen and
            responded to Percy Shelley’s inscriptions, on site, at Chamonix, and subsequently done so again in <title level="m">Description</title>?
            Or could Samuel Glover have been the author of the enthusiastic entry about the landscape ‘forcibly’ inspiring ‘the love of God’ in the
            register of the Hôtel de Londres? Samuel Glover’s claim, in <title level="m">Description</title>, that it was ‘twenty years’ since he had
            been to Chamonix would seem to invalidate either possibility out of hand, but of course that claim could be defensive, not least since
            Shelley’s inscriptions were clearly one, though certainly not the only, motive for the composition of <title level="m"

          <p>The second part of Glover’s <title level="m">Description</title> provides an account of the devastating glacial outburst flood of 16 June
            1818, when a dam of ice which had been formed across the Dranse de Bagnes river by the increase of the Giétro Glacier gave way, sending a
            substantial body of water at high speed down the Valley of Bagnes towards the town of Martigny. Forty four people were killed and
            widespread destruction caused. A detailed verbal report on this disaster was given to the Helvetic Society of Natural Science at Lausanne
            on 29 August 1818, by Hans Conrad Escher von Der Linth (1767-1823), a Swiss natural philosopher and engineer who had been involved in the
            last-minute attempts to avert the flood. This report was transcribed by Marc-Auguste Pictet (1752-1825), another Swiss natural
            philosopher, and supplied by him in English translation to <title level="j">Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</title>, which carried it in
            the number for October 1818. Thereafter, reports were widely circulated and travel guides from the 1830s and 40s still routinely referred
            to the disaster.</p>
          <p>Glover’s account of it in <title level="m">Description</title> is substantially a reprint of a 16-page pamphlet on the subject which he
            had already published in 1818: <title level="m">A Description of the Inundation of the Valley of Bagnes in Swisserland</title>. This
            earlier pamphlet opens with a two-page ‘fearful dream’ – of the destruction of the valley where the author has been a welcome guest –
            which presages the factual account of the actual disaster.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn13" n="13"> Samuel Glover, <title

            father of the American painter Edward Troye (1808-74), who exhibited in the second decade of the nineteenth century, in both Geneva and in
            London, relief models of various parts of the Alps, including Chamonix-Mont Blanc. Little information survives about Troye. Thomas Raffles
            reports that he saw relief models of the Alps at Geneva in 1817 (presumably by Troye) and had actually purchased one of them – which
            raises the aforementioned possibility that Glover and Raffles also met, either in Switzerland or in London (see <title level="m"
              >Raffles</title> 155n.). The Scottish industrialist William Archibald Caddell (1755-1855) reports in his <ref

            must have taken place later that year, and presumably after the disaster in the Val de Bagnes in June.<note place="foot" resp="editors"

          <p>The frontispiece of Glover’s <title level="m">Inundation</title>, which depicts a peasant praying upon a ridge whilst flood waters rage
            through the valley beneath him, is almost certainly the work of Troye. The exact grounds for Troye’s claim to be ‘modeller and sculptor’
            to Princess Charlotte of Wales (1796-1817), the wife of the prince regent, who died in childbirth in November 1817, are less certain. If
            any formal connection was made, then this was presumably during one of Charlotte’s European tours in 1815, 1816, or 1817. Thomas Raffles
            reports that his guide at Chamonix-Mont Blanc, whom he met at Geneva, and by whom he there was shown one of Troye’s relief models, had
            also served as guide to Princess Charlotte – so it seems likely that she had also seen, and had perhaps also purchased one of the
              models.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn16" n="16"> See Raffles, <title level="m">Letters During a Tour</title>, p.

            of Glover’s <title level="m">Inundation</title>, who had by then relocated to 6 Red Lion Court, Fleet Street. In it, Troye confirms that:
            ‘he can, from the experience he has had, offer with confidence his services to amateurs in general, for executing, in a similar manner,
            and with similar accuracy’ models of various Alpine scenes, including Mont Blanc and ‘the Valley of Bagnes, lately inundated’.<note

              exhibition in Soho Square, of models of the most interesting points in Switzerland, upon a larger scale than that on which any have
              hitherto been constructed. The one of Mont Blanc with the vale of Chamouni is remarkably well executed, with regard both to accuracy and
              to effect. The proportion between the horizontal and vertical scales has been well judged, and is admirably calculated to convey to the
              spectator just impressions of the magnificence of Swiss scenery. To have constructed a model of the whole of Switzerland upon such a
              scale would have required by far too large a space for an exhibition, and M. Troye has preferred confining it to the most interesting
              objects. The greater part of the other models in this exhibition are also upon a large scale, and are equally beautiful : the most
              striking are the road over the Simplon, the Mont Righi, with the fall of the Rossberg, and the town of Geneva. In short, the extreme
              accuracy observed with regard to the forms of the objects, the striking imitation of nature, and the powerful effect of the ensemble,
              procure for this collection of models a decided superiority over every other exhibition of the kind.<note place="foot"

            Glover’s<title level="m" xml:space="preserve"> Description</title>, make clear, Glover evidently had some close connection with Troye and

            the possibility that Troye’s <title level="m">Short Account of Mont Blanc</title> was in fact written by Glover. What seems clear,
            however, is that the two men, having had some prior acquaintance during Glover’s residence in Switzerland (see below and <title level="m"
              >Description</title>), worked together to promote each other’s work, and the Frith Street exhibitions in particular, after Troye’s
            arrival in London. Glover’s <title level="m">Description</title>, then, was motivated not only by a desire to rebuff atheistic responses
            to the Alpine sublime but also had its origins in this commercial collaboration. </p>

          <p>In the third part of <title level="m">Description</title>, Glover begins finally to provide the detailed account of Chamonix-Mont Blanc
            which the reader might reasonably have been led by the title to expect rather earlier. As will become quickly apparent from the editorial
            notes, this portion of the text is highly derivative and based largely on existing writings about the valley, most notably on the accounts
            given by Horace-Bénédict de Saussure in volumes two and four of his <title level="m">Voyages dans Les Alpes</title>. The compellingly
            ‘virtual’, first-person description of an ascent of Mont Blanc with which Glover concludes <title level="m">Description</title> is all but
            a translation from the account given by Saussure of his ascent in August 1787, in volume 4 of <title level="m">Voyages</title>. Editorial
            collation confirms that Glover took as his source the extended account given by Saussure in <title level="m">Voyages</title> rather than
            the shorter version which Saussure published as <title level="m">Relation Abrégée</title> in 1788 (and later included in <title level="m"
              >Voyages</title>). This makes Glover’s <title level="m">Description</title> in fact the earliest English language translation of that
            key section of Saussure’s <title level="m">Voyages</title>, albeit unacknowledged by the translator!</p>
          <p>The little of this third part of <title level="m">Description</title> which seems to be properly Glover’s own is almost entirely
            concerned with the rebuttal of atheism. The pre-eminent instance, here, is the wonderful, if rather sadistic, Dante-esque vision of an
            Alpine inferno, in which Glover imagines different parts of the sublime landscape being apportioned as prisons to punish those guilty of
            various transgressions. Atheists are condemned to be suspended in icicles high above the surrounding landscape, ‘doomed eternally to
            behold those magnificent works of nature they ever affected to despise’. Also striking in this vision of an Alpine hell, however, is the
            harsh criticism of members of the political establishment: of ‘sovereigns [...] forgetful of their first, great duty, the happiness of
            their subjects’, of ‘Court parasites’, and of ‘evil Counsellors, of Ministers’ who ignore public good and pursue only their own ‘interest’
            and ‘ambition’. Both the targets of this criticism and the tone in which it is offered seem markedly at odds with the ostensibly pietist
            rhetoric of Glover’s <title level="m">Description</title> and rather closer, in fact, to Radical critique of the establishment by figures
            like Leigh Hunt and Percy Shelley. And then there is the account of an accident on Mont Blanc which Glover introduces into his description
            of the ascent – it is not present in Saussure’s account, nor in any other account which I have read – which seems pointedly to contrast
            the self-indulgence of ‘an English nobleman’ with the heroism and stoicism of the local guides.</p>
          <p>The presence of such politically incongruous material in <title level="m">Description</title>, albeit in very limited quantities, poses
            some interesting questions about what exactly Glover might have been attempting to achieve in his book – beyond its commercial connection
            with Troye and its ostensible desire to criticise atheistic responses to the Alpine sublime. Such questions would of course admit rather
            more easily of answers if we could be sure of who Samuel Glover was, but on that subject, alas, considerable difficulties present
            themselves and only speculation is really possible.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
          <head>*</head>
          <p>Little definitive information concerning Samuel Glover has survived and the few concrete details which are available are either provided
            by, or in connection with, <title level="m">Description</title>. Some of these details are explicitly stated in the text, assuming it to
            be reliable. Most notable are Glover’s claims that it was ‘twenty years’ since he had been to Chamonix and that he had then had ‘a long
            residence in Swisserland’, during which he first met Jean-Baptiste Troye. The connection with Troye seems indisputable. But if we take the
            first of these claims at face value, that would place Glover in Chamonix in 1798-99, that is, around about the time of the invasion of
            Switzerland by French Republican armies (March-June 1798) and the failed Austro-Russian attempts to drive those armies back into France
            (May-October 1799). That is not impossible, of course, but somehow it seems unlikely.</p>
          <p>A ‘Glover’ did accompany the Scottish traveller Patrick Brydone (1736-1818) on his tour of Sicily and Malta in 1770, and, as Brydone
            makes clear in his preface to his <title level="m" xml:space="preserve">Tour Through Sicily and Malta </title>(1773), this Glover had
            already been in Europe with William Beckford of Somerely (d.1779).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn20" n="20"> Patrick
              Brydone, <ref target="https://books.google.dk/books?id=SgMLAAAAYAAJ"><title level="m">A Tour Through Sicily and Malta, In a Series of
                  Letters</title></ref>, 2 vols. (London, 1773), i, 2.</note> For Brydone’s Glover to be <emph>Samuel</emph> Glover, however, the
            author of <title level="m">Description</title> would have to have been in his late sixties or early seventies in 1819: again, not
            absolutely impossible, but perhaps unlikely.</p>
          <p>Another potential candidate might be the jeweler Samuel Glover (1774-1822), who operated out of Bull &amp; Mouth St. (now St.
            Martin’s-le-Grand / Angel Street) in the City of London. A <ref
              target="http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O123384/mourning-ring-glover-samuel/">mourning ring</ref> made by this Samuel Glover on the
            occasion of the assassination of the British Prime Minister Spencer Perceval (1762-1812) on 11 May 1812 survives in the Victoria and Albert
            Museum, in London. But could he really have been the author of <title level="m">Description</title>? A connection with Troye is certainly
            possible, but a long residence in Switzerland or even a trip to Chamonix-Mont Blanc seem less plausible.</p>
          <p>And then there are the clues implicit in the text concerning its author. He evidently had some, if not necessarily an extensive education
            in the Classics. He evidently also had some familiarity with the works of Shakespeare, Milton, and Thomson, whom he may quote at least in
            part from memory – perhaps because he did not have access to the texts whilst he composed <title level="m">Description</title>. He seems
            also to have been very well-versed in contemporary writing about Chamonix-Mont Blanc, to have read French fluently, and to have had access
            to a copy of Saussure’s <title level="m">Voyages dans Les Alpes</title> whilst he composed <title level="m">Description</title> – although
            of course Troye might have been of use in various ways here. And most of all, if also most subjectively, the author of <title level="m"
              >Description</title> certainly had an appreciable personal investment in Chamonix-Mont Blanc: his fondness and enthusiasm for the place
            are everywhere apparent in the text. Could these facts, taken together with the alterations to the title page of the ‘second edition’ of
              <title level="m">Description</title>, suggest that ‘Samuel Glover’ was, after all, a pseudonym of Jean-Baptiste Troye? </p>
          <p>One further, equally-speculative possibility remains to be considered: that for all its ostensibly ultra-pietist rhetoric – indeed,
            perhaps <emph>because</emph> of that rhetoric – <title level="m">A Description of the Valley of Chamouni</title> is in fact a kind of
            parody or satire, intended to ridicule, through the very extent of its hyperbole, those conservative responses to the Alpine sublime which
            it ostensibly seeks to promote. In favour of this hypothesis we have the Radical sentiments which creep in, every now and then, to <title
              level="m">Description</title>, and the apophatic engagement with ‘romance’, whereby the author both denies and affirms his commitment to
            ‘fabulous history’. There is a playfulness about this material which undercuts the ostensibly solemn tone of the text. And then there is,
            finally, the admittedly-remote possibility that ‘Samuel Glover’ had some closer acquaintance with the works of Mary and Percy Shelley than
            one might expect from an average reader in 1818-19 (see Notes 2 and 11 to Glover’s Preface, and Notes 3, 98, 114, and 116 to the Main Text
            of <title level="m">Description</title>).</p>
          <p>Pietist hymn? radical squib? coterie piece? promotional exercise? – there seems to be no way, now, for us to reach a definitive
            conclusion. What <title level="m">Description</title> undoubtedly does show us, however, is the range and the richness of romantic-period
            writing about Chamonix-Mont Blanc and the continued influence of that writing on academic and popular engagements with the area today.</p>
