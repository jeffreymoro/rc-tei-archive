            <p class="noCount">AMONG the events which mark the annals of the last century, one of the most interesting
               is <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n02.html">the discovery</a> of the lovely, the fertile, the highly romantic Valley of Chamouni. Of course, the
               following pages will be perused with indifference by those, who delight in the destruction
               of the human race; and who, instead of consigning, were it possible, to eternal oblivion
               the blood-stained scenes of revolutionary France, <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n03.html">blazon them forth as the noblest effort of human nature</a>; still less will they be honoured with a glance from those, whose object is base
               lucre, and who calculate the importance of an event by the treasure, which swells
               their insatiable avarice. But to those, <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n04.html">“who look through nature up to nature’s God;”</a> to the Atheists, who in despite of their revolting principles, discover in the minutest,
               as in the most stupendous works, the master-hand {8} of the Mighty Architect through
               whom we live, and move, and have our being; to all, whose bosoms, on beholding the
               magnificent works of creation, swell with rapture, and own the presence of the Deity,
               I would say, “<a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n05.html">attend me to the valley</a>, where the wonders of nature are lavishly spread around; where the eye is alternately
               struck with fertile fields and pyramids of ice; with murmuring streams and roaring
               torrents; with gently rising grounds and frightful precipices; and with meadows of
               the richest verdure, bordered with everlasting snow.”</p>
            <p class="noCount">Wonderful is the creation, in which the Almighty has manifested his perfections; and
               displayed his unbounded power: no language can describe, no colours shew the grandeur
               of this valley; but I will humbly attempt a feeble outline of its beauties, and trace
               the effect produced on my senses by the rapid succession of scenes, now inviting to
               repose, now chilling with horror.</p>
            <div> </div>
            <p class="noCount">TO visit <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n06.html">the renowned passage of the SIMPLON</a>, <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n07.html">the celebrated convent of SAINT BERNARD</a>, <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n08.html">the Valley of BAGNES</a>, scene of the most frightful disasters, or the romantic Vale of CHAMOUNI, it is necessary,
               on quitting the <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n09.html">PAYS DE VAUD</a>, in Switzerland, to traverse the town of <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n10.html">SAINT MAURICE</a>, whose ancient bridge of one bold arch crosses from rock to rock the rapid Rhone,
               which discharges itself into the Lake of Geneva.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Near to Saint Maurice is the beautiful cascade called the <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n11.html">PIESVACHE</a>, which precipitates itself from the height of eighty feet, and falls into the Rhone.</p>
            <p class="noCount">At the distance of eight miles is <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n12.html">the town of MARTIGNY</a>, the resort of the neighbouring villagers for the purpose of selling the produce
               of the adjacent vallies: fruit, game, butter, cheese, honey, or of bartering for commodities,
               of which they stand in need. This town consists of 2500 inhabitants, and is {9} situated
               on the Rhone, at the junction of three vallies; one of which, leading to the SIMPLON,
               discovers to the astonished eye of the traveller, <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n13.html">the herculean works of NAPOLEON BUONAPARTE</a>; who, to open a passage for his army to the delightful plains of Italy, with incredible
               labour and perseverance, perforated rocks of 750 feet in thickness; thereby enabling
               his soldiers to avoid <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n14.html">precipices, which thrilled the boldest heart with terror</a>, and march in perfect safety.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The second valley, after following for some distance the course of a river called,
               <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n15.html">the DRANSE</a>, branches off into two smaller vallies; one of which leads to <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n16.html">the memorable, but dangerous pass of Saint Bernard, through which HANNIBAL and his
                  Carthaginian Warriors penetrated to Italy</a>; and where, isolated amid eternal snows, stands the celebrated and hospitable convent
               of that name, <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n17.html">whose dogs</a>, of an uncommon size, trained to carry baskets of provisions, have oft, by instinct,
               discovered and rescued the benighted traveller, who, bewildered in the trackless snow,
               must otherwise have perished.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The other branch conducts – no longer to the lovely valley of Bagnes, smiling in gay
               luxuriance, the abode of health and peace, where, welcoming each stranger as a friend,
               the cottagers’ doors flew open, the frugal fare was served, and, adoring the bounteous
               hand of nature, all slept in peace, but – O Providence! how mysterious are thy ways!
               – to a frightful waste, a desert, where, mingled in wild confusion, are seen fragments
               of trees, masses of rock and ice, the refuse of the torrent; – the fields, the vineyards,
               meadows, villages, have <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n18.html">“vanished like the baseless fabric of a vision,”</a> and the enlivening strains of the pastoral pipe are exchanged to heart-rending lamentations
               and accents of despair.</p>
            <p class="noCount">This hapless valley, containing twelve towns and villages, is twenty miles in length,
               and bounded by towering rocks and stupendous mountains, among which the fatal <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n19.html">Montpleureur</a>and <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n20.html">Mauvoisin</a>, source of the evil which has desolated this valley. <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n21.html">The inhabitants</a>, once in number about 3600, are frugal, healthy, and industrious; mendicity is never
               seen; their hospitality is proverbial, {10} which more than compensates for the want
               of inns; honest without pride, virtuous from principle, and adhering to the heavenly
               precept of <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n22.html">“do as thou wouldst be done by”</a>; envy, hatred, and malice, are strangers to their bosoms; strife, excepting in acts
               of benevolence, is never heard, and the genuine character of these unsophisticated
               children of nature may be duly appreciated by stating – hear it, ye civilised inhabitants
               of cities, ye, who pride yourselves on the perfection you have attained by education,
               and an intercourse with society; hear it, ye votaries of justice, ye, who exist but
               by the weakness of human nature, hear it and tremble at the possibility, at least,
               that mankind may yet be wise — IN THIS VALLEY, DURING A CENTURY, A LAW-SUIT WAS UNKNOWN!!!</p>
            <p class="noCount">Lovely valley, once rich in all the necessaries, if not the luxuries of life; blest
               with a hardy race, whose truth and goodness are proverbial; whose simplicity of manners
               recall the golden age; surrounded by rocks and precipices, and almost inaccessible
               mountains, which shelter you from the vices of mankind, as from destructive warfare,
               that long has desolated afflicted Europe; vaunt no more thy happiness, sweet valley,
               nor triumph in security; with purity of conscience blest, thy offspring slept in peace,
               the sleep of innocence, but soon awoke to horror, for in thy own bosom lurked, unheard,
               unseen, the fiend of desolation, which in one frightful moment laid waste thy verdant
               pastures, thy fertile plains, thy humble villages, and changed the smile of joy, which
               always mantled on thy peasants’ cheeks, to sorrow and despair!!</p>
            <p class="noCount">The river Dranse, already mentioned, after traversing the little <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n23.html">Valley of Torembec</a>, where it takes its rise, waters that of Bagnes. At the junction of these two vallies,
               over which a bridge is thrown, ninety feet in height, the lofty mountains of Mauvoisin
               and Montpleureur suddenly contract, and descending abruptly towards the river, divide
               the Vallies of Bagnes and Torembec. On this spot originated the evil, which has desolated
               the former valley, and plunged {11} its inhabitants into irremediable woe. Here, resting
               on the abrupt declivity of Montpleureur, was formed <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n24.html">THE FATAL GLACIER of GETROZ</a>. As this immense body of ice, impelled by its own weight, imperceptibly glided down
               the mountain, its extremity over-hung the intervening rocks, whence large masses of
               ice detached themselves, and, with a thundering noise, rolled into the valley.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n25.html">It is said, that five years ago, owing to the heat, the Glacier was greatly reduced
                  but the intenseness of the winters of 1816 and 1817 increased it to an alarming degree</a>; this accumulation of weight naturally facilitated its movement; the rocks, which
               project from the mountain’s side and overhang the river, were unable to stem its progress,
               and enormous fragments of the Glacier fell in rapid succession into the valley, and
               almost choaked the current of the Dranse.</p>
            <p class="noCount">On the 15th of May, 1818, the villagers of the Valley of Bagnes, on quitting their
               peaceful homes to pursue their daily labours, perceived the bed of the river nearly
               dry: the alarm was spread; the consternation became general; they hurried to a projecting
               rock, called <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n26.html">the Oratoire</a>, which overlooks the valley and perceived, with indescribable terror, that during
               the night the whole of the Glacier of Getroz had detached itself from the mountain,
               and precipitated itself into the narrow passage of the Vallies of Bagnes and Torembec;
               blocking up the river Dranse, which already formed a lake of considerable extent.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Information of this disaster was instantly communicated to the Government at Saint
               Maurice, which deputed <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n27.html">able engineers</a> to hasten to the spot, and adopt measures to avert the impending danger.</p>
            <p class="noCount">On examining this Glacier, or mountain of ice, it was found to be 400 feet in height,
               600 feet in length, and at its base 2000 feet in thickness. The lake, which was rapidly
               increasing, and had gradually submerged the hamlets and meadows of the little Valley
               of Torembec, was already 300 feet in depth, 600 feet in breadth, and 7000 feet in
               length. {12}</p>
            <p class="noCount">The necessity of perforating a gallery, or outlet, 50 feet above the level of the
               lake, became apparent; numbers of robust and hardy villagers presented themselves
               for the arduous enterprise; some were stationed at the mouth of, and round about the
               gallery to apprize the workmen of any danger arising from the repeated blows of their
               axes and hammers, which reverberating, as they advanced, with a noise of thunder,
               detached immense masses of ice from the summit of the Glacier: others were occupied
               in removing the rubbish from the gallery, and precipitating it down its sides. Day
               and night their labours were unceasing, and with incredible danger and fatigue, they
               succeeded in excavating through solid ice as clear as chrystal, and so hard that it
               often broke the axe, an aperture four feet broad, six feet high, AND <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n28.html">600 FEET IN LENGTH</a>.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The lake continued to increase, and on the 13th of June it rose to a level with the
               gallery, and precipitated itself into the bed of the river Dranse; forming cascade
               350 feet in height; a scene as magnificent, as unprecedented.</p>
            <p class="noCount">On the 14th of June it was discovered, that fragments of ice, which detached themselves
               from the summit of the Glacier and floated on the lake, had entered the gallery and
               blocked up its passage; the villagers, however, at the hazard of their lives, and
               with a courage bordering on despair, succeeded in removing them, and the lake continued
               to flow. On the 15th of June, the river Dranse attained its usual height, and the
               villagers retired to rest, in the hope that success had crowned their labours, and
               that danger was no more.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Their hopes, alas! were vain: <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n29.html">THE FIAT HAD GONE FORTH</a>; – even then the swift-winged messenger of death hovered around, and marked them
               for his prey: – mysterious providence, how wonderful are thy ways! – could not their
               innocence, – their upright manners, integrity of soul and strict obedience to thy
               sacred will avert the dreadful mandate? – no crime was theirs; – no visitings of remorse;
               – no fears disturbed their peaceful slumbers; their hearts were pure, their consciences
               at rest, and yet, – BUT WHO SHALL DARE TO ARRAIGN OMNIPOTENCE, {13} OR SAY “WHY DOST
               THOU SO?” – ’TIS THINE, SUPREME, TO FULMINATE THY DREAD COMMANDS; ’TIS OURS TO OBEY
               IN SILENCE, AND ADORE.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Notwithstanding the apparent security, signals were established on the summits of
               the mountains to warn the inhabitants in case of danger; by such precautions they
               flattered themselves to save their lives at least, if not their little property; but
               the Hour was come; – the torrent itself was the precursor of ruin, and in one moment
               the havoc was complete; the steps taken to prevent the increase of the lake, which
               finally burst upon this devoted valley, could not avert the fatal calamity; this immense
               body of water opened itself a passage BENEATH the mountain of ice, and then began
               the work of desolation.</p>
            <p class="noCount">A forest of trees and a village, situated near the fatal Glacier, were swept away;
               – not one villager escaped: – not a vestige remains – but large masses of ice and
               rock alone mark the spot. At <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n30.html">Champsal</a> fifty-two houses have disappeared, and the soul-piercing cries of the drowning inhabitants
               were distinctly heard amid the devastating element; every town, every village has
               suffered more or less; the greater part of Bagnes, of <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n31.html">Saint Bianchi</a>, of <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n32.html">Beauverniers</a>, and of <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n33.html">Martigny</a>, is totally destroyed. In this last town, distant from the fatal Glacier twenty-four
               miles, the water rose to the height of fourteen feet, and a rock, fifty-two feet in
               circumference, was borne along by the torrent, and left in the market-place: some
               English travellers, whose curiosity induced them to visit the fatal Glacier, were
               warned of their danger by the thunder proceeding from the bursting of the waters beneath
               the mountain of ice, and they had just time to dismount from their mules and climb
               the neighbouring acclivity, when the foaming torrent rolled at their feet: in many
               places, where the projecting rocks formed obstacles to the dreadful element, broken
               trees, masses of ice, drowned cattle, and furniture of every description, intermingled
               with the afflicting spectacle of human bodies, were heaped to the height of fifty
               feet. The whole of this once fertile valley is irrecoverably lost. The {14} extent
               of the damage, and the number, who have perished, is uncertain; the destruction is
               more prodigious and terrific than can be conceived by the most ardent imagination;
               and it will give the reader some idea of the rapidity of this dreadful torrent, when
               informed, that it traversed a distance of <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n34.html">TWENTY FOUR miles, in the short space of EIGHTY MINUTES</a>.</p>
            <p class="noCount">All communication with this hapless valley, excepting over the almost impassable mountains,
               was long impracticable, and many, who escaped the horrors of the flood, perished from
               want: the wretched villagers are to this hour employed in the heart-rending task of
               removing fragments of rock and ice, and the wrecks of their once peaceful homes, in
               search of the dead bodies of their beloved relatives; but the greater part, alas!
               perished in the waters.</p>
            <p class="noCount">But time, perhaps, which heals the wounds of suffering humanity, may pour its balm
               into their lacerated bosoms. Ah no! no! <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n35.html">“hope, which comes to all, comes not to them,”</a> – the Glacier, The FATAL GLACIER REMAINS, – like Satan, when he sealed the fall of
               man, towering amid the ruin – no human power can stir this mighty mass, This BEACON
               OF DESPAIR; and should industry and perseverance restore the beauty of the valley,
               the intenseness of a single winter, or other causes, may obstruct the present passage
               of the river Dranse, and produce, <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n36.html">the same disaster</a>.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Like our first parents, (excepting in their fall,) these virtuous, hapless villagers,
               are driven from their Eden, and doomed to seek from strangers that hospitality and
               relief, THEY NEVER DENIED TO THEIR FELLOW-CREATURES. – Let us hope they will not seek
               in vain; and, under the trials to which they are doomed, may they remember, that sufferings
               here are no particular marks of divine displeasure, and that unmerited affliction,
               supported with resignation, prepares us for ETERNITY.</p>
            <p class="noCount">But let us hasten from this scene of desolation, and traversing the third valley,

               regardless of toil and danger, starts from his couch, and from the Vale of Triant
               ascends with eager steps the rugged mountain’s side; his senses pant to drink at the
               inexhaustible fountain of beauty which awaits him; he fears to arrive too late; he

               the rapid <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n45.html">ARVE</a> (in which gold is found) and the <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n46.html">TORRENT of L’ARVEIRON</a>, bursting from its icy cavern, now, foaming over a rocky bed, now, meandering as
               the zephyr succeeds the storm; – at a distance, the hamlets of the villagers, the
               abodes of hospitality and ever-cheerful innocence; – on the left, crowned with snow
               and fringed with icicles, which threaten the bold intruder with destruction, appear
               the craggy rocks of <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n47.html">L’ARGENTIERES</a> and <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n48.html">DU TOURS</a>, <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n49.html">the Druid’s point</a> and spire-like needle of Le GEANT; – to the right, THE LOFTY <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n50.html">BREVEN</a>, from whose summit the view stretches over the mountains of Savoy, and the innumerable
               towns and vineyards of the Pays de Vaud; thence, glancing around, it is suddenly arrested
               by the gigantic monarch of the ancient continent, the MONT BLANC, – its base and sides
               guarded by frightful Glaciers, – its summit mantled with eternal snow, the region
               of cold and silence.</p>
            <p class="noCount">This romantic valley, eighteen miles in length, but not more than half a mile in breadth,
               is situated at the foot of MONT BLANC; its form is an arc, of which the MONT BLANC
               occupies a considerable portion of its convex, and the lofty BREVEN of its concave.
               At the commencement of the eighteenth century it was so little known, that when the
               celebrated traveller, <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n51.html">Pocock, and an Englishman of the name of Wyndham</a>, impelled by an ardent desire to approach the MONT BLANC, which towers above the
               clouds, resolved to explore its vicinity, they expected to find the inhabitants uncivilised,
               – ferocious; and they armed themselves and their attendants from top to toe, to resist
               any moderate force which might be brought against them.</p>
            <p class="noCount">But how agreeably were they surprised on finding a people whose manners, tho’ <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n52.html">rude</a>, breathed the spirit of peace: the strangers were welcomed with hospitality; they
               were conducted to the motionless waves and yawning chasms of <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n53.html">THE SEA OF ICE</a>; – <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n54.html">THE EVER-VERDANT GARDEN, CASED IN ETERNAL SNOW</a>; – THE {17} GROTTO OF L’ARVEIRON; – <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n55.html">THE GLACIERS OF MONT-BLANC</a>: and they returned, charmed with their reception and penetrated with the wonders
               of this valley.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The account given by these Englishmen was electric. Travellers of every nation have
               since, during the summers, frequented the valley; and Chamouni, (or the <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n56.html">Prieure’</a>), formerly a miserable village, is now a considerable town, with <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n57.html">two excellent Inns</a>, and not only the conveniences, but the luxuries of life.</p>
            <p class="noCount">There are eleven villages, the principal of which is Chamouni; the inhabitants (about
               5000), are frugal and honest: their minds active and lively; and their tempers gay,
               inclining to raillery; of course, the fears of the two Englishmen are a never-failing
               source of amusement, especially to the old mountaineers, who still laugh and joke
               at their formidable, but <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n58.html">unnecessary precautions</a>.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Altho’ the concourse of strangers, and the money they leave behind them, have somewhat
               affected the ancient simplicity of these people, and even the purity of their manners,
               nobody has anything to fear from them; the most inviolable fidelity is observed, and
               travellers are merely exposed to the importunate solicitations of those, who eagerly
               offer their services <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n59.html">as guides</a>.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n60.html">principal commerce</a> is in cheese and honey; the latter, owing to the quantity of larch trees, whence
               the bees derive their sweets, is of uncommon whiteness: – little corn is grown, but
               the meadows, in the centre of which appear huge masses of snow, the remains of the
               furious AVALANCHES, which roll from the mountains and defy the summers’ heat, are
               of matchless richness and verdure.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n61.html">Chrystals</a> are here found in all their purity, and the hope of enriching themselves by the discovery
               of chrystal caverns, is so powerful a motive, that the inhabitants expose themselves
               in the search to the most alarming dangers, and often perish in the snow, or are precipitated
               down the precipices.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The indications of these grottos of chrystal are white veins of quartz, which appear
               on the surface of the rocks, chiefly in inaccessible places; the villagers arrive
               at them by hewing paths across the Glaciers, or suspending themselves by {18} ropes
               over the most frightful precipices: – when they reach the spot, they strike the rock,
               and if it return a hollow sound, they open it with a hammer, or blow it up with gunpowder.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n62.html">The chace of the chamois, or mountain-goat</a>, is equally dangerous, and carries off, in the flower of their age, many, whose lives
               are invaluable to their families. The hunter sets out at night to gain the elevated
               spots, where the chamois feed; – here, concealed behind a rock, the snow his bed,
               a stone his pillow, he resigns himself to sleep, from which the morning dew awakes
               him: at length the mountain-goats arrive, and whilst one of them stations himself
               on a spiring rock to give the alarm, the others browse and alternately relieve the
               sentinel: the slightest noise suffices to rouse them to a sense of danger, and with
               incredible velocity, they bound over chasms of snow and ice, followed by the intrepid
               hunter, who carefully marks their tracks and pursues, during several days, the chace,
               regardless of his family, who await his return with trembling anxiety.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Sometimes the chamois, after skirting on a narrow ridge a dangerous abyss, find themselves
               on the brink of a precipice, whence there is no retreating but by the road they came:
               here the hunter’s danger is most imminent; the chamois, no longer timid, boldly advance
               to meet the enemy, who fires, and by throwing himself prostrate, sometimes escapes
               destruction, as the chamois would, otherwise, force a passage between the hunter and
               the overhanging rock, and hurl him down the precipice.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n63.html">The infatuation of the inhabitants</a> for this chace, borders on romance; – a traveller, expressing his surprise to a young
               mountaineer, “my grandfather, he said, and my father perished in pursuit of the chamois,
               and whenever I leave my tender wife, my lovely infants, I regard my hunting dress
               as my shroud, convinced that the same fate awaits me.” His prophecy was accomplished;
               – on the morrow he departed – never to return – after a long search, he was found
               at the foot of a precipice, dashed to atoms. {19}</p>
            <p class="noCount">Descending from the COL-DE-BALME by an easy and open path, as if nature had ordained
               no danger should appal the stranger, the first object which presents itself is the
               celebrated</p>
            <p class="noCount"><em class="large"><a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n64.html">Cavern of Du Tours</a>,</em></p>
            <p class="noCount">extending half a league under the Glaciers of that name, and <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n65.html">abounding in petrified fishes, sea-shells, and various marine productions</a>: – virgin-gold and chrystals in all their purity are also found; the <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n66.html">stalactites or spars</a> are remarkable for size and beauty; – but the danger attending the traveller, who
               explores the interior of this cavern, is sufficient to check the most ardent curiosity,
               since enormous icicles, like the sword suspended by a hair over the head of <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n67.html">Damocles</a>, threaten, at the slightest vibration of sound, to detach themselves from their slender
               supports, and crush him beneath their weight; – the guides, therefore, insist on the
               strictest adherence to rules, necessary for self-preservation, and enjoin the profoundest
               silence.</p>
            <p class="noCount">A melancholy circumstance which lately occurred, illustrates, beyond the power of
               words, the necessity of conforming to the guides’ precautions. A traveller and his
               son explored the interior of the cavern – the usual warning, during their subterranean
               research, was rigidly observed; but, on returning to the entrance, the youth, actuated
               by curiosity to witness the effect of sound, fired a pistol; the thunder, proceeding
               from the falling of the stalactites and masses of ice in and around the cavern, resembled
               the repeated discharges of artillery, and, horrible to relate, the son was literally
               cleft in twain by the edge of a <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n68.html">ponderous icicle</a>, which shattered the arm of his agonized father.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The guides escaped by miracle; but the dreadful scene is traced in characters indelible
               on their memories, and they prefer braving the dangers attendant on the ascent to
               the summit of Mont-Blanc, rather than revisit this fatal cavern. {20}</p>
            <p class="noCount">On arriving at the foot of the COL-DE BALME, you skirt the rapid Arve, which traverses
               the valley; now, gliding thro’ a deep, but level bed, now, dashing thro’ fragments
               of rocks, foaming and boiling in its descent; then, expanding, it overflows a large
               portion of the plain, and returning to its channel, meanders in conjunction with L’ARVEIRON
               thro’ the valley.</p>
            <p class="noCount">As you advance, the wildest tracts border on the richest pastures; – eternal ice and
               snow intermingle with verdure, vying with the emerald; – larch-trees and black pines
               clothe the mountains’ sides, whence, in formidable array, and stretching far into
               the valley, as if to dispute the passage, appear</p>
            <p class="noCount"><em class="large">The Glaciers</em>,</p>
            <p class="noCount">or pyramids of ice, not smooth and slippery, but rough and porous.</p>
            <p class="noCount">That these Glaciers <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n69.html">increase and decrease</a>, is evident from the following circumstance: their borders are skirted with trees,
               some of which are eighty feet in height, and of a great age: between these and the
               Glaciers are trees of a later growth, which have been overturned by the ice; hence
               it is clear that the ice once extended to the trees of larger growth, and as it dissolves
               or retires a number of trees shoot up on the spot which it occupied, and as the Glaciers
               again advance, they in their turn are enveloped and overthrown.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The Glaciers are of two descriptions – those occupying the deep vallies, situated
               in the bosom of the Alps, many leagues in length, intersected with large crevices
               from 100 to 600 feet in depth, and distinguished by the name of Ice-vallies: others,
               emerging from the snow, which clothes the mountains’ sides, and assuming the appearance
               of pyramids or ruins.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The Glaciers of Chamouni are of the latter description. These vast masses of ice,
               resting on an inclined plane, are impelled forward by their own weight, and being
               weakly resisted by the intervening rocks, they imperceptibly advance into the plain,
               threatening in time to obstruct the course of the rapid ARVE; altho’, {21} from the
               breadth of the valley, the same disaster, which has lately desolated the once fertile
               valley of Bagnes, is, happily, not to be apprehended.</p>
            <p class="noCount">On approaching the town of Chamouni, the rocks assume the appearance of mouldering
               fortifications, or rise in <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n70.html">spiring needles</a>, which pierce the clouds; frequently huge fragments detach themselves from their
               summits, and bound from precipice to precipice, but ’ere they reach the plain, they
               are shivered into dust.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Here, the rippling stream modestly announces its approach; – there, the torrent precipitates
               itself from the mountains’ height, and its thunder is increased by the devastating</p>
            <p class="noCount"><em class="large">Avalanches</em>,</p>
            <p class="noCount">which are formed in the following manner: the snow, that lodges on the pinnacles of
               the rocks, accumulating, at length falls, and rolling down the declivity, increases
               to an enormous size, sweeping before it forests and rocks, and overwhelming villages
               in its furious career.</p>

            <p class="noCount">To guard against these disasterous events, the mountaineers encourage the growth of
               trees, particularly around the villages and on the sides of the mountains, whence
               the danger is apprehended; – they are preserved with reverential awe, and have often
               diminished, if not entirely averted the dreadful calamity – thus, what contributes
               to the beauty of the vallies, affords security to the inhabitants.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Impressed with admiration, awe, and reverence, the mind, overpowered by the wonders
               of nature, willingly escapes from the tumults occasioned by the rapid {22} succession
               of scenes so novel, and you gladly seek repose, to be enabled minutely to examine
               the details of this valley, and enter on your <span class="foreign"><a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n72.html">coup-d-essai</a></span> as Mountain traveller, by climbing, on the following day, to the summit of</p>
            <p class="noCount"><em class="large">THE BREVEN</em></p>
            <p class="noCount">This lofty mountain is <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n73.html">7086 feet</a> in height; its rugged aspect and steep ascent repels, rather than invites the traveller
               – in itself it is destitute of all attraction, but nature has abundantly compensated,
               by placing it in a situation of matchless beauty and grandeur: it rises in the centre
               of an amphitheatre, original in the universe, in which nature has lavished her wonders,
               and appears to have set bounds even to her own creative powers.</p>
            <p class="noCount">My pen trembles to proceed! – altho’, <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n74.html">after a lapse of twenty years</a>, the impression on my senses at the recollection of this romantic valley is still
               the same, yet I feel, forcibly feel the presumption of attempting to delineate, where
               the discordant scenes of pastoral beauty – eternal ice – devastating torrents – murmuring
               streams – overhanging rocks – sloping lawns and snow-clad mountains, strive for pre-eminence;
               memory is my guide, and if I fail correctly to portray, the wish to please, at least,
               will not be wanting,</p>
            <p class="noCount"><a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n75.html">“Soon as meek-ey’d morn her rosy steps advancing, strews the earth with orient pearls,”</a> you leave the town of Chamouni, and at once enter on the steep ascent, which continues,
               without the slightest variation, almost to the top of the mountain, when the eye is
               agreeably surprised by a verdant plain, covered with cattle.</p>
            <p class="noCount">From this plain rises a craggy rock, called <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n76.html">“la Cheminee”</a>, which must be scaled to reach the summit of the BREVEN.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Here, an almost boundless view presents itself: – unable for a single instant to repose,
               the eye wanders from dark and towering needles, that pierce the clouds, to the placid
               lake, which skirts the Pays-de-Vaud, whose numerous vineyards, villages and towns,
               appearing in succession, beautify the landscape; – thence, {23} it glances on the
               distant mountains of the <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n77.html">Jura</a>, which on that side bound the prospect, and descending, dwells with pleasure on the
               territory of <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n78.html">Geneva</a>, a republic famed for industry, its love of glorious liberty, and justly proud of
               its independence.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Fatigued with attempting to discriminate distant objects, the eye awhile reposes on
               the COL-DE-BALME, and then embarks on the region of everlasting snow and ice, thro’
               which in proud defiance rise the spire-like rocks of ARGENTIERES and DU TOURS, and
               the cloud-capt summit of LE GEANT.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Next, in its full extent, and clad in all its terrors, the SEA OF ICE appears; its
               waves are clearly discernible, and fancy gives them motion. This valley of ice, twenty
               miles in circumference and <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n79.html">600 feet in thickness</a>, is bounded by a circular and hollow rock, enclosing a mass of pure, unbroken snow,
               called the <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n80.html">TACUL</a>, surrounded by large conical points, like towers on an ancient fortification – to
               the right, a range of magnificent peakes, the intervals filled with masses of suspended
               ice, which, disengaging themselves from their heights, are dashed with thundering
               violence on the SEA OF ICE, and buried in its chasms.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The appearance of the SEA OF ICE is indeed tremendous; numerous and broad chasms intersect
               it in every direction, rendering the attempt to cross it apparently impracticable;
               still, courage and activity accomplish the task, and large pointed nails in the shoes
               and spiked sticks are found to be particularly serviceable.</p>
            <p class="noCount">But to what reflections may not the DRUIDS’ POINT give rise? – this towering needle
               is situated on an eminence, which overhangs THE SEA OF ICE, from the name it was once,
               perhaps, sacred to religious purposes and around its base the dark and lofty pines
               concealed <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n81.html">the Druids’ mysteries</a>. The guides relate <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n82.html">a melancholy proof</a> of the audacity, or rather madness of two travellers, who defied each other to scale
               its point; one of them succeeded, but in the act of exultation over his comrade, who
               had almost attained the summit {24} he became giddy; – he fell; – and his neck coming
               in contact with a projecting rock, his head was severed from his body and flew to
               an incredible distance from the spot.</p>
            <p class="noCount">To the right of THE SEA OF ICE, and stretching down the sides of the MONT BLANC into
               the valley of Chamouni, appear the Glaciers of <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n83.html">les Pelerins</a>, – of <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n84.html">du Bossons</a>, – of <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n85.html">Tacona</a>, of <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n86.html">l’Agria</a>, – of <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n87.html">des Ouches</a>, and of <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n88.html">Bionassy</a> – the eye follows them alternately, then, gradually rising, continues its course,
               and, at length, loses itself in the clouds.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Yes! – there, towering in sullen majesty, fronting THE BREVEN, – in all its grandeur,
               in all its horrors, mantled with eternal snow and ice, the region of cold and silence,
               stands the <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n89.html">almost inaccessible</a> MONT BLANC, – the gigantic monarch of the vale; – such is its magnitude, that at
               its presence the circumjacent mountains seem to shrink before him, and <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n90.html">“hide their diminished heads;”</a> the path leading to its summit is carefully pointed out by the guides, but the mind
               is too much enrapt in meditation on this colossal mountain, this mighty mass, to spare
               the least attention; – this alone amply repays your toil and danger, and insensible,
               indeed, must that heart be, which overflows not with adoration before the wondrous
               works of THE CREATOR.</p>
            <p class="noCount">But the silence, the effect of awe, that pervades the breast of those, whose eyes
               are rivetted on this stupendous mountain, is suddenly broken by the lowing of the
               herds, which graze the little plain beneath your feet and haste to crowd together:
               a rumbling noise, re-echoed by the rocks, leave it doubtful whether it be caused by
               THE AVALANCHE, rebounding from rock to rock, or by the distant thunder; – the sound
               approaches and a mist, like flakes of cotton, with white and rolling clouds, announce
               the thunder-storm; – soon the valley disappears, and at your feet, whilst all above
               is sunshine, the tempest spends its fury.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The forked lightnings are perceptible by bright and vivid flashes, which flit along,
               succeeded by a pealing crash and rapid motion on the surface of the {25} thunder-cloud,
               a portion of which, as from the cannon’s mouth, darts upwards and dissolves in air:
               the discharge of the electric fluid is followed by an universal commotion of the surrounding
               clouds, which, rolling over each other, assume the most fantastic forms: these thunder-storms
               are usually preceded by an awful stillness and closeness of the atmosphere; soon,
               however, the shrubs are stripped of their boughs and foliage; – the rocks and trees
               shivered by the electric flash and huge fragments driven to an amazing distance, and
               with dreadful velocity thro’ the air, whilst tremendous peals of thunder, reverberated
               by the mountains, render the scene awfully sublime.</p>

               which occupy the lower vallies of the Alps; the thunder, proceeding from the bursting
               of these Glaciers, and attributable to the heat of the Meridian sun, are the ravings
               of these spirits; and as it is a well-known fact that the Glaciers rise and fall,
               advance, and then recede, it is occasioned by an universal struggle of these impious
               spirits to escape from their cold and dreary prisons: but their efforts serve to increase
               their torments, by condensing more closely the ice-mountains, which envelop them.</p>
            <p class="noCount">In those masses of snow, the remains of the Avalanches, which encumber the verdant
               meadows, and defy the summers’ heat, are incarcerated <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n116.html">those scourges of the human race</a> –those depopulators of nations, who, like the thundering Avalanches, resistless in
               their course, swept all before them in their fury, marking their progress with destruction.
               Where is now the pride and pomp of war – the plumed helmet – the blood-stained sword
               – the crimsoned spear – the gaudy banner, reeking with human gore? – No more the marshalled
               legions, the licenced murderers swarm around them and obey their nod: – beneath their
               snowy prisons’ shade, screened from the mid-day sun, the shepherds and their flocks
               repose in safety; and instead of glowing at the war-denouncing trumpets’ sound, the
               infuriate spirits of these mighty conquerors are roused to frenzy by the music of
               the pastoral pipes, breathing the airs of happiness and peace.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Yon towering glaciers, which proudly advance into the vallies, aping a stately march,
               entomb <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n117.html">the spirits of those sovereigns</a>, who, forgetful of their first, great duty, the happiness of their subjects, abandon
               themselves to every vice disgraceful to humanity: the smaller glaciers, which precede
               and follow them, {30} contain the spirits of <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n118.html">Court parasites</a>, – of evil Counsellors, of Ministers, who, blind to their country’s good, and deaf
               to the peoples’ cries, were solely intent on the means of furthering their interest
               and advancing their ambition; – but their punishment is in the highest degree humiliating;
               the smaller glaciers, impregnated with a portion of these groveling spirits, instead
               of solid ice, are soft and porous; – in spring, to preserve the corn from sudden frosts,
               the Mountaineers strew their fields with the substance of these Glaciers; this disgraceful
               proceeding takes place in the vicinity of the towering Glaciers, the receptacles of
               the spirits of kings, and makes them tremble for their fate.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Within those icicles which adorn the spiring rocks, or fringe the precipices’ edge,
               are shrouded the worst of spirits; – of mortals, who prostituted their brilliant talents
               to the nefarious purpose of subverting religion and disproving the existence of a
               GOD. To the <em>Atheists</em> I assign those icicles, clear as chrystal, where, suspended high in air, these presumptuous
               spirits are unceasingly exposed to the storms and tempests which sweep around their
               icy prisons, and doomed eternally to behold those magnificent works of nature they

               burst from the agonised bosom of Satan when first he saw the sun, they curse the glorious

               CHAMOUNI about six miles, but nine miles by the path which leads thereto – it is enveloped
               in a mantle of eternal snow, which clothes its summit and sides, almost without the
               intervention of rocks to break the glare of the white appearance, whence its name

               was constructed near this peake, whence various excursions were made, and at length,

               only be crossed by a narrow ridge of ice, blasted their hopes, and they returned to
               Chamouni, convinced that nature had decreed the foot of man should never tread the

               near the PEAKE DU GOUTE, he was induced to look for chrystals, which are here found
               in all their purity; – success made him forgetful that evening approached, but he
               was aroused from his pursuit by a violent snow-storm, which enveloped him; – he called
               aloud, and endeavoured, but in vain, to trace the footsteps of his companions; – the
               darkness increased, and not daring to advance, he was necessitated to pass the night
               on the mountain, and as sleep on these heights was presumed to be mortal, he was supposed
               to have perished.</p>
            <p class="noCount">On the following day, instead of returning to the valley, this hardy mountaineer undauntedly
               ventured to explore <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n131.html">these unknown and solitary regions</a>; – his courage was rewarded by the discovery of a path which led to the summit of
               the mountain, and he returned to CHAMOUNI, his lips swelled with cold; almost blinded
               by the dazzling whiteness of the snow, and his face excoriated by the finer particles
               of ice, which the wind incessantly drove against him.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Thus, the way was marked out for future adventurers, and in particular for <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n132.html">De Saussure</a>, who has enriched natural history with numerous and valuable discoveries, and who,
               after the most indefatigable exertions, during twenty seven years, to scale this mountain,
               at length attained the object of his wishes.</p>
            <p class="noCount">But the most daring attempt to overtop this gigantic monarch of the vale, was made
               from THE WHITE VALLEY; – history has carefully registered the name of JAMES BALMAT,
               who first trod the summit of this mountain, whilst the names of those who, with a
               courage supernatural, scaled the dreadful precipice, which defies the eagles’ flight,
               are buried in oblivion. It is ever thus; – had not victory crowned <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n133.html">the Macedonian drunkard’s ravages</a>, he would have been justly branded with the names of “madman”; “robber”; instead

            </div>
            <p class="noCount">These Mountaineers, however, succeeded in their noble daring: with perseverance and
               courage for their guide, they scaled the frightful precipice; they reached its utmost
               height, and standing on the brink, measured with a steady eye its vast abyss – they
               shouted “Victory,” and eager to attain their wishes, continued their course, vying
               with each other for the glory of first reaching the mountain’s summit; but what a
               scene awaited them – in an instant they shrunk aghast, transfixed with horror; chasms
               of ice, which, however broad, no eye could fathom, crossed their path, and unwilling
               to retrace their steps, providence conducted them by LE GEANT, the SEA OF ICE, and
               the <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n134.html">MONTANVERT</a>, in safety to the VALLEY of CHAMOUNI. {34}</p>
            <p class="noCount">To scale this gigantic mountain, to which <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n135.html">“many are called, but few are chosen,”</a> it is necessary to procure guides, who are perfect masters of their business: armed
               with hatchets, cords, and long poles, pointed with iron at one end, and on the other
               a hook, they carry the provisions and a tent, as the third day of peril and fatigue
               will scarcely bring the travellers to the summit.</p>
            <p class="noCount">But for the danger of being enveloped in the dense clouds, which unexpectedly roll
               around the mountain’s sides, and during their progress compel the daring adventurers
               to remain immoveable, few provisions would be necessary, since the <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n136.html">rarification of the atmosphere</a>, after the first day’s march, greatly diminishes the appetite, but produces an ardent
               thirst, accompanied by a pulsation, which, on the mountain’s top, beats with double
               rapidity.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The guides never lose sight of the traveller; in dangerous passes they support him
               with their poles extended on each side, or even bear him in their arms; but on approaching
               certain chasms of immeasurable depth, over which a narrow ridge of ice is the only
               passage, they oblige him to regard for some time <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n137.html">the vast abyss</a>, during which they watch his countenance, and easily discern, whether he may venture
               to place his foot on the small hollow, hewn in the centre of these ridges, and vault
               across. The slightest irresolution visible in the traveller, has often determined
               the guides, notwithstanding the most lucrative offers, to return to Chamouni.</p>
            <p class="noCount">But the guides’ experience only extends to <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n138.html">the line of march</a>, since the dreadful hurricanes, accompanied with snow-storms, which delight to lord
               it over the upper regions of this colossal mountain, not only sweep away all trace
               of former footsteps, but change the aspect of the place.</p>
            <p class="noCount">On quitting the town of CHAMOUNI, the road conducts to the little village of DES BOSSONS,
               whence a narrow path leads to the Glaciers of that name. By a gentle ascent, you arrive

               of the rock, leave the vegetable covering still suspended over the chasms, and render
               the greatest precaution necessary.</p>
            <p class="noCount">On following the course of the torrent of TACONA, you arrive at an abrupt and wild
               ascent, facing the Glaciers of that name, bristling with towering pyramids of ice,
               not transparent or azure, but of a sombre hue, and intersected by dark rocks, which
               render <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n141.html">the coup d’Oeil</a> savage in the extreme.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Thus far the road is practicable for mules; after which the journey must be performed

            <p class="noCount">The hour of trial now arrives, when the stoutest heart palpitates on beholding the
               dangers which await him; Glaciers, or rocks of ice, intersected with irregular and
               yawning gulfs, on whose borders, as through a labyrinth, the traveller must wind his
               dangerous way; now, balancing on a narrow ridge of ice, bordered by fearful crevices;
               now, sliding into Chasms, whence there is no retreating, but by rugged steps, hewn
               in the solid ice with the hatchets of {37} these hardy, these indefatigable mountaineers;
               still they laugh and joke; they cheer each other, and even court the danger; but,
               on approaching certain chasms, over which are suspended <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n152.html">slight and half-congealed layers of snow</a>, a death-like silence reigns; the cords are disentwined, and linked together at the
               distance of several feet, the eye immoveably fixed on the footsteps of their preceding
               companions, they alternately tread this feeble barrier betwixt life and death.</p>
            <p class="noCount">What will not mortals do to attain the object of their wishes!!!</p>
            <p class="noCount">In this perilous situation, <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n153.html">a guide, named COUTET</a>, suddenly disappeared, and for awhile remained suspended on the brink of eternity;
               he was rescued, with difficulty, by his companions, who were scarcely able to resist
               the shock, which nearly dragged them into the abyss.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n154.html">Another guide</a>, despising the necessary precautions, was precipitated into a yawning gulf; his escape
               was miraculous; a body of snow had rolled from the neighbouring heights, and providentially
               resisting the concussion, remained wedged, half-way down the chasm: on this the guide
               had fallen; he was seen, to appearance lifeless, by his companions, who tremblingly
               approached the brink; his friend – oh that my feeble voice could trumpet forth his
               name to after ages – despising danger, seized the cords, and with determined resolution,
               ordered himself to be lowered to the friend of his youth; he found him senseless,
               but not lifeless; disengaging himself from the cords, he secured them round his friend,
               and, his heart throbbing with delight, saw him dragged in safety from the abyss.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n155.html">I deal not in romance</a>, else would I represent this noble spirit, whilst in the act of adoration for the
               success of his daring, gradually sinking with the fragile barrier, on which he stood,
               and, at length, disappearing from the horror stricken view of his companions; — —
               and were it really so, posterity would strew no flowers over, nor plant the cyprus
               around the modest urn, raised to {38} commemorate his friendship, whilst the achievements
               of the blood-besprinkled hero are engraven on adamant, and the sculptured marble proudly
               blazons forth his praise : — — — but a sweet reward awaited him; the cords were lowered,
               and in security, he joined his loved companion.</p>
            <p class="noCount">On arriving at the termination of this frightful Glacier, joy brightens every countenance,
               and hilarity is the order of the day; the provisions are spread, and whilst some are
               occupied in preparing the chafing dish to procure water by melting the snow: others,
               in case the weather is serene, satisfy their burning thirst by throwing snow-balls
               against the rocks, which, thawed by the sun, descend in small channels, and afford
               a moderate supply.</p>
            <p class="noCount">At length, you reach the chain of rocks that border the perpetual snows of MONT BLANC,
               and mount in a serpentine direction to the first of the three plains of snow, which
               conduct to the highest pinnacle of the mountain; the surface has numerous fissures,
               penetrating to a vast depth, and disclosing in their broken sides the successive layers
               of snow which are annually forming.</p>
            <p class="noCount">With great fatigue you arrive at the second plain of snow, which is very shelving,
               and where you are in danger, especially during a high wind, from the devastating Avalanches,
               which, bounding from rock to rock, sweep all before them in their fury, and spread
               themselves over the valley.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Here, the following <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n156.html">melancholy circumstance</a> took place: – an English nobleman, who, with several of his countrymen and guides,
               attempted to scale the mountain, having advanced far beyond the rest, indulged himself
               in hurling snow balls: which, accumulating with rapidity, overwhelmed three guides,
               the fathers of families, for whom this nobleman, (the least he could do), most liberally
               provided.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The snow is here of the most dazzling whiteness, forming a singular contrast with
               the sky, which, from the rarification of the air, appears almost black; – no living
               creature, no trace of vegetation is seen; and the eye, fatigued with {39} the white
               glare, reposes with pleasure on points of rocks, that appear like small islands amid
               a world of snow.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The boundary of this plain terminates THE SECOND DAY’S FATIGUE.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Immediately the guides are busied in excavating under the snow an aperture for the
               tent, to protect themselves, during the night, from the piercing wind and cold, which
               is almost insupportable; – there, huddled together in this region of eternal silence,
               uncertain, whether chance has not directed them to a spot, beneath which yawns an
               abyss, which may engulf them, or the deep and unseen AVALANCHE o’erwhelm them in its
               fury, they ruminate their danger, and anxiously await the morning’s dawn.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n157.html">The heat, at length, becomes oppressive, and obliges for an instant to quit the tent</a>; – then, what an awful scene awaits them! – what room for meditation! – how tranquil
               all around, save where, resistless in its course, the thundering AVALANCHE, with lightnings’
               speed, sweeps on the vale, or dashing from the precipices’ height, remounts in showers
               of silver; – the plain is long since wrapt in darkness, still in the west the sun’s
               last rays are seen flaming with red and gold; – in the midst of a sky, as black as
               ebony, embossed with stars more brilliant than the ruby, emerald or sapphire, and
               distant worlds <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n158.html">outlustering</a> far the diamond’s vivid blaze, the moon, refulgent orb of night, rising in cloudless
               majesty, appears in all her splendour, and illumes the deep serene; – her circle,
               in transparency and beauty, <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n159.html">vying with the bow of Iris</a>: a misty sea, chequered with glittering flakes of snow and vapours of a silvery hue,
               thro’ which the mountaintops appear like islands, rests on the valley, and partially
               conceals the midnight landscape – the clouds, which roll around the mountain’s sides,
               agitated by the wind, assume the most fantastic forms; – now, impelled by a nether
               current of air, darting upwards; – then, meeting in apparent conflict; – now, rising
               into columns and mouldering ruins, or darting forwards with rapidity, whilst others
               are immoveable; – then, driven by the wind, they blend and rapidly {40} disappear,
               when the black pines, whose perpendicular stems rise thick and high amid the dark
               shades, assume a yellow verdure, and the spiring rocks and mountains appearing in
               succession, flame with the moon’s silver light, which, fading in the distance, imperceptibly
               loses itself in darkness.</p>
            <p class="noCount">O Nature! how beauteous are thy works! – at sight of thee my bosom heaves; thoughts
               crowd too rapidly for utterance, and tears are my relief; I prostrate myself in the
               dust, and silently adore THE GREAT SUPREME, parent of light and life; – regardless
               of thy charms, O Nature! the soul, enslaved by furious passions, feels not the bliss
               which thou affordst; – happy is he, whose mind is undisturbed by fell remorse; – the
               morning wakes to joy; – the day is sacred to deeds of virtue, and the shades of night,
               shrouding him in peaceful slumbers, present celestial images to his imagination.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Such are the dreams of the Virtuous; and thou, presumptuous mortal, who boastest a
               superior understanding, but over whom the unlettered savage justly claims pre-eminence;
               – thou, – atheist! wouldst thou by artful sophistry and <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n160.html">a tale well told, where flowers conceal the wily serpent</a>, deprive him of his dearest consolation, THAT, which RELIGION GIVES – unhappy man,
               be near when death, relentless tyrant, marks THE CHRISTIAN for his prey; – no visitings
               of remorse, no fears disturb him, and his last sigh breathes hope of IMMORTALITY:
               – but when <em>the Atheist</em> dies, what fears convulse his bosom! – <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n162.html">“horror and doubt distract his troubled thoughts, and stir the hell within him; conscience
                  wakes despair, that slumbered; wakes the bitter memory, the dread of what assuredly
                  must be”</a>; his tongue, which dared prophane RELIGION, denies in death the actions of his life,
               murmuring a prayer for mercy to <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n163.html">“the Divinity, which speaks within him; which points out an HEREAFTER, and intimates
                  ETERNITY to Man.”</a></p>
            <p class="noCount"><a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n164.html">The first beams</a> of the sun arouse the travellers to resume their toil, and enter on the third and
               last plain of snow, the ascent to which is so steep, that the guides are obliged to
               hew out footsteps with their hatchets, and the air so rarefied, that after taking
               a few steps, you are necessitated to rest. {41}</p>
            <p class="noCount">In <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n165.html">two hours more</a> you reach THE SUMMIT OF MONT BLANC, when the whole appears a dream, and, for awhile,
               it is <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n166.html">impossible to analyse your ideas sufficiently</a> to enjoy the unbounded prospect.</p>
            <p class="noCount">With difficulty you distinguish the majestic peakes of L’AIGUILLES, MIDI, ARGENTIERES,
               and LE GEANT, – no longer frowning, as if proud of their towering heights, but sunk
               to an almost level, and scarcely discernible from their humble neighbours; –even the
               lofty BREVEN, appears but a trifling variation from the plain, that uninterruptedly
               extends to the lake of Geneva, beyond which, as over a rivulet, the view stretches
               across Swisserland, and loses itself insensibly in the distant provinces of France
               and Italy.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Wherever the eye is directed, a vast plain presents itself; but, as from the intenseness
               of the cold it is <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n167.html">impossible to remain</a> here long, the guides are unable to point out, with accuracy, details of this boundless
               prospect.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The summit of the mountain, which is visible at the distance of sixty eight leagues,
               or 204 miles, is <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n168.html">so narrow, as scarcely to permit two persons to walk abreast</a>; – especially on <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n169.html">the West side</a>, which is very steep, and terminates in the frightful precipices that bound THE WHITE
               VALLEY.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n170.html">To the rarefaction of the air</a> is to be attributed the burning thirst; – fire can scarcely be maintained in <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n171.html">the chafing dish</a>, and instead of a few minutes, <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n172.html">half an hour is requisite to boil water</a>; – hence the difficulty of breathing and consequent rapidity of pulsation; – from
               the same cause, the sky appears almost black; – through <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n173.html">a tube</a>, the stars are always visible; and, as on this isolated spot, there are no echoes
               to repel the sound, the report of a pistol is only equal to <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n174.html">a Chinese cracker</a>.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The appetite is lost; – wine and spirits are loathed, nothing but water is coveted;
               and <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n175.html">so piercing is the cold, that the provisions are entirely frozen, and the ink congealed
                  in the inkhorns</a>.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Experience has proved the advantage of wearing green veils in the ascent, without
               which the dazzling whiteness of the snow would be insupportable, and the face excoriated
               by the finer particles of ice, which are incessantly floating in the atmosphere.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The descent, owing to its steepness, would, but for the guides’ assistance, be extremely
               dangerous. The night is usually passed on the upper side of the frightful Glacier,
               already mentioned; and on the following day, you return to the Valley of CHAMOUNI.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Sweet valley, adieu!!! may thy peasants resist the baneful effects of luxury, which
               the influx of strangers pours into thy bosom – and may their hearts remain pure, unsullied,
