            Islam</title> (London, 1818) – and indeed this was a primary purpose of the poem itself – Percy Shelley again seeks to explain ‘the
          excesses consequent upon the French Revolution’ and to emphasise the lasting benefits achieved: <quote>The French Revolution may be
            considered as one of those manifestations of a general state of feeling among civilized mankind produced by a defect of correspondence

          pass linking Brig (in the Swiss Valais) with Domodossola (in Piedmont, Italy), and well-known amongst scholars of Romantic literature from
          Wordsworth’s account of crossing it in 1790, as told in Book IV of <title level="m">The Prelude</title> (1805, 1850). In 1801, Napoleon
          Bonaparte (1769-1821) ordered the construction of a hard road across the pass in order to facilitate the movement of materiel over the Alps.
          The work was supervised by the engineer Nicolas Céard and completed in 1805. For a contemporary estimation, cp. <title level="m"
            >Coxe</title>:</p>
        <p rend="noCount">It is quite impossible for language to convey any adequate idea of the wonders of the SIMPLON. To be described it must be
          seen. It combines throughout the awful and the sublime with the picturesque and the beautiful. There is not, perhaps, any place in the world
          where the astonished traveller will perceive, in such rapid succession, the wildest and rudest scenery intermingled with smiling vallies and
          cultivated fields. This wonderful monument of human labour and ingenuity, which may justly claim the admiration of the world extending from
          Geneva to Milan, was constructed by order of BONAPARTE, under the direction of M. CEARD, on whom it confers immortal honour (pp. 56-7).

          <emph>The inhabitants</emph>: Arguments for the moral, civic and physical virtue of high Alpine communities are relatively common in the

          his celebrated novel <title level="m">Julie, ou la Nouvelle Héloïse: Lettres De Deux Amans, Habitans d’une Petite Ville au pied des
            Alpes</title> (1761). Saussure offers an extended consideration the ‘morals of the inhabitants of Chamonix’ [‘Moeurs des Habitans de
          Chamouni’] in <title level="m">Voyages Dan Les Alpes</title> (2: pp. 121-3), which emphasises their honesty, industry, and hospitality. In
            <title level="m">Relation</title>, Marc Bourrit, noting that the inhabitants of Chamonix are ‘worthy, civic people’, asserts that
          ‘law-suits are unknown’ in the valley (pp. 58-9). In <title level="m">SWT</title>, however, the Shelleys sound a dissenting note, recording,
          at Chamonix, ‘the degradation of the human species—who in these regions are half deformed or idiotic, and most of whom are deprived of any
          thing that can excite interest or admiration’ (pp. 162-3). The ‘proprietor’ of ‘the cabinet of <title level="m">Historie Naturelle</title>’
          at Chamonix they described as: ‘the very vilest specimen of that vile species of quack that, together with the whole army of aubergistes and
          guides, and indeed the entire mass of the population, subsist on the weakness and credulity of travellers as leaches subsist on the sick’
          (pp. 170-1). See also <title level="m">Troye</title>: <quote>The inhabitants of the Alps are seldom very tall or of a handsome stature,
            strength, rather than beauty, is their characteristic; neither do they live to a very advanced age; the fatigues of their younger days

            entirely on the women: they mow the grass, fell the wood, and thrash the corn. From this laborious life the women of Chamouni are so

          <emph>Cavern…Tours</emph>: This reference offers something of a puzzle and SG seems to conflate several different sites and incidents.
          Contemporary guidebooks make no mention of a cavern ‘extending half a league’ (almost 2.5 km) under the Glacier du Tours and SG’s
          description seems to conflate both glacial and speleological features. In fact, the ‘celebrated’ location to which SG refers is almost
          certainly the Grotte de Balme (<ref target="/editions/chamouni/places/chamouni_GrottedeBalme">46º 02’ 32”N, 6º 37’ 02” E</ref>) near
          Magland, first described at length by Bourrit in <title level="m" xml:space="preserve">Relation </title>(pp. 25-31), and then by Saussure in
            <title level="m">Voyages</title> (1: pp. 320-5), and thereafter by most of the major guidebooks, including <title level="m">Coxe</title>,
          which quotes Bourrit’s account in full (pp. 44-8), and <title level="m">Ebel</title>, which notes that ‘the access to it is rather
          difficult, but may be accomplished with the assistance of guides’ (p. 382). <title level="m">Relation</title> provides considerable detail
          about the mineral formations in the cavern, but does not mention any marine fossils; <title level="m">Voyages</title>, however, discusses
          them at length (1: pp. 321-2), which suggests that it was SG’s source. However, I have found no mention of the ‘melancholy circumstance’
          which SG describes as occurring at the Grotte de Balme. Bourrit, indeed, reports that his party ‘ventured to throw’ a ‘lighted grenade’ in
          order to appreciate the echoes caused (<title level="m">Relation</title>, p. 29). But cp. <title level="m">Raffles</title> on an accident at
          the source of the Arveyron (see Note 44) on 8 August 1797: <quote>a Mons. Maritz, of Geneva […] with his son and nephew, walked some little
            distance under the arch — for the river does not occupy the whole space beneath — and there, for mere amusement, he fired his pistol. But
            he paid dearly for his rashness; for, not instantly retreating, an enormous mass of ice fell upon them all, and buried them beneath its
            weight. He himself escaped with a broken leg, his nephew was dreadfully mangled, but his son was killed (p. 172).</quote>This accident was
          sufficiently well-known to still be described by <title level="m">Murray</title> (p. 297). Hence SG is almost certainly conflating, in this
          passage of <title level="m">Description</title>, accounts of the Grotte de Balme and of the source of the Arveyron, which he describes
          separately. Today the Grotte de Balme (which is not to be confused with the now better-known Grottes de la Balme) is only accessible with a
          guide. See <ref target="http://www.savoie-mont-blanc.com/offre/fiche/grottes-de-balme/81523"

          <emph>abounding…productions</emph>: The discovery of marine fossils (often of creatures no longer apparently extant) at high altitudes
          played an important role in the various late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century debates in natural philosophy from which the science
          of geology would emerge. Notable amongst these was the debate between the so-called ‘Plutonists’ and ‘Neptunists’ about the dynamics of
          geomorphic change, that is, between those who argued that volcanic activity was the primary agent of such change and those who argued that
          water (whether in the form of a Biblical Deluge or otherwise) was responsible. That so ostensibly pietist a text as <title level="m"
            >Description</title> offers no comment on these fossils is interesting, though SG’s emphasis on their abundance might be taken as comment
          of a sort. For more detailed discussion of the contours of these debates ‘around the time that Saussure climbed Mont Blanc’, see Martin

          <emph>increase and decrease</emph>: The behaviour of the glaciers at Chamonix had been a subject of debate since Windham and Pococke’s

            us, that, in the time of their Fathers, the <foreign>Glaciere</foreign> was but small, and that there was a Passage thro’ these Valleys,
            by which they could go into the <foreign>Val d’Aoste</foreign> [on the Italian side of the Mont Blanc massif] in six Hours: But that the
              <foreign>Glaciere</foreign> was so much increased, that the Passage was then quite stopped up, and that it went on increasing every year
            (p. 13).</quote> Saussure, noting the general opinion of the locals that the glaciers were then increasing and would continue to do so,
          confirms that belief to be more accurate in terms of length than of height and thickness, and that, on the whole, the available evidence
          supported the idea of periods of increase and decrease (<title level="m">Voyages</title> 1: pp. 385-6). In <title level="m">SWT</title>, the
          Shelleys, noting the conflict between the opinion of Saussure and the locals on this point, deem the latter ‘more probable’ and conclude
          that the glaciers of the Mont Blanc massif ‘must augment and will subsist, at least until they have overflowed this vale [of Chamonix]’ (pp.
          161-2). In ‘Mont Blanc’, however, Shelley emphasises the beneficial rather than the calamitous effects of glaciation, which ultimately
          provides, via mineral-rich rivers, ‘the breath and blood of distant lands’ (l. 124).</p>

            <emph>In…Switzerland</emph>: SG’s reflection on ‘the clerical character’ and its influence on social mores in this and the following two
            paragraphs seems to reflect the unflattering remarks about ‘the state of religion’ in Geneva and Paris made in Letters XV and XIV of
              <title level="m">Raffles</title> (p. 133), and the minor public controversy to which those remarks gave rise (and hence when SG refers
            to ‘this country’, he means France, and not England). ‘Few of the doctrines, and little of the spirit, which once rendered it the glory of
            the Protestant world’, Raffles says of Geneva, ‘now remain’, and he also notes, in the Alps, what he describes as ‘monuments of
            superstition’, including the selling of indulgences (<title level="m">Raffles</title>, pp. 133, 193-4n.). ‘When I contemplate the present
            state of France’, Raffles laments:<quote>I see one part of the population the victims of the grossest superstition, and under the deadly
              influence of a mercenary and an artful priesthood […] I behold another part, bowing at the shrine of infidelity, and devoted only to the
              gratification of their sensual appetites and basest passions […] I see the few who profess a purer system, and who ought to shew a
              better way, sunk in the arms of a spiritual apathy, as dead to the things of God – as unconcerned about the Redeemer’s kingdom – as
              indifferent to their own eternal interests – as gay, as volatile, as much the lovers of pleasure, as the rest (pp. 96-7).</quote>Geneva,
            of course, had been part of the Swiss Confederation since 1814. The fact that both Raffles and SG still connect it with France is
            explained by their desire to see the atheistic principles of the French Revolution as the primary cause of the decline of public religion.
            Raffles singles out Voltaire (1694-1778), whose house in Paris he refused to visit on point of principle, as ‘the bitterest and most
            malignant enemy of the Redeemer, that ever, perhaps, appeared in a human form!’ (p. 139). As the Advertisement to the third edition of
              <title level="m">Raffles</title> observes, Helen Maria Williams (1759-1827) attacked publically, in her <title level="m">Letters on
              Events which have passed in France since the Restoration in 1815</title> (London, 1819), what she saw as Raffles’ unfair criticism of
            French Protestants – an attack rebutted in the appraisal of Williams’ <title level="m">Letters</title> given by the <title level="j"

          included William Derham (1657-1735) and William Paley (1743-1805), whose
          <title level="m" xml:space="preserve">Natural Theology; or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of The Deity, Collected from the Appearances of Nature </title>(1802)
