        <p rend="noCount"> AMONG the events which mark the annals of the last century, one of the most interesting is <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n02.html">the
            discovery</ref> of the lovely, the fertile,
          the highly romantic Valley of Chamouni. Of course, the following pages will be perused with indifference by those, who delight in the
          destruction of the human race; and who, instead of consigning, were it possible, to eternal oblivion the blood-stained scenes of
          revolutionary France, <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n03.html">blazon them forth as the noblest effort of human nature</ref>; still
          less will they be honoured with a glance from those, whose object is base lucre, and who calculate the importance of an event by the
          treasure, which swells their insatiable avarice. But to those, <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n04.html">“who look through nature up to nature’s
            God;”</ref> to the Atheists, who in despite
          of their revolting principles, discover in the minutest, as in the most stupendous works, the master-hand {8} of the Mighty Architect
          through whom we live, and move, and have our being; to all, whose bosoms, on beholding the magnificent works of creation, swell with
          rapture, and own the presence of the Deity, I would say, “<ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n05.html">attend me to the valley</ref>, where the wonders of nature are lavishly spread around; where the eye is alternately struck with fertile fields and
          pyramids of ice; with murmuring streams and roaring torrents; with gently rising grounds and frightful precipices; and with meadows of the
          richest verdure, bordered with everlasting snow.”</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> Wonderful is the creation, in which the Almighty has manifested his perfections; and displayed his unbounded power: no language can
          describe, no colours shew the grandeur of this valley; but I will humbly attempt a feeble outline of its beauties, and trace the effect
          produced on my senses by the rapid succession of scenes, now inviting to repose, now chilling with horror.</p>
        <ab facs="/sites/default/files/editions/chamouni/images/single-line-border.png">

        <p rend="noCount"> TO visit <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n06.html">the renowned passage of the SIMPLON</ref>,
          <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n07.html">the celebrated convent of SAINT BERNARD</ref>,
          <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n08.html">the Valley of BAGNES</ref>, scene of the most frightful disasters, or the romantic Vale of CHAMOUNI, it is necessary, on quitting the <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n09.html">PAYS DE VAUD</ref>, in Switzerland, to traverse the town of <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n10.html">SAINT MAURICE</ref>, whose ancient
          bridge of one bold arch crosses from rock to rock the rapid Rhone, which discharges itself into the Lake of Geneva.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> Near to Saint Maurice is the beautiful cascade called the <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n11.html">PIESVACHE</ref>, which precipitates itself from the
          height of eighty feet, and falls into the Rhone.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> At the distance of eight miles is <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n12.html">the town of MARTIGNY</ref>, the resort of the neighbouring villagers for the purpose of selling the produce of the adjacent vallies: fruit, game,
          butter, cheese, honey, or of bartering for commodities, of which they stand in need. This town consists of 2500 inhabitants, and is {9}
          situated on the Rhone, at the junction of three vallies; one of which, leading to the SIMPLON, discovers to the astonished eye of the
          traveller, <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n13.html">the herculean works of NAPOLEON BUONAPARTE</ref>; who, to open a passage for his army to the
          delightful plains of Italy, with incredible labour and perseverance, perforated rocks of 750 feet in thickness; thereby enabling his
          soldiers to avoid <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n14.html">precipices, which thrilled the boldest heart with terror</ref>, and march in perfect safety.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> The second valley, after following for some distance the course of a river called, <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n15.html">the DRANSE</ref>, branches off into two smaller vallies; one of which leads to <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n16.html">the memorable, but dangerous
            pass of Saint Bernard, through which HANNIBAL and his Carthaginian Warriors penetrated to Italy</ref>; and where, isolated amid eternal snows, stands the celebrated and hospitable convent of that name, <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n17.html">whose dogs</ref>, of an uncommon size, trained to carry baskets of
          provisions, have oft, by instinct, discovered and rescued the benighted traveller, who, bewildered in the trackless snow, must otherwise
          have perished.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> The other branch conducts – no longer to the lovely valley of Bagnes, smiling in gay luxuriance, the abode of health and peace, where,
          welcoming each stranger as a friend, the cottagers’ doors flew open, the frugal fare was served, and, adoring the bounteous hand of nature,
          all slept in peace, but – O Providence! how mysterious are thy ways! – to a frightful waste, a desert, where, mingled in wild confusion, are
          seen fragments of trees, masses of rock and ice, the refuse of the torrent; – the fields, the vineyards, meadows, villages, have <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n18.html">“vanished like the baseless fabric of a vision,”</ref> and the enlivening

        <p rend="noCount"> This hapless valley, containing twelve towns and villages, is twenty miles in length, and bounded by towering rocks and stupendous

          to horror, for in thy own bosom lurked, unheard, unseen, the fiend of desolation, which in one frightful moment laid waste thy verdant

          despair!!</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> The river Dranse, already mentioned, after traversing the little <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n23.html">Valley of Torembec</ref>, where it takes its rise, waters that of Bagnes. At the junction of these two
          vallies, over which a bridge is thrown, ninety feet in height, the lofty mountains of Mauvoisin and Montpleureur suddenly contract, and
          descending abruptly towards the river, divide the Vallies of Bagnes and Torembec. On this spot originated the evil, which has desolated the
          former valley, and plunged {11} its inhabitants into irremediable woe. Here, resting on the abrupt declivity of Montpleureur, was formed <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n24.html">THE FATAL GLACIER of GETROZ</ref>. As this immense body of ice, impelled by its own weight, imperceptibly glided down the mountain,
          its extremity over-hung the intervening rocks, whence large masses of ice detached themselves, and, with a thundering noise, rolled into the
          valley.</p>
        <p rend="noCount">
          <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n25.html">It is said, that five years ago, owing to the heat, the Glacier was greatly reduced but the intenseness of the
            winters of 1816 and 1817 increased it to an alarming degree</ref>; this accumulation of weight naturally facilitated its movement; the rocks, which
          project from the mountain’s side and overhang the river, were unable to stem its progress, and enormous fragments of the Glacier fell in
          rapid succession into the valley, and almost choaked the current of the Dranse.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> On the 15th of May, 1818, the villagers of the Valley of Bagnes, on quitting their peaceful homes to pursue their daily labours, perceived
          the bed of the river nearly dry: the alarm was spread; the consternation became general; they hurried to a projecting rock, called <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n26.html">the Oratoire</ref>, which overlooks the valley and
          perceived, with indescribable terror, that during the night the whole of the Glacier of Getroz had detached itself from the mountain, and
          precipitated itself into the narrow passage of the Vallies of Bagnes and Torembec; blocking up the river Dranse, which already formed a lake
          of considerable extent.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> Information of this disaster was instantly communicated to the Government at Saint Maurice, which deputed <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n27.html">able engineers</ref> to hasten to the spot, and adopt measures to avert the impending danger.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> On examining this Glacier, or mountain of ice, it was found to be 400 feet in height, 600 feet in length, and at its base 2000 feet in
          thickness. The lake, which was rapidly increasing, and had gradually submerged the hamlets and meadows of the little Valley of Torembec, was
          already 300 feet in depth, 600 feet in breadth, and 7000 feet in length. {12}</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> The necessity of perforating a gallery, or outlet, 50 feet above the level of the lake, became apparent; numbers of robust and hardy
          villagers presented themselves for the arduous enterprise; some were stationed at the mouth of, and round about the gallery to apprize the
          workmen of any danger arising from the repeated blows of their axes and hammers, which reverberating, as they advanced, with a noise of
          thunder, detached immense masses of ice from the summit of the Glacier: others were occupied in removing the rubbish from the gallery, and
          precipitating it down its sides. Day and night their labours were unceasing, and with incredible danger and fatigue, they succeeded in
          excavating through solid ice as clear as chrystal, and so hard that it often broke the axe, an aperture four feet broad, six feet high, AND
            <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n28.html">600 FEET IN LENGTH</ref>.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> The lake continued to increase, and on the 13th of June it rose to a level with the gallery, and precipitated itself into the bed of the
          river Dranse; forming cascade 350 feet in height; a scene as magnificent, as unprecedented.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> On the 14th of June it was discovered, that fragments of ice, which detached themselves from the summit of the Glacier and floated on the
          lake, had entered the gallery and blocked up its passage; the villagers, however, at the hazard of their lives, and with a courage bordering
          on despair, succeeded in removing them, and the lake continued to flow. On the 15th of June, the river Dranse attained its usual height, and
          the villagers retired to rest, in the hope that success had crowned their labours, and that danger was no more.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> Their hopes, alas! were vain: <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n29.html">THE FIAT HAD GONE FORTH</ref>; – even then the swift-winged messenger of
          death hovered around, and marked them for his prey: – mysterious providence, how wonderful are thy ways! – could not their innocence, –
          their upright manners, integrity of soul and strict obedience to thy sacred will avert the dreadful mandate? – no crime was theirs; – no
          visitings of remorse; – no fears disturbed their peaceful slumbers; their hearts were pure, their consciences at rest, and yet, – BUT WHO
          SHALL DARE TO ARRAIGN OMNIPOTENCE, {13} OR SAY “WHY DOST THOU SO?” – ’TIS THINE, SUPREME, TO FULMINATE THY DREAD COMMANDS; ’TIS OURS TO OBEY
          IN SILENCE, AND ADORE.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> Notwithstanding the apparent security, signals were established on the summits of the mountains to warn the inhabitants in case of danger;
          by such precautions they flattered themselves to save their lives at least, if not their little property; but the Hour was come; – the
          torrent itself was the precursor of ruin, and in one moment the havoc was complete; the steps taken to prevent the increase of the lake,
          which finally burst upon this devoted valley, could not avert the fatal calamity; this immense body of water opened itself a passage BENEATH
          the mountain of ice, and then began the work of desolation.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> A forest of trees and a village, situated near the fatal Glacier, were swept away; – not one villager escaped: – not a vestige remains –
          but large masses of ice and rock alone mark the spot. At <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n30.html">Champsal</ref> fifty-two houses have disappeared, and the soul-piercing cries of the
          drowning inhabitants were distinctly heard amid the devastating element; every town, every village has suffered more or less; the greater
          part of Bagnes, of <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n31.html">Saint Bianchi</ref>, of <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n32.html">Beauverniers</ref>, and of <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n33.html">Martigny</ref>, is totally destroyed. In this last town, distant from the
          fatal Glacier twenty-four miles, the water rose to the height of fourteen feet, and a rock, fifty-two feet in circumference, was borne along
          by the torrent, and left in the market-place: some English travellers, whose curiosity induced them to visit the fatal Glacier, were warned
          of their danger by the thunder proceeding from the bursting of the waters beneath the mountain of ice, and they had just time to dismount
          from their mules and climb the neighbouring acclivity, when the foaming torrent rolled at their feet: in many places, where the projecting
          rocks formed obstacles to the dreadful element, broken trees, masses of ice, drowned cattle, and furniture of every description,
          intermingled with the afflicting spectacle of human bodies, were heaped to the height of fifty feet. The whole of this once fertile valley
          is irrecoverably lost. The {14} extent of the damage, and the number, who have perished, is uncertain; the destruction is more prodigious
          and terrific than can be conceived by the most ardent imagination; and it will give the reader some idea of the rapidity of this dreadful
          torrent, when informed, that it traversed a distance of <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n34.html">TWENTY FOUR miles, in the short space of EIGHTY
            MINUTES</ref>.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> All communication with this hapless valley, excepting over the almost impassable mountains, was long impracticable, and many, who escaped
          the horrors of the flood, perished from want: the wretched villagers are to this hour employed in the heart-rending task of removing
          fragments of rock and ice, and the wrecks of their once peaceful homes, in search of the dead bodies of their beloved relatives; but the
          greater part, alas! perished in the waters.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> But time, perhaps, which heals the wounds of suffering humanity, may pour its balm into their lacerated bosoms. Ah no! no! <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n35.html">“hope, which comes to all, comes not to them,”</ref> – the Glacier, The FATAL GLACIER

          cold and silence.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> This romantic valley, eighteen miles in length, but not more than half a mile in breadth, is situated at the foot of MONT BLANC; its form
          is an arc, of which the MONT BLANC occupies a considerable portion of its convex, and the lofty BREVEN of its concave. At the commencement
          of the eighteenth century it was so little known, that when the celebrated traveller, <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n51.html">Pocock, and an
            Englishman of the name of Wyndham</ref>, impelled by
          an ardent desire to approach the MONT BLANC, which towers above the clouds, resolved to explore its vicinity, they expected to find the
          inhabitants uncivilised, – ferocious; and they armed themselves and their attendants from top to toe, to resist any moderate force which
          might be brought against them.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> But how agreeably were they surprised on finding a people whose manners, tho’ <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n52.html">rude</ref>, breathed the spirit of peace: the strangers were welcomed
          with hospitality; they were conducted to the motionless waves and yawning chasms of <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n53.html">THE SEA OF ICE</ref>; – <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n54.html">THE EVER-VERDANT GARDEN, CASED IN ETERNAL SNOW</ref>; – THE {17} GROTTO OF L’ARVEIRON; – <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n55.html">THE GLACIERS OF MONT-BLANC</ref>: and they returned, charmed with their reception and
          penetrated with the wonders of this valley.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> The account given by these Englishmen was electric. Travellers of every nation have since, during the summers, frequented the valley; and
          Chamouni, (or the <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n56.html">Prieure’</ref>), formerly a miserable village, is now a considerable town, with <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n57.html">two excellent Inns</ref>, and not only the
          conveniences, but the luxuries of life.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> There are eleven villages, the principal of which is Chamouni; the inhabitants (about 5000), are frugal and honest: their minds active and
          lively; and their tempers gay, inclining to raillery; of course, the fears of the two Englishmen are a never-failing source of amusement,
          especially to the old mountaineers, who still laugh and joke at their formidable, but <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n58.html">unnecessary
            precautions</ref>.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> Altho’ the concourse of strangers, and the money they leave behind them, have somewhat affected the ancient simplicity of these people,
          and even the purity of their manners, nobody has anything to fear from them; the most inviolable fidelity is observed, and travellers are
          merely exposed to the importunate solicitations of those, who eagerly offer their services <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n59.html">as

          AVALANCHES, which roll from the mountains and defy the summers’ heat, are of matchless richness and verdure.</p>
        <p rend="noCount">
          <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n61.html">Chrystals</ref> are here found in all their purity, and the hope of enriching
          themselves by the discovery of chrystal caverns, is so powerful a motive, that the inhabitants expose themselves in the search to the most
          alarming dangers, and often perish in the snow, or are precipitated down the precipices.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> The indications of these grottos of chrystal are white veins of quartz, which appear on the surface of the rocks, chiefly in inaccessible
          places; the villagers arrive at them by hewing paths across the Glaciers, or suspending themselves by {18} ropes over the most frightful
          precipices: – when they reach the spot, they strike the rock, and if it return a hollow sound, they open it with a hammer, or blow it up
          with gunpowder.</p>

          dangerous, and carries off, in the flower of their age, many, whose lives are invaluable to their families. The hunter sets out at night to
          gain the elevated spots, where the chamois feed; – here, concealed behind a rock, the snow his bed, a stone his pillow, he resigns himself
          to sleep, from which the morning dew awakes him: at length the mountain-goats arrive, and whilst one of them stations himself on a spiring
          rock to give the alarm, the others browse and alternately relieve the sentinel: the slightest noise suffices to rouse them to a sense of
          danger, and with incredible velocity, they bound over chasms of snow and ice, followed by the intrepid hunter, who carefully marks their
          tracks and pursues, during several days, the chace, regardless of his family, who await his return with trembling anxiety.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> Sometimes the chamois, after skirting on a narrow ridge a dangerous abyss, find themselves on the brink of a precipice, whence there is no
          retreating but by the road they came: here the hunter’s danger is most imminent; the chamois, no longer timid, boldly advance to meet the
          enemy, who fires, and by throwing himself prostrate, sometimes escapes destruction, as the chamois would, otherwise, force a passage between
          the hunter and the overhanging rock, and hurl him down the precipice.</p>
        <p rend="noCount">
          <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n63.html">The infatuation of the inhabitants</ref> for this chace, borders on

          me.” His prophecy was accomplished; – on the morrow he departed – never to return – after a long search, he was found at the foot of a

          therefore, insist on the strictest adherence to rules, necessary for self-preservation, and enjoin the profoundest silence.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> A melancholy circumstance which lately occurred, illustrates, beyond the power of words, the necessity of conforming to the guides’
          precautions. A traveller and his son explored the interior of the cavern – the usual warning, during their subterranean research, was
          rigidly observed; but, on returning to the entrance, the youth, actuated by curiosity to witness the effect of sound, fired a pistol; the
          thunder, proceeding from the falling of the stalactites and masses of ice in and around the cavern, resembled the repeated discharges of
          artillery, and, horrible to relate, the son was literally cleft in twain by the edge of a <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n68.html">ponderous
            icicle</ref>, which shattered the arm of his
          agonized father.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> The guides escaped by miracle; but the dreadful scene is traced in characters indelible on their memories, and they prefer braving the
          dangers attendant on the ascent to the summit of Mont-Blanc, rather than revisit this fatal cavern. {20}</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> On arriving at the foot of the COL-DE BALME, you skirt the rapid Arve, which traverses the valley; now, gliding thro’ a deep, but level
          bed, now, dashing thro’ fragments of rocks, foaming and boiling in its descent; then, expanding, it overflows a large portion of the plain,
          and returning to its channel, meanders in conjunction with L’ARVEIRON thro’ the valley.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> As you advance, the wildest tracts border on the richest pastures; – eternal ice and snow intermingle with verdure, vying with the
          emerald; – larch-trees and black pines clothe the mountains’ sides, whence, in formidable array, and stretching far into the valley, as if
          to dispute the passage, appear</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center"><emph rendition="#large">The Glaciers</emph>,</p>
        <p rend="noCount">or pyramids of ice, not smooth and slippery, but rough and porous.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> That these Glaciers <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n69.html">increase and decrease</ref>, is
          evident from the following circumstance: their borders are skirted with trees, some of which are eighty feet in height, and of a great age:
          between these and the Glaciers are trees of a later growth, which have been overturned by the ice; hence it is clear that the ice once
          extended to the trees of larger growth, and as it dissolves or retires a number of trees shoot up on the spot which it occupied, and as the
          Glaciers again advance, they in their turn are enveloped and overthrown.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> The Glaciers are of two descriptions – those occupying the deep vallies, situated in the bosom of the Alps, many leagues in length,
          intersected with large crevices from 100 to 600 feet in depth, and distinguished by the name of Ice-vallies: others, emerging from the snow,
          which clothes the mountains’ sides, and assuming the appearance of pyramids or ruins.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> The Glaciers of Chamouni are of the latter description. These vast masses of ice, resting on an inclined plane, are impelled forward by
          their own weight, and being weakly resisted by the intervening rocks, they imperceptibly advance into the plain, threatening in time to
          obstruct the course of the rapid ARVE; altho’, {21} from the breadth of the valley, the same disaster, which has lately desolated the once
          fertile valley of Bagnes, is, happily, not to be apprehended.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> On approaching the town of Chamouni, the rocks assume the appearance of mouldering fortifications, or rise in <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n70.html">spiring needles</ref>, which pierce the clouds; frequently huge fragments detach themselves from
          their summits, and bound from precipice to precipice, but ’ere they reach the plain, they are shivered into dust.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> Here, the rippling stream modestly announces its approach; – there, the torrent precipitates itself from the mountains’ height, and its
          thunder is increased by the devastating</p>
        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#center"><emph rendition="#large">Avalanches</emph>,</p>
        <p rend="noCount">which are formed in the following manner: the snow, that lodges on the pinnacles of the rocks, accumulating, at length falls, and rolling
          down the declivity, increases to an enormous size, sweeping before it forests and rocks, and overwhelming villages in its furious
          career.</p>

        <p rend="noCount"> To guard against these disasterous events, the mountaineers encourage the growth of trees, particularly around the villages and on the
          sides of the mountains, whence the danger is apprehended; – they are preserved with reverential awe, and have often diminished, if not
          entirely averted the dreadful calamity – thus, what contributes to the beauty of the vallies, affords security to the inhabitants.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> Impressed with admiration, awe, and reverence, the mind, overpowered by the wonders of nature, willingly escapes from the tumults

        </p>
        <p rend="noCount">This lofty mountain is <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n73.html">7086 feet</ref> in height; its rugged aspect and steep ascent
          repels, rather than invites the traveller – in itself it is destitute of all attraction, but nature has abundantly compensated, by placing
          it in a situation of matchless beauty and grandeur: it rises in the centre of an amphitheatre, original in the universe, in which nature has
          lavished her wonders, and appears to have set bounds even to her own creative powers.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> My pen trembles to proceed! – altho’, <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n74.html">after a lapse of twenty years</ref>, the impression on my senses at the recollection of
          this romantic valley is still the same, yet I feel, forcibly feel the presumption of attempting to delineate, where the discordant scenes of
          pastoral beauty – eternal ice – devastating torrents – murmuring streams – overhanging rocks – sloping lawns and snow-clad mountains, strive
          for pre-eminence; memory is my guide, and if I fail correctly to portray, the wish to please, at least, will not be wanting,</p>
        <p rend="noCount">
          <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n75.html">“Soon as meek-ey’d morn her rosy steps advancing, strews the earth with orient pearls,”</ref> you leave the town of Chamouni, and at once enter on the steep ascent, which continues, without
          the slightest variation, almost to the top of the mountain, when the eye is agreeably surprised by a verdant plain, covered with cattle.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> From this plain rises a craggy rock, called <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n76.html">“la Cheminee”</ref>, which must be scaled to reach
          the summit of the BREVEN.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> Here, an almost boundless view presents itself: – unable for a single instant to repose, the eye wanders from dark and towering needles,
          that pierce the clouds, to the placid lake, which skirts the Pays-de-Vaud, whose numerous vineyards, villages and towns, appearing in
          succession, beautify the landscape; – thence, {23} it glances on the distant mountains of the <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n77.html">Jura</ref>, which on that side bound the prospect, and
          descending, dwells with pleasure on the territory of <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n78.html">Geneva</ref>, a republic famed for industry, its love of glorious liberty, and justly proud of its independence.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> Fatigued with attempting to discriminate distant objects, the eye awhile reposes on the COL-DE-BALME, and then embarks on the region of
          everlasting snow and ice, thro’ which in proud defiance rise the spire-like rocks of ARGENTIERES and DU TOURS, and the cloud-capt summit of
          LE GEANT.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> Next, in its full extent, and clad in all its terrors, the SEA OF ICE appears; its waves are clearly discernible, and fancy gives them
          motion. This valley of ice, twenty miles in circumference and <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n79.html">600 feet in thickness</ref>, is bounded by a circular and hollow rock, enclosing a mass of pure, unbroken snow, called the <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n80.html">TACUL</ref>, surrounded by large conical points, like towers on an ancient
          fortification – to the right, a range of magnificent peakes, the intervals filled with masses of suspended ice, which, disengaging
          themselves from their heights, are dashed with thundering violence on the SEA OF ICE, and buried in its chasms.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> The appearance of the SEA OF ICE is indeed tremendous; numerous and broad chasms intersect it in every direction, rendering the attempt to
          cross it apparently impracticable; still, courage and activity accomplish the task, and large pointed nails in the shoes and spiked sticks
          are found to be particularly serviceable.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> But to what reflections may not the DRUIDS’ POINT give rise? – this towering needle is situated on an eminence, which overhangs THE SEA OF
          ICE, from the name it was once, perhaps, sacred to religious purposes and around its base the dark and lofty pines concealed <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n81.html">the Druids’ mysteries</ref>. The
          guides relate <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n82.html">a melancholy proof</ref> of the audacity, or rather madness of two travellers, who defied each other to scale its point; one of them
          succeeded, but in the act of exultation over his comrade, who had almost attained the summit {24} he became giddy; – he fell; – and his neck
          coming in contact with a projecting rock, his head was severed from his body and flew to an incredible distance from the spot.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> To the right of THE SEA OF ICE, and stretching down the sides of the MONT BLANC into the valley of Chamouni, appear the Glaciers of <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n83.html">les Pelerins</ref>, – of <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n84.html">du Bossons</ref>,

            <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n88.html">Bionassy</ref> – the eye follows them alternately, then,
          gradually rising, continues its course, and, at length, loses itself in the clouds.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> Yes! – there, towering in sullen majesty, fronting THE BREVEN, – in all its grandeur, in all its horrors, mantled with eternal snow and
          ice, the region of cold and silence, stands the <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n89.html">almost inaccessible</ref> MONT BLANC, – the gigantic monarch of the vale; – such is its magnitude, that at its presence
          the circumjacent mountains seem to shrink before him, and <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n90.html">“hide their diminished heads;”</ref> the path leading to its summit is carefully pointed out by the guides,
          but the mind is too much enrapt in meditation on this colossal mountain, this mighty mass, to spare the least attention; – this alone amply
          repays your toil and danger, and insensible, indeed, must that heart be, which overflows not with adoration before the wondrous works of THE
          CREATOR.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> But the silence, the effect of awe, that pervades the breast of those, whose eyes are rivetted on this stupendous mountain, is suddenly
          broken by the lowing of the herds, which graze the little plain beneath your feet and haste to crowd together: a rumbling noise, re-echoed
          by the rocks, leave it doubtful whether it be caused by THE AVALANCHE, rebounding from rock to rock, or by the distant thunder; – the sound
          approaches and a mist, like flakes of cotton, with white and rolling clouds, announce the thunder-storm; – soon the valley disappears, and
          at your feet, whilst all above is sunshine, the tempest spends its fury.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> The forked lightnings are perceptible by bright and vivid flashes, which flit along, succeeded by a pealing crash and rapid motion on the
          surface of the {25} thunder-cloud, a portion of which, as from the cannon’s mouth, darts upwards and dissolves in air: the discharge of the
          electric fluid is followed by an universal commotion of the surrounding clouds, which, rolling over each other, assume the most fantastic
          forms: these thunder-storms are usually preceded by an awful stillness and closeness of the atmosphere; soon, however, the shrubs are
          stripped of their boughs and foliage; – the rocks and trees shivered by the electric flash and huge fragments driven to an amazing distance,
          and with dreadful velocity thro’ the air, whilst tremendous peals of thunder, reverberated by the mountains, render the scene awfully
          sublime.</p>

        <p rend="noCount"> The effect of the thunder-storm is instantaneous; the path by which you ascended to the summit of THE BREVEN is, now, a water-course,

          heat of the Meridian sun, are the ravings of these spirits; and as it is a well-known fact that the Glaciers rise and fall, advance, and
          then recede, it is occasioned by an universal struggle of these impious spirits to escape from their cold and dreary prisons: but their
          efforts serve to increase their torments, by condensing more closely the ice-mountains, which envelop them.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> In those masses of snow, the remains of the Avalanches, which encumber the verdant meadows, and defy the summers’ heat, are incarcerated

          gaudy banner, reeking with human gore? – No more the marshalled legions, the licenced murderers swarm around them and obey their nod: –
          beneath their snowy prisons’ shade, screened from the mid-day sun, the shepherds and their flocks repose in safety; and instead of glowing
          at the war-denouncing trumpets’ sound, the infuriate spirits of these mighty conquerors are roused to frenzy by the music of the pastoral
          pipes, breathing the airs of happiness and peace.</p>

          with a portion of these groveling spirits, instead of solid ice, are soft and porous; – in spring, to preserve the corn from sudden frosts,
          the Mountaineers strew their fields with the substance of these Glaciers; this disgraceful proceeding takes place in the vicinity of the

          endeavoured, but in vain, to trace the footsteps of his companions; – the darkness increased, and not daring to advance, he was necessitated
          to pass the night on the mountain, and as sleep on these heights was presumed to be mortal, he was supposed to have perished.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> On the following day, instead of returning to the valley, this hardy mountaineer undauntedly ventured to explore <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n131.html">these unknown and solitary regions</ref>; – his
          courage was rewarded by the discovery of a path which led to the summit of the mountain, and he returned to CHAMOUNI, his lips swelled with
          cold; almost blinded by the dazzling whiteness of the snow, and his face excoriated by the finer particles of ice, which the wind

        <p rend="noCount"> But the most daring attempt to overtop this gigantic monarch of the vale, was made from THE WHITE VALLEY; – history has carefully
          registered the name of JAMES BALMAT, who first trod the summit of this mountain, whilst the names of those who, with a courage supernatural,
          scaled the dreadful precipice, which defies the eagles’ flight, are buried in oblivion.

          certain destruction.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> These Mountaineers, however, succeeded in their noble daring: with perseverance and courage for their guide, they scaled the frightful
          precipice; they reached its utmost height, and standing on the brink, measured with a steady eye its vast abyss – they shouted “Victory,”
          and eager to attain their wishes, continued their course, vying with each other for the glory of first reaching the mountain’s summit; but
          what a scene awaited them – in an instant they shrunk aghast, transfixed with horror; chasms of ice, which, however broad, no eye could
          fathom, crossed their path, and unwilling to retrace their steps, providence conducted them by LE GEANT, the SEA OF ICE, and the <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n134.html">MONTANVERT</ref>, in safety to the VALLEY of CHAMOUNI. {34}</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> To scale this gigantic mountain, to which <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n135.html">“many are called, but few are chosen,”</ref> it is
          necessary to procure guides, who are perfect masters of their business: armed with hatchets, cords, and long poles, pointed with iron at one
          end, and on the other a hook, they carry the provisions and a tent, as the third day of peril and fatigue will scarcely bring the travellers
          to the summit.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> But for the danger of being enveloped in the dense clouds, which unexpectedly roll around the mountain’s sides, and during their progress
          compel the daring adventurers to remain immoveable, few provisions would be necessary, since the <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n136.html">rarification
            of the atmosphere</ref>, after the first day’s march, greatly diminishes the appetite,
          but produces an ardent thirst, accompanied by a pulsation, which, on the mountain’s top, beats with double rapidity.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> The guides never lose sight of the traveller; in dangerous passes they support him with their poles extended on each side, or even bear
          him in their arms; but on approaching certain chasms of immeasurable depth, over which a narrow ridge of ice is the only passage, they
          oblige him to regard for some time <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n137.html">the vast abyss</ref>, during which they watch his countenance, and
          easily discern, whether he may venture to place his foot on the small hollow, hewn in the centre of these ridges, and vault across. The
          slightest irresolution visible in the traveller, has often determined the guides, notwithstanding the most lucrative offers, to return to
          Chamouni.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> But the guides’ experience only extends to <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n138.html">the line of march</ref>, since the dreadful
          hurricanes, accompanied with snow-storms, which delight to lord it over the upper regions of this colossal mountain, not only sweep away all
          trace of former footsteps, but change the aspect of the place.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> On quitting the town of CHAMOUNI, the road conducts to the little village of DES BOSSONS, whence a narrow path leads to the Glaciers of
          that name. By a gentle ascent, you arrive at the <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n139.html">Hamlet of DU MONT</ref>; it

        <p rend="noCount"> On following the course of the torrent of TACONA, you arrive at an abrupt and wild ascent, facing the Glaciers of that name, bristling

        <p rend="noCount"> On arriving at the termination of this frightful Glacier, joy brightens every countenance, and hilarity is the order of the day; the
          provisions are spread, and whilst some are occupied in preparing the chafing dish to procure water by melting the snow: others, in case the
          weather is serene, satisfy their burning thirst by throwing snow-balls against the rocks, which, thawed by the sun, descend in small
          channels, and afford a moderate supply.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> At length, you reach the chain of rocks that border the perpetual snows of MONT BLANC, and mount in a serpentine direction to the first of
          the three plains of snow, which conduct to the highest pinnacle of the mountain; the surface has numerous fissures, penetrating to a vast
          depth, and disclosing in their broken sides the successive layers of snow which are annually forming.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> With great fatigue you arrive at the second plain of snow, which is very shelving, and where you are in danger, especially during a high
          wind, from the devastating Avalanches, which, bounding from rock to rock, sweep all before them in their fury, and spread themselves over
          the valley.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> Here, the following <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n156.html">melancholy circumstance</ref> took
          place: – an English nobleman, who, with several of his countrymen and guides, attempted to scale the mountain, having advanced far beyond
          the rest, indulged himself in hurling snow balls: which, accumulating with rapidity, overwhelmed three guides, the fathers of families, for
          whom this nobleman, (the least he could do), most liberally provided.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> The snow is here of the most dazzling whiteness, forming a singular contrast with the sky, which, from the rarification of the air,
          appears almost black; – no living creature, no trace of vegetation is seen; and the eye, fatigued with {39} the white glare, reposes with
          pleasure on points of rocks, that appear like small islands amid a world of snow.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> The boundary of this plain terminates THE SECOND DAY’S FATIGUE.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> Immediately the guides are busied in excavating under the snow an aperture for the tent, to protect themselves, during the night, from the
          piercing wind and cold, which is almost insupportable; – there, huddled together in this region of eternal silence, uncertain, whether
          chance has not directed them to a spot, beneath which yawns an abyss, which may engulf them, or the deep and unseen AVALANCHE o’erwhelm them
          in its fury, they ruminate their danger, and anxiously await the morning’s dawn.</p>
        <p rend="noCount">
          <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n157.html">The heat, at length, becomes oppressive, and obliges for an instant to quit the tent</ref>; – then, what an awful scene awaits them! – what room for
          meditation! – how tranquil all around, save where, resistless in its course, the thundering AVALANCHE, with lightnings’ speed, sweeps on the
          vale, or dashing from the precipices’ height, remounts in showers of silver; – the plain is long since wrapt in darkness, still in the west
          the sun’s last rays are seen flaming with red and gold; – in the midst of a sky, as black as ebony, embossed with stars more brilliant than
          the ruby, emerald or sapphire, and distant worlds <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n158.html">outlustering</ref> far the diamond’s vivid blaze, the moon, refulgent orb of
          night, rising in cloudless majesty, appears in all her splendour, and illumes the deep serene; – her circle, in transparency and beauty, <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n159.html">vying with the bow of Iris</ref>: a misty sea, chequered with glittering flakes of snow and vapours of a silvery hue, thro’ which the
          mountaintops appear like islands, rests on the valley, and partially conceals the midnight landscape – the clouds, which roll around the
          mountain’s sides, agitated by the wind, assume the most fantastic forms; – now, impelled by a nether current of air, darting upwards; –
          then, meeting in apparent conflict; – now, rising into columns and mouldering ruins, or darting forwards with rapidity, whilst others are
          immoveable; – then, driven by the wind, they blend and rapidly {40} disappear, when the black pines, whose perpendicular stems rise thick
          and high amid the dark shades, assume a yellow verdure, and the spiring rocks and mountains appearing in succession, flame with the moon’s
          silver light, which, fading in the distance, imperceptibly loses itself in darkness.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> O Nature! how beauteous are thy works! – at sight of thee my bosom heaves; thoughts crowd too rapidly for utterance, and tears are my
          relief; I prostrate myself in the dust, and silently adore THE GREAT SUPREME, parent of light and life; – regardless of thy charms, O
          Nature! the soul, enslaved by furious passions, feels not the bliss which thou affordst; – happy is he, whose mind is undisturbed by fell
          remorse; – the morning wakes to joy; – the day is sacred to deeds of virtue, and the shades of night, shrouding him in peaceful slumbers,
          present celestial images to his imagination.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> Such are the dreams of the Virtuous; and thou, presumptuous mortal, who boastest a superior understanding, but over whom the unlettered
          savage justly claims pre-eminence; – thou, – atheist! wouldst thou by artful sophistry and <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n160.html">a tale well
            told, where flowers conceal the wily serpent</ref>,
          deprive him of his dearest consolation, THAT, which RELIGION GIVES – unhappy man, be near when death, relentless tyrant, marks THE CHRISTIAN
          for his prey; – no visitings of remorse, no fears disturb him, and his last sigh breathes hope of IMMORTALITY: – but when <title level="m">the Atheist</title> dies, what fears convulse his bosom! – <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n162.html">“horror and doubt distract his troubled thoughts,
            and stir the hell within him; conscience wakes despair, that slumbered; wakes the bitter memory, the dread of what assuredly must
            be”</ref>; his tongue, which dared prophane RELIGION, denies in death the actions of his life, murmuring a
          prayer for mercy to <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n163.html">“the Divinity, which speaks within him; which points out an HEREAFTER, and intimates
            ETERNITY to Man.”</ref>
</p>
        <p rend="noCount">
          <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n164.html">The first beams</ref> of the sun arouse the travellers to resume their toil, and enter on the third and
          last plain of snow, the ascent to which is so steep, that the guides are obliged to hew out footsteps with their hatchets, and the air so
          rarefied, that after taking a few steps, you are necessitated to rest. {41}</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> In <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n165.html">two hours more</ref> you reach THE
          SUMMIT OF MONT BLANC, when the whole appears a dream, and, for awhile, it is <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n166.html">impossible to analyse your ideas
            sufficiently</ref> to enjoy the unbounded
          prospect.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> With difficulty you distinguish the majestic peakes of L’AIGUILLES, MIDI, ARGENTIERES, and LE GEANT, – no longer frowning, as if proud of
          their towering heights, but sunk to an almost level, and scarcely discernible from their humble neighbours; –even the lofty BREVEN, appears
          but a trifling variation from the plain, that uninterruptedly extends to the lake of Geneva, beyond which, as over a rivulet, the view
          stretches across Swisserland, and loses itself insensibly in the distant provinces of France and Italy.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> Wherever the eye is directed, a vast plain presents itself; but, as from the intenseness of the cold it is <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n167.html">impossible to remain</ref> here long, the guides are
          unable to point out, with accuracy, details of this boundless prospect.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> The summit of the mountain, which is visible at the distance of sixty eight leagues, or 204 miles, is <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n168.html">so
            narrow, as scarcely to permit two persons to walk abreast</ref>; – especially on <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n169.html">the West side</ref>, which is very steep, and terminates in the frightful precipices that
          bound THE WHITE VALLEY.</p>
        <p rend="noCount">
          <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n170.html">To the rarefaction of the air</ref> is
          to be attributed the burning thirst; – fire can scarcely be maintained in <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n171.html">the chafing dish</ref>, and instead of a few minutes, <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n172.html">half an hour is requisite to boil water</ref>; – hence the
          difficulty of breathing and consequent rapidity of pulsation; – from the same cause, the sky appears almost black; – through <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n173.html">a tube</ref>, the stars are always visible; and, as on this isolated spot, there are no echoes to repel
          the sound, the report of a pistol is only equal to <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n174.html">a Chinese cracker</ref>.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> The appetite is lost; – wine and spirits are loathed, nothing but water is coveted; and <ref rend="colorbox-node" target="/editions/chamouni/chamouni_n175.html">so piercing is the
            cold, that the provisions are entirely frozen, and the ink congealed in the inkhorns</ref>.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> Experience has proved the advantage of wearing green veils in the ascent, without which the dazzling whiteness of the snow would be
          insupportable, and the face excoriated by the finer particles of ice, which are incessantly floating in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> The descent, owing to its steepness, would, but for the guides’ assistance, be extremely dangerous. The night is usually passed on the
          upper side of the frightful Glacier, already mentioned; and on the following day, you return to the Valley of CHAMOUNI.</p>
        <p rend="noCount"> Sweet valley, adieu!!! may thy peasants resist the baneful effects of luxury, which the influx of strangers pours into thy bosom – and may
          their hearts remain pure, unsullied, as the snows, which mantle thy almost inaccessible mountains.</p>
