                connection with my authorship alone, I can scarcely accuse myself of a personal intrusion.</p>
                
                <p>It is not singular that, as the
                    daughter of two persons of distinguished literary celebrity, I should very early in life have thought of
                    writing. As a child I scribbled; and my favourite pastime, during the hours given me for recreation, was to "write
                    stories." Still I had a dearer pleasure than this, which was the formation of castles in the air—the
                    indulging in waking dreams—the following up trains of thought, which had for their subject the formation
                    of a succession of imaginary incidents. My dreams
                    were at once more fantastic and agreeable than my writings. In the latter I was a close imitator—rather
                    doing as others had done, than putting down the suggestions of my own mind. What I wrote was intended at least for
                    one other eye—my childhood's companion and
                    friend; but my dreams were all my own; I accounted for them to nobody; they were my refuge when
                    annoyed—my dearest pleasure when free.</p>
            <p>I lived principally in the country
                as a girl, and passed a considerable time in Scotland. I made occasional visits to the more picturesque parts; but my
                habitual residence was on the blank and dreary northern shores of the Tay, near Dundee. Blank and dreary on
                retrospection I call them; they were not so to me then. They were the eyry of freedom, and the pleasant region where
                unheeded I could commune with the creatures of my fancy. I wrote then—but in a most common-place style. It
                was beneath the trees of the grounds belonging to our house, or on the bleak sides of the woodless mountains near,
                that my true compositions, the airy flights of my imagination, were born and fostered. I did not make myself the
                heroine of my tales. Life appeared to me too common-place an affair as regarded myself. I could not figure to myself
                that romantic woes or wonderful events would ever be my lot; but I was not confined to my own identity, and I could people the hours with creations far more
                interesting to me at that age, than my own sensations.</p>
                
                <p>After this my life became busier, and reality stood in place of fiction. My husband,
                    however, was from the first, very anxious that I should prove myself worthy of my parentage, and enrol myself on the page
                    of fame. He was for ever inciting me to obtain literary reputation, which even on my own part I cared for then,
                    though since I have become infinitely indifferent to it. At this time he desired that I should write, not so much
                    with the idea that I could produce any thing worthy of notice, but that he might himself judge how far I possessed
                    the promise of better things hereafter. Still I did nothing. Travelling, and the cares of a family, occupied my
                    time; and study, in the way of reading, or improving my ideas in communication with his far more cultivated mind,
                    was all of literary employment that engaged my attention. </p>
            
                <p>In the summer of 1816, we visited Switzerland, and became the neighbours of Lord Byron. At first we
                    spent our pleasant hours on the lake, or wandering on its shores; and Lord Byron, who was writing the third canto of Childe Harold, was the only one among
                    us who put his thoughts upon paper. These, as he brought them successively to us, clothed in all the light and
                    harmony of poetry, seemed to stamp as divine the glories of heaven and earth, whose influences we partook with
                    him.</p>
            
                <p>But it proved a wet, ungenial
                    summer, and incessant rain often confined us for days to the house. Some volumes of ghost stories, translated from the
                    German into French, fell into our hands. There was the History of the Inconstant Lover, who, when he thought to
                    clasp the bride to whom he had pledged his vows, found himself in the arms of the pale ghost of her whom he had
                    deserted. There was the tale of the sinful founder of his race, whose miserable doom it was to bestow the kiss of
                    death on all the younger sons of his fated house, just when they reached the age of promise. His gigantic, shadowy
                    form, clothed like the ghost in Hamlet, in complete armour, but with the beaver up, was seen at midnight, by the
                    moon's fitful beams, to advance slowly along the gloomy avenue. The shape was lost beneath the shadow of the
                    castle walls; but soon a gate swung back, a step was heard, the door of the chamber opened, and he advanced to the
                    couch of the blooming youths, cradled in healthy sleep. Eternal sorrow sat upon his face as he bent down and
                    kissed the forehead of the boys, who from that hour withered like flowers snapt upon the stalk. I have not seen
                    these stories since then; but their incidents are as fresh in my mind as if I had read them yesterday.</p>
            
                <p>"We will each write a ghost story," said Lord Byron; and his proposition was acceded to.
                    There were four of us. The noble author began a tale, a fragment of which he printed at the end of his poem of
                    Mazeppa. Shelley, more apt to embody ideas and sentiments in the radiance of brilliant imagery, commenced one
                    founded on the experiences of his early life. Poor Polidori had some terrible idea about a
                    skull-headed lady, who was so punished for peeping through a key-hole—what to see I
                    forget—something very shocking and wrong of course; but when she was reduced to a worse condition than
                    the renowned Tom of Coventry, he did not know
                    what to do with her, and was obliged to despatch her to the tomb of the Capulets, the only place for which she was fitted. The illustrious poets also, annoyed by
                    the platitude of prose, speedily relinquished the uncongenial task.</p>
            
                <p>I busied myself to think of a story, —a story to rival those which had
                    excited us to this task. One which would speak to the mysterious fears of our nature, and awaken thrilling
                    horror—one to make the reader dread to look round, to curdle the blood, and quicken the beatings of the
                    heart. If I did not accomplish these things, my ghost story would be unworthy of its name. I thought and
                    pondered—vainly. I felt that blank
                    incapability of invention which is the greatest misery of authorship, when dull Nothing replies to our
                    anxious invocations. Have you thought of a story? I was asked each morning, and each morning I was forced
                    to reply with a mortifying negative.</p>
            
                <p>Every thing must have a beginning, to speak in Sanchean phrase; and that beginning must be
                    linked to something that went before. The Hindoos give the world an elephant to support it, but they make the elephant stand upon a tortoise. Invention, it
                    must be humbly admitted, does not consist in creating out of void, but out of chaos; the materials must, in the
                    first place, be afforded: it can give form to dark, shapeless substances, but cannot bring into being the
                    substance itself. In all matters of discovery and invention, even of those that appertain to the imagination, we
                    are continually reminded of the story of Columbus and
                    his egg. Invention consists in the capacity of seizing on the capabilities of a subject, and in the power
                    of moulding and fashioning ideas suggested to it.</p>
            
                <p>Many and long were the conversations between Lord Byron and Shelley, to which I was a
                    devout but nearly silent listener. During one of these, various philosophical doctrines were discussed, and among
                    others the nature of the principle of life, and whether there was any probability of its ever being discovered and
                    communicated. They talked of the experiments of Dr.
                    Darwin, (I speak not of what the Doctor really did, or said that he did, but, as more to my purpose, of what
                    was then spoken of as having been done by him,) who preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case, till by some
                    extraordinary means it began to move with voluntary
                    motion. Not thus, after all, would life be given. Perhaps a corpse would be re-animated; galvanism had given token of such things: perhaps
                    the component parts of a creature might be manufactured, brought together, and endued with vital warmth.</p>
            
                <p>Night waned upon this talk, and even the witching hour had gone by, before we retired to
                    rest. When I placed my head on my pillow, I did not sleep, nor could I be said to think. My imagination, unbidden, possessed and guided me,
                    gifting the successive images that arose in my mind with a vividness far beyond the usual bounds of reverie. I
                    saw—with shut eyes, but acute mental vision, —I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts
                    kneeling beside the thing he had put together. I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out, and then, on the working of some powerful engine, show signs of
                    life, and stir with an uneasy, half vital motion. Frightful must it be; for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavour to mock the
                    stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world. His success would terrify the artist; he would rush away from
                    his odious handywork, horror-stricken. He would hope that, left to itself, the slight spark of life which he had
                    communicated would fade; that this thing, which had received such imperfect animation, would subside into dead
                    matter; and he might sleep in the belief that the silence of the grave would quench for ever the transient
                    existence of the hideous corpse which he had looked upon as the cradle of life. He sleeps; but he is awakened; he
                    opens his eyes; behold the horrid thing stands at his bedside, opening his curtains, and looking on him with
                    yellow, watery, but speculative eyes.</p>
            
                <p>I opened mine in terror. The idea so possessed my mind, that a thrill of fear ran through
                    me, and I wished to exchange the ghastly image of my fancy for the realities around. I see them still; the very room, the dark
                    parquet, the closed shutters, with the moonlight struggling through, and the sense I had that the
                    glassy lake and white high Alps were beyond. I could not so easily get rid of my hideous phantom; still it haunted
                    me. I must try to think of something else. I recurred to my ghost story, my tiresome unlucky ghost story! O! if I
                    could only contrive one which would frighten my reader as I myself had been frightened that night!</p>
            
                <p>Swift as light and as cheering was the idea that broke in upon me. "I have found it! What
                    terrified me will terrify others; and I need only describe the spectre which had haunted my midnight pillow." On
                    the morrow I announced that I had thought of a story. I began that day with the words, It was on a dreary night of November, making only a transcript of the grim terrors of my waking dream.</p>
            
                <p>At first I thought but of a few pages of a short tale; but Shelley urged me to develope the
                    idea at greater length. I certainly did not owe the
                    suggestion of one incident, nor scarcely of one train of feeling, to my husband, and yet but for his
                    incitement, it would never have taken the form in which it was presented. From this declaration I must except the
                    preface. As far as I can recollect, it was entirely written by him.</p>
            
                <p>And now, once again, I bid my
                    hideous progeny go forth and prosper. I have an affection for it, for it was the offspring of happy days,
                    when death and grief were but words, which found no true echo in my heart. Its several pages speak of many a walk,
                    many a drive, and many a conversation, when I was not alone; and my companion was one who, in this world, I shall
                    never see more. But this is for myself; my readers have nothing to do with these associations.</p>
            
                <p>I will add but one word as to the alterations I have made. They are principally those of
                    style. I have changed no portion of the story, nor
                    introduced any new ideas or circumstances. I have mended the language where it was so bald as to interfere with
                    the interest of the narrative; and these changes occur almost exclusively in the beginning of the first volume.
                    Throughout they are entirely confined to such parts as are mere adjuncts to the story, leaving the core and
                    substance of it untouched. </p>

                <head>Preface</head>
                <p>THE event on which this fiction is founded has been supposed, by Dr. Darwin, and some of  the physiological writers of Germany, as not of
                    impossible occurrence. I shall not be supposed as according the remotest degree of serious faith to such an
                    imagination; yet, in assuming it as the basis of a work of fancy, I have not considered myself as merely weaving a series of supernatural terrors. The
                    event on which the interest of the story depends is exempt from the disadvantages of a mere tale of spectres or
                    enchantment. It was recommended by the novelty of the situations which it developes; and, however impossible as a
                    physical fact, affords a point of view to the
                    imagination for the delineating of human passions more comprehensive and commanding than any which the
                    ordinary relations of existing events can yield.</p>
                    
                    <p>I have thus endeavoured to preserve the truth of the elementary principles of human nature, while I have not scrupled to innovate upon their
                        combinations. The Iliad, the tragic poetry of Greece, Shakespeare, in the Tempest and Midsummer
                        Night's Dream and most especially Milton, in Paradise Lost, conform to this rule; and the most
                        humble novelist, who seeks to confer or receive amusement from his labours, may, without presumption, apply to prose
                        fiction a licence, or rather a rule, from the adoption of which so many exquisite combinations of human feeling
                        have resulted in the highest specimens of poetry.</p>
                
                    <p>The circumstance on which my story rests was suggested in casual conversation. It was commenced partly as a source
                        of amusement, and partly as an expedient for exercising any untried resources of mind. Other motives were mingled
                        with these as the work proceeded. I am by no means indifferent to the manner in which whatever moral tendencies
                        exist in the sentiments or characters it contains shall affect the reader; yet my chief concern in this respect
                        has been limited to the avoiding the enervating effects of the novels of the present day, and to the exhibition of
                        the amiableness of domestic affection, and the
                        excellence of universal virtue. The opinions which naturally spring from the character and situation of the hero
                        are by no means to be conceived as existing always in my own conviction; nor is any inference justly to be drawn
                        from the following pages as prejudicing any philosophical doctrine of whatever kind.</p>
                
                    <p>It is a subject also of additional interest to the author that this story was begun in the majestic region where
                        the scene is principally laid, and in society which cannot cease to be regretted. I passed the summer of 1816 in
                        the environs of Geneva. The season was cold and rainy, and in the evenings we crowded around a blazing wood fire,
                        and occasionally amused ourselves with some German
                        stories of ghosts, which happened to fall into our hands. These tales excited in us a playful desire of
                        imitation. Two other friends (a tale from the pen of
                        one of whom would be far more acceptable to the public than any thing I can ever hope to produce) and myself
                        agreed to write each a story founded on some supernatural occurrence.</p>
                
                    <p>The weather, however, suddenly became serene; and my two friends left me on a journey among the Alps, and lost, in
                        the magnificent scenes which they present, all memory of their ghostly visions. The following tale is the only one
                        which has been completed.</p>

                <head>Letter I</head>
                <p>To Mrs. SAVILLE, England.</p>
                <p>St. Petersburgh, December 11, 17--.</p>
                <p>YOU will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an
                    enterprise which you have regarded with such evil
                    forebodings. I arrived here yesterday; and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare,
                    and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.</p>
                   
                    <p>I am already far north of London; and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play
                        upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves, and fills me with delight. Do you understand this feeling? This breeze,
                        which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my day dreams become more fervent and vivid. I try in
                        vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination
                        as the region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the
                        sun is for ever visible; its broad disk just skirting the horizon, and diffusing a perpetual splendour.
                        There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm
                        sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the
                        habitable globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies
                        undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I may
                        there discover the wondrous power which attracts the
                        needle; and may regulate a thousand celestial
                        observations, that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I
                        shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a
                        part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man. These are
                        my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death, and to induce me to commence this
                        laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an
                        expedition of discovery up his native river. But, supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest
                        the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach
                        which at present so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can
                        only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.</p>
                
                    <p>These reflections have dispelled the agitation with
                        which I began my letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven; for nothing contributes so much to tranquilise the mind as a
                        steady purpose,—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye. This expedition has been the
                        favourite dream of my early years. I have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been
                        made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole. You may
                        remember that a history of all the voyages made for
                        purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good uncle Thomas's library. My education was neglected,
                        yet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study day and night, and my familiarity with them increased
                        that regret which I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father's dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to
                        allow me to embark in a seafaring life.</p>
                
                    <p>These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose effusions entranced my soul, and lifted
                        it to heaven. I also became a poet, and for one year
                        lived in a Paradise of my own creation; I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names
                        of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well acquainted with my failure, and how heavily I bore the
                        disappointment. But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my thoughts were turned into the channel
                        of their earlier bent.</p>
                
                    <p>Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I can, even now, remember
                        the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great
                        enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied the whale-fishers on several
                        expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder
                        than the common sailors during the day, and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine,
                        and those branches of physical science from which a
                        naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an under-mate in
                        a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I must own I felt a little proud, when my captain offered
                        me the second dignity in the vessel, and entreated me
                        to remain with the greatest earnestness; so valuable did he consider my services.</p>
                
                    <p>And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose? My life might have been passed in ease
                        and luxury; but I preferred glory to every enticement
                        that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some
                        encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often
                        depressed. I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which will demand all my
                        fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are
                        failing.</p>
                
                    <p>This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly quickly over the snow in their sledges; the
                        motion is pleasant, and, in my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stage-coach. The cold is not
                        excessive, if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which I have already adopted; for there is a great
                        difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise prevents the blood
                        from actually freezing in your veins. I have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh
                        and Archangel.</p>
                
                    <p>I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my intention is to hire a ship there, which
                        can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary among
                        those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to sail until the month of June: and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how can
                        I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before you and I may meet. If I
                        fail, you will see me again soon, or never.</p>
                
                    <p>Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you, and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love
                        and kindness.</p>
                    <p> Your affectionate brother,</p>

               <head>Letter II</head>
            
            <p>To Mrs. SAVILLE, England.</p>
            <p> Archangel, 28th March, 17--.</p>
            <
                    <p> How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow! yet a second
                        step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a vessel, and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those
                        whom I have already engaged, appear to be men on whom I
                        can depend, and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage. </p>
                
                    <p> But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy; and the absence of the object of which I now feel
                        as a most severe evil. I have no friend, Margaret:
                        when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there
                        will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in
                        dejection. I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling. I desire the company of a
                        man who could sympathize with me; whose eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the
                        want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a
                        capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a friend repair the
                        faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent  in
                        execution, and too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my
                        life I ran wild on a common, and read nothing but our
                        uncle Thomas's books of voyages. At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country; but
                        it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction,
                        that I perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted
                        with more languages  than that of my native country. Now I am twenty-eight, and am in reality more illiterate
                        than many schoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more, and that my day dreams  are more extended and magnificent; but
                        they want (as the painters call it) keeping; and I greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough
                        for me to endeavour to regulate my mind.</p>
                
                    <p>Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among
                        merchants and seamen. Yet some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms.
                        My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage  and enterprise; he is madly
                        desirous of glory: or rather, to word my phrase more
                        characteristically, of advancement in his profession.
                        He is an Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains
                        some of the noblest endowments of humanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel: finding
                        that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise.</p>
                
                    <p>The master is a person of an excellent disposition, and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This
                        circumstance, added to his well known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very desirous to engage him. A
                        youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under your
                        gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character, that I cannot overcome an
                        intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on
                        board ship: I have never believed it to be necessary; and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his
                        kindliness of heart, and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in
                        being able to secure his services. I heard of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him
                        the happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady, of moderate
                        fortune; and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw his mistress once before the destined
                        ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and, throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing
                        at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never consent to the
                        union. My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover, instantly
                        abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder
                        of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase
                        stock, and then himself solicited the young woman's father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old
                        man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend; who, when he found the father inexorable,
                        quitted his country, nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her
                        inclinations. "What a noble fellow!" you will exclaim.
                        He is so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct
                        the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command.</p>
                
                    <p> Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little, or because I can conceive a consolation for my toils which I may
                        never know, that I am wavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate; and my voyage is only now delayed until
                        the weather shall permit my embarkation. The winter has been dreadfully severe; but the spring promises well, and
                        it is considered as a remarkably early season; so that, perhaps, I may sail sooner than I expected. I shall do
                        nothing rashly; you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care.</p>
                
                    <p>I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking. It is
                        impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with
                        which I am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to "the land of mist and snow;" but I shall kill no
                        albatross, therefore do not be alarmed for my safety, or if I should come back to you as worn and woful as the
                        "Ancient Mariner?" You will smile at my allusion; but I will disclose a secret. I have often attributed my
                        attachment to, my passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of the ocean, to that production of the most
                        imaginative of modern poets. There is something at work in my soul, which I do not understand. I am practically
                        industrious—pains-taking;—a workman to execute with perseverance and labour:—but
                        besides this, there is a love for the marvellous, a belief in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects,
                        which hurries me out of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited regions I am about to
                        explore. But to return to dearer considerations.</p>
                
                    <p>Shall I meet you again, after having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of Africa or America? I dare
                        not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to
                        write to me by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when I need them most to support my
                        spirits. I love you very tenderly. Remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again. </p> Your
                    affectionate brother, <p>ROBERT WALTON.</p></div>

               <head>Letter III</head>
               <p>To Mrs. SAVILLE, England.</p>
               <p> July 7th, 17--.</p>
               
                   <p>MY DEAR SISTER,</p> 
               <p>I WRITE a few lines in haste, to say that I am safe, and well advanced on my voyage. This letter will reach
                       England by a merchantman now on its homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not see my
                       native land, perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good spirits: my men are bold, and apparently firm of purpose; nor do
                       the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers of the region towards which we are
                       advancing, appear to dismay them. We have already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of summer,
                       and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales, which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire to attain,
                       breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not expected.</p>
                   
                       <p>No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter. One or two stiff gales, and the
                           springing of a leak, are accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record; and I shall be
                           well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.</p>
                   
                       <p>Adieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured, that for my own sake, as well as yours, I will not rashly encounter
                           danger. I will be cool, persevering, and prudent.</p>
                   
                       <p>But success shall crown my endeavours. Wherefore not? Thus far I have gone, tracing a secure way over
                           the pathless seas: the very stars themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. Why not still
                           proceed over the untamed yet obedient element? What can stop the determined heart and resolved will of man?
                       </p>
                   
                       <p>My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. But I must finish. Heaven bless my beloved
                           sister!<lb/>
                           <lb/>Your affectionate brother,</p>

                <head>Letter IV</head>
                <p>To Mrs. SAVILLE, England.</p>
<p>August 5th, 17--.</p>

<p>So strange an accident has happened to us, that I cannot forbear recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession.</p>

<p>Last Monday (July 31st), we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she floated. Our situation was somewhat 
    dangerous, especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to, hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.</p>

<p>About two o'clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched
out in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which
seemed to have no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own
mind began to grow watchful
with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly
attracted our attention, and diverted our solicitude from our
own situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge
and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of
half a mile: a being which had
the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature, sat
in the sledge, and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress
of the traveller with our telescopes, until he was lost among the distant
inequalities of the ice.</p>

<p>This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as  we believed, many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in reality, so distant 
    as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the greatest attention.</p>

<p>About two hours after this occurrence, we heard the ground sea; and before night the ice broke, and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the morning, fearing 
    to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to rest for a few hours.</p>

<p>In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon the deck, and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently talking to some one in the sea. 
    It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we  had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night, on a large fragment of ice.  Only one dog remained alive; but there was a 
    human being within it, whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel. He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but 
    an European. When I appeared on deck, the master said, "Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea."</p>

<p>On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a foreign accent. "Before I come on board  your vessel," said he, "will you have the kindness to inform me 
    whither you are bound?"</p>

<p>You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction, and to whom I should have supposed that my vessel 
    would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery 
    towards the northern pole.</p>

<p>Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied, and consented to come on board. Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who  thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been 
    boundless. His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted to carry him into 
    the cabin; but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air, he fainted. We accordingly brought him back to the deck, and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy, and forcing 
    him to swallow  a small quantity. As soon as he showed signs of life, we wrapped  him up in blankets, and placed him near the chimney of the  kitchen stove. By slow degrees he 
    recovered, and ate a little soup, which restored him wonderfully.</p>

<p>Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak; and I often feared that his suffering had deprived him of understanding. When he had in some measure recovered, 
    I removed him to my own cabin, and attended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness, 
    and even madness; but there are moments when, if any one performs an act of kindness towards him, or does him any the most trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, 
    as it were, with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he is generally melancholy and despairing; and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient 
    of the weight of woes that oppresses him.</p>

<p>When my guest was a little recovered, I had great trouble to keep off the  men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him  to be tormented by their
    idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose. Once, however, the lieutenant asked, Why he had come so far upon the ice 
    in so strange a vehicle?</p>

<p>His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest  gloom; and he replied, "To seek one who fled from me."</p>
<p>"And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Then I fancy we have seen him; for, the day before we picked you up, we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice."</p>

<p>This aroused the stranger's attention; and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, 
    he said,—"I have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as  well as that of these good people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries."</p>
<p>"Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine."</p>
<p>"And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have benevolently restored me to life."</p>

<p>Soon after this he inquired, if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge? I replied, that I could not answer with any degree of certainty; 
    for the ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but of this I could not judge.</p>

<p>From this time the a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck, to watch for the sledge which had 
    before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere. I  have promised that some one should watch for him, 
    and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight.</p>

<p>Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day. The stranger has gradually improved in health, but is very silent, and appears uneasy when any one 
    except myself enters his cabin. Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle, that the sailors are all interested in him, although they have had very little communication with him. 
    For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother; and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must have been a noble creature in his better days, 
    being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable.</p>

<p>I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before  his spirit had been broken by misery, I 
    should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart.</p>

<p>I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should I have any fresh incidents to record.</p>

<p>August 13th, 17--.</p>

<p>My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by misery 
    without feeling the most poignant grief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated; and when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, 
 yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.</p>

<p>He is now much recovered from his illness, and is continually on the deck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although unhappy, he is not so utterly 
    occupied by his own misery, but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without 
    disguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success, and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it. I was easily 
    led by the sympathy which he evinced, to use the language of my heart; to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul; and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, 
    how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise. One man's life or death were but a small price to pay for the 
    acquirement of the knowledge which I sought; for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my 
    listener's countenance. At first I perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes; and my voice quivered and failed me, as I beheld tears trickle 
    fast from between his fingers,—a groan burst from his heaving breast. I paused;—at length he spoke, in broken accents:—"Unhappy man! Do you share my madness? Have you drank also 
    of the intoxicating draught? Hear me,—let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!"</p>

<p>Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers, and many hours of repose 
    and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure.</p>

<p>Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again to
    converse concerning myself personally. He asked me the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told: but it awakened various trains of reflection. 
    I spoke of my desire of finding a friend—of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot; and expressed my conviction 
    that a man could boast of little happiness, who  did not enjoy this blessing.</p>

<p>"I agree with you," replied the stranger; "we are unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend 
    his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship. 
    You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for despair. But I—I have lost every thing, and cannot begin life anew."</p>

<p>As he said this, his countenance became expressive of a calm settled grief, that touched me to the heart. But he was silent, and presently retired to his cabin.</p>

<p>Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions, 
    seems still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery, and be overwhelmed by disappointments; 
    yet, when he has retired  into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit, that has a halo  around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.</p>

<p>Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine  wanderer? You would not, if you saw him. You have been tutored and  refined by books and retirement from the world, 
    and you are, therefore, somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful  man. Sometimes I have 
    endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he  possesses, that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I  ever knew. I believe it to be an intuitive discernment; 
    a quick but neverfailing power of judgment; a penetration into the causes of things,  unequalled for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression, 
    and a voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.</p>

<p>Yesterday the stranger said to me, "You may easily perceive, Captain Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had determined, at one time, that the memory of
    these evils should die with me; but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification of your
    wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been. I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same
    course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale; one that may direct you if you succeed in your
    undertaking, and console you in case of failure. Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous. Were we among the tamer scenes of nature, I might fear to encounter
    your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions, which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the
    ever-varied powers of nature:—nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed."</p>
    
   <p>You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered  communication; yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by a  recital of his misfortunes. 
       I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the  promised narrative, partly from curiosity, and partly from a strong  desire to ameliorate his fate, if it were in my power. 
       I expressed these  feelings in my answer.</p>
                
   <p>"I thank you," he replied, "for your sympathy, but it is useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I shall repose in peace. I understand your feeling," 
       continued he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; "but you are  mistaken, my friend, if thus you  will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny: listen to my 
       history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined."</p>
                
    <p>He then told me, that he would commence his narrative the next day when I  should be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have 
        resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to  record, as nearly as possible in  his own words, what he has related during the day. 
        If I should be engaged,  I will at least make notes. This manuscript will doubtless afford you the  greatest pleasure: but to me, who know him, and who hear it from his own lips, 
        with what interest and  sympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I commence my  task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on  me with 
        all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in animation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within. Strange and harrowing must be his story; 
        frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course, and wrecked it—thus!</p>

      <head>Chapter 1</head>
      
      <p>I AM by birth a Genevese; and my family is one of the
          most distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and
          syndics; and my father had filled several public
          situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who knew him, for his integrity and indefatigable
          attention to public business. He passed his younger
          days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; and a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying
          early, nor was it until the decline of life that he
          became a husband and the father of a family.</p>
          
          <p>As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from relating them. One of his most
              intimate friends was a merchant, who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty.
              This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition, and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for
              his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his
              daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest
              friendship, and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances. He bitterly deplored the
              false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time
              in endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and
              assistance.</p>
      
          <p>Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself; and it was ten months before my father discovered his
              abode. Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street, near the Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone
              welcomed him. Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes; but it was
              sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime he hoped to procure some
              respectable employment in a merchant's house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep
              and rankling, when he had leisure for reflection; and at length it took so fast hold of his mind, that at the end
              of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.</p>
      
          <p>His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness;
              but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing, and that there was no other prospect of
              support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould; and her courage rose to support her in her
              adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw; and by various means contrived to
              earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.</p>
      
          <p>Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time was more entirely occupied in attending him;
              her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her; and
              she knelt by Beaufort's coffin, weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber. He came like a protecting
              spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care, and after the interment of his friend he conducted her
              to Geneva, and placed her under the protection of a relation. Two years after this event Caroline became his
              wife.</p>
      
          <p>There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance seemed to unite them only
              closer in bonds of devoted affection. There was a sense
              of justice in my father's upright mind, which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love
              strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved, and so
              was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to
              my mother, differing wholly from the doating fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues,
              and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave
              inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her. Every thing was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. He
              strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered
              by the gardener, from every rougher wind, and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable
              emotion in her soft and benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit,
              had been shaken by what she had gone through. During the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my
              father had gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the
              change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for her weakened
              frame.</p>
      
          <p>From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born at Naples, and as an infant accompanied
              them in their rambles. I remained for several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each other,
              they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother's
              tender caresses, and my father's smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me, are my first recollections. I
              was their plaything and their idol, and something
              better—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by Heaven, whom to bring
              up to good, and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they
              fulfilled their duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they
              had given life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during
              every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord, that all seemed but
              one train of enjoyment to me.</p>
      
          <p>For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desire to have a daughter, but I continued their single
              offspring. When I was about five years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they passed a
              week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent disposition often made them enter
              the cottages of the poor. This, to my mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a
              passion,—remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been relieved,— for her to act in
              her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale
              attracted their notice, as being singularly disconsolate, while the number of half-clothed children gathered about
              it, spoke of penury in its worst shape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother,
              accompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and
              labour, distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes. Among these there was one which attracted my mother far
              above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others were dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this
              child was thin, and very fair. Her hair was the brightest living gold, and, despite the poverty of her clothing,
              seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her
              lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness, that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a
              being heaven-sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.</p>
      
          <p>The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this
              lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her
              mother was a German, and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with these good people to nurse:
              they were better off then. They had not been long married, and their eldest child was but just born. The father of
              their charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of Italy,—one among the
              schiavi ognor frementi, who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of its weakness. Whether he
              had died, or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria, was not known. His property was confiscated, his child
              became an orphan and a beggar. She continued with her foster parents, and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer than
              a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.</p>
      
          <p>When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa, a
              child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks, and whose form
              and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his permission my
              mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her
              presence had seemed a blessing to them; but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want, when
              Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They consulted their village priest, and the result was, that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my parents'
              house—my more than sister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and my
              pleasures.</p>
      
          <p>Every one loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became,
              while I shared it, my pride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had
              said playfully,—'I have a pretty present for my Victor—to-morrow he shall have it.' And when,
              on the morrow, she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness, interpreted her
              words literally, and looked upon Elizabeth as mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish. All praises bestowed on her, I received as made to a
              possession of my own. We called each other familiarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression could body
              forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more than sister, since till death she was to be
              mine only.</p>

   <div type="section">
       <head>Chapter 2</head>
       <p> We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in our ages. I need not say that we were
           strangers to any species of disunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our
           characters drew us nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense
           application, and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge. She busied herself with following the
           aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home—the sublime shapes of the mountains; the changes of
           the season; tempest and calm; the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of our Alpine
           summers,—she found ample scope for admiration and delight. While my companion contemplated with a
           serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their causes. The world was to me a
           secret which I desired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature, gladness akin to
           rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest sensations I can remember.</p>
           
           <p>On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave up entirely their wandering life, and fixed themselves in their native
               country. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a campagne  on Belrive, the eastern shore of the lake, at the
               distance of rather more than a league from the city.
               We resided principally in the latter, and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my
               temper to avoid a crowd, and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was indifferent, therefore, to my
               schoolfellows in general; but I united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship  to one among them. Henry Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He
               was a boy of singular talent and fancy. He loved
               enterprise, hardship, and even danger, for its own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He composed heroic songs, and
               began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays, and to enter into
               masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the
               heroes of Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood
               to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.</p>
       
           <p>No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My parents were possessed by the very spirit of
               kindness and indulgence. We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but
               the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families, I
               distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the development of filial
               love.</p>
       
           <p>My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in my temperature they were turned, not towards childish pursuits, but to an eager
               desire to learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages, nor the code of
               governments, nor the politics of various states, possessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of
               heaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things, or the inner spirit
               of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my enquiries were directed to the metaphysical,
               or, in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.</p>

       <item>
           <p>Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the
               moral relations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men, were his
               theme; and his hope and his dream was to become one among those whose names are recorded in story, as the gallant
               and adventurous benefactors of our species. The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in
               our peaceful home. Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of her celestial eyes, were
               ever there to bless and animate us. She was the living
               spirit of love to soften and attract: I might have become sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of
               my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. And Clerval—could
               aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?—yet he might not have been so perfectly humane, so
               thoughtful in his generosity—so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous
               exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence, and made the doing good the end and aim
               of his soaring ambition.</p>
       
           <p>I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind, and
               changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self.
               Besides, in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which led, by insensible steps to my
               after tale of misery: for when I would account to myself for the birth of that passion, which afterwards ruled my
               destiny, I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its
               course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.</p>
       
           <p>Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire therefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my predilection for that science. When I was thirteen years of age, we all
               went on a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon: the inclemency of the
               weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I chanced to find a volume of the works of
               Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate, and the wonderful facts which he relates, soon changed
               this feeling into enthusiasm. A new light seemed to dawn upon my mind; and, bounding with joy, I communicated my
               discovery to my father. My father looked carelessly at
               the title-page of my book, and said, "Ah! Cornelius Agrippa. My dear Victor, do not waste your time upon this; it
               is sad trash."</p>
       
           <p> If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me, that the principles of Agrippa had
               been entirely exploded, and that a modern system of
               science had been introduced, which possessed much greater powers than the ancient, because the powers of
               the latter were chimerical, while those of the
               former were real and practical; under such circumstances, I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside, and have
               contented my imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my former studies. It is even
               possible, that the train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse  that led to my ruin. But the cursory
               glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents; and I
               continued to read with the greatest avidity.</p>
       
           <p>When I returned home, my first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and afterwards of Paracelsus  and Albertus Magnus. I read and
               studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me treasures known to few beside myself;
               and I have described myself as always having been embued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature. In spite of the intense labour and
               wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied. Sir
               Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a
               child picking up shells  beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each
               branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted, appeared even to my boy's apprehensions, as tyros engaged
               in the same pursuit.</p>
       
           <p>The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him, and was acquainted with their
               practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little more. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but
               her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect, anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes in their
               secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments
               that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had repined.</p>
       
           <p> But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more. I took their word for all that
               they averred, and I became their disciple. It may
               appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century; but while I followed the routine of education in
               the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self taught with regard to my favourite studies. My father was
               not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a child's blindness, added to a student's thirst for knowledge.
               Under the guidance of my new preceptors, I entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life. But the
               latter soon obtained my undivided attention:
               wealth was an inferior object; but what glory would
               attend the discovery, if I could banish disease from the human frame, and render man invulnerable to any but a
               violent death!</p>
       
           <p>Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or
               devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfillment of which I most eagerly
               sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience
               and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And thus for a time I was occupied by exploded
               systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand contradictory theories, and floundering desperately in a very
               slough of multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning, till an accident again
               changed the current of my ideas.</p>
       
           <p> When I was about fifteen years old, we had retired to our house near Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunder-storm. It advanced from behind the
               mountains of Jura; and the thunder
               burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained, while the storm lasted,
               watching its progress with curiosity and delight. As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire
               issue from an old and beautiful oak, which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the dazzling
               light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next morning,
               we found the tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin
               ribands of wood. I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.</p>
       
           <p>Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity. On this occasion a man of great
               research in natural philosophy was with us, and, excited by this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a
               theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to
               me. All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of
               my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies. It
               seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew
               despicable. By one of those caprices of the mind, which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth, I at once
               gave up my former occupations; set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation;
               and entertained the greatest disdain for a would-be science, which could never even step within the threshold of
               real knowledge. In this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics, and the branches of study appertaining to that science, as being built upon secure
               foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.</p>
       
           <p> Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin. When I
               look back, it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion
               of the guardian angel of my life—the last
               effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars, and ready to
               envelope me. Her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul, which followed the
               relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies. It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil
               with their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.</p>
       
           <p>It was a strong effort of the spirit of good; but it was ineffectual. Destiny was too potent, and immutable laws
               had decreed my utter and terrible destruction.</p>

     <head>Chapter 3</head>
     <p> WHEN I had attained the age of seventeen, my parents resolved that I should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had hitherto attended
         the schools of Geneva; but my father thought it necessary, for the completion of my education, that I should be made acquainted with
         other customs than those of my native country. My departure was therefore fixed at an early date; but, before the
         day resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred—an omen, as it were, of my future misery.</p>
         
         <p>Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness
             was severe, and she was in the greatest danger. During her illness, many arguments had been urged to persuade my
             mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had, at first, yielded to our entreaties; but when she heard that
             the life of her favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She attended her sick
             bed,—her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper,—Elizabeth was
             saved, but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my mother sickened;
             her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated
             the worst event. On her death-bed the fortitude and
             benignity of this best of women did not desert her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself:—"My
             children," she said, "my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union. This
             expectation will now be the consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to my younger
             children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit
             you all? But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death, and will
             indulge a hope of meeting you in another world."</p>
     
         <p>She died calmly; and her countenance expressed affection even in death. I need not describe the feelings of those
             whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable evil; the void that presents itself to the soul; and the
             despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she, whom we saw every day, and whose very existence
             appeared a part of our own, can have departed for ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have
             been extinguished, and the sound of a voice so familiar, and dear to the ear, can be hushed, never more to be
             heard. These are the reflections of the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil,
             then the actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear
             connection? and why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at length arrives,
             when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be
             deemed a sacrilege, is not banished. My mother was
             dead, but we had still duties which we ought to
             perform; we must continue our course with the rest, and learn to think ourselves fortunate, whilst one remains
             whom the spoiler has not seized.</p>
     
         <p>My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, was now again determined upon. I obtained
             from my father a respite of some weeks. It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose, akin to death, of
             the house of mourning, and to rush into the thick of life. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me.
             I was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me; and, above all, I desired to see my sweet
             Elizabeth in some degree consoled.</p>
     
     
         <p>She indeed veiled her grief, and strove to act the comforter to us all. She looked steadily on life, and assumed its duties with courage and zeal. She
             devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and cousins. Never was she so enchanting as at
             this time, when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us. She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to
             make us forget.</p>
     
         <p>The day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval spent the last evening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade
             his father to permit him to accompany me, and to
             become my fellow student; but in vain. His father was a narrow-minded trader, and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations
             and ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education. He said
             little; but when he spoke, I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve,
             not to be chained to the miserable details of commerce.</p>
     
         <p>We sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other, nor persuade ourselves to say the word "Farewell!"
             It was said; and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the other was deceived: but
             when at morning's dawn I descended to the carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there—my
             father again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to renew her entreaties that I would
             write often, and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.</p>
     
         <p>I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away, and indulged in the most melancholy reflections. I, who
             had ever been surrounded by amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure, I was now alone. In the university, whither I was
             going, I must form my own friends, and be my own protector. My life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and
             domestic; and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and
             Clerval; these were "old familiar faces"; but I
             believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as I commenced my journey;
             but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I ardently
             desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home, thought it hard to remain during my youth
             cooped up in one place, and had longed to enter the world, and take my station among other human beings. Now my
             desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to repent.</p>
     
         <p>I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes. I
             alighted, and was conducted to my solitary apartment, to spend the evening as I pleased.</p>
     
         <p>The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction, and paid a visit to some of the principal professors.
             Chance—or rather the evil influence, the Angel
             of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my
             father's door—led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. He was an uncouth
             man, but deeply embued in the secrets of his science. He asked me several questions concerning my progress in the
             different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy. I replied carelessly; and, partly in contempt,
             mentioned the names of my alchymists as the principal authors I had studied. The professor stared: "Have you," he
             said, "really spent your time in studying such nonsense?"</p>
     
         <p>I replied in the affirmative. "Every minute," continued M. Krempe with warmth, "every instant that you have wasted
             on those books is utterly and entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless
             names. Good God! in what desert land have you lived, where no one was kind enough to inform you that these
             fancies, which you have so greedily imbibed, are a thousand years old, and as musty as they are ancient? I little
             expected in this enlightened and scientific age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear
             sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew."</p>
     
         <p>So saying, he stepped aside, and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural philosophy, which he
             desired me to procure; and dismissed me, after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended
             to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow-professor, would lecture upon
             chemistry the alternate days that he omitted.</p>
     
         <p>I returned home, not disappointed, for I have said that I had long considered those authors useless whom the
             professor reprobated; but I returned, not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape. M.
             Krempe was a little squat man, with a gruff voice
             and a repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits. In rather a
             too philosophical and connected a strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come to
             concerning them in my early years. As a child, I had not been content with the results promised by the modern
             professors of natural science. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth, and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the
             steps of knowledge along the paths of time, and exchanged the discoveries of recent enquirers for the dreams of
             forgotten alchymists. Besides, I had a contempt for the
             uses of modern natural philosophy. It was very different, when the masters of the science sought
             immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand: but now the scene was changed. The ambition of the
             inquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of
             those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of
             little worth.</p>
     
         <p>Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent
             in becoming acquainted with the localities, and the principal residents in my new abode. But as the ensuing week
             commenced, I thought of the information which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And although I could
             not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he
             had said of M. Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.</p>
     
         <p>Partly from curiosity, and partly from idleness, I went
             into the lecturing room, which M. Waldman entered
             shortly after. This professor was very unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an
             aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his
             head were nearly black. His person was short, but remarkably erect; and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.
             He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry, and the various improvements made by
             different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took
             a cursory view of the present state of the science, and explained many of its elementary terms. After having made
             a few preparatory experiments, he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall
             never forget:—</p>
     
         <p>"The ancient teachers of this science," said he, "promised impossibilities, and performed nothing. The modern
             masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot
             be transmuted, and that the elixir of life is a chimera. But these philosophers, whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and
             their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They
             penetrate into the recesses of nature, and show how she works in her hiding places. They ascend into the heavens: they have discovered how the
             blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe. They have acquired
             new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the
             invisible world with its own shadows."</p>
     
         <p>Such were the professor's words—rather let me say such the words of fate, enounced to destroy me. As he
             went on, I felt as if my soul were grappling with a
             palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being: chord
             after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception, one purpose. So much has
             been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein,—more, far more, will I achieve: treading in the steps
             already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of
             creation.</p>
     
         <p>I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I had no power to produce
             it. By degrees, after the morning's dawn, sleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight's thoughts were as a dream.
             There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies, and to devote myself to a science for which I
             believed myself to possess a natural talent. On the same day, I paid M. Waldman a visit. His manners in private
             were even more mild and attractive than in public; for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture,
             which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I gave him pretty nearly the same
             account of my former pursuits as I had given to his fellow-professor. He heard with attention the little narration
             concerning my studies, and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that
             M. Krempe had exhibited. He said, that "these were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were
             indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new
             names, arrange in connected classifications, the
             facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The labours of men of genius,
             however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind." I
             listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption or affectation; and then added, that his
             lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured terms, with the
             modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have
             made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours. I requested his advice concerning the
             books I ought to procure.</p>
     
         <p>"I am happy," said M. Waldman, "to have gained a disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no
             doubt of your success. Chemistry is that branch of
             natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account
             that I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time I have not neglected the other branches of science. A
             man would make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your wish
             is to become really a man of science, and not merely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to
             every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics."</p>
     
         <p>He then took me into his laboratory, and explained to me the uses of his various machines; instructing me as to
             what I ought to procure, and promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in the science
             not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of books which I had requested; and I took my leave.</p>
     
         <p>Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.</p>

      <head>Chapter 4</head>
      
      <p> FROM this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the most comprehensive sense of the term, became
          nearly my sole occupation. I read with ardour those
          works, so full of genius and discrimination, which modern inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the
          lectures, and cultivated the acquaintance, of the men of science of the university; and I found even in M. Krempe
          a great deal of sound sense and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy  and manners, but not on that account
          the less valuable. In M. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism; and his
          instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature, that banished every idea of pedantry. In a
          thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of
          knowledge, and made the most abstruse enquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application was at
          first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded, and soon became so ardent and eager, that the
          stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.</p>
         
          <p> As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress was rapid. My ardour  was indeed the astonishment of the students, and my proficiency
              that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me, with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on? whilst M.
              Waldman expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart and soul, 
              in the pursuit of some
              discoveries, which I hoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of
              science. In other studies you go as far as others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in
              a scientific pursuit there is continual food for
              discovery and wonder. A mind of moderate capacity, which closely pursues one study, must infallibly arrive
              at great proficiency in that study; and I, who continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit, and was
              solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly, that, at the end of two years, I made some discoveries in the
              improvement of some chemical instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the university. When I
              had arrived at this point, and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as
              depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my residence there being no longer conducive to my
              improvements, I thought of returning to my friends
              and my native town, when an incident happened that protracted my stay. </p>
      
          <p> One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any
              animal endued with life. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed? It was a bold question,
              and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming
              acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not
              restrain our inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind, and determined thenceforth to apply
              myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been
              animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been irksome, and almost
              intolerable. To examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. I became acquainted with the science of anatomy: but this was not sufficient; I
              must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body. In my education my father had taken the
              greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever remember to
              have trembled at a tale of superstition, or to have feared the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon
              my fancy; and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat
              of beauty and strength, had become food for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay, and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and 
              charnel houses. My attention was fixed
              upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the fine form of man  was degraded and wasted; I beheld
              the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye
              and brain. I paused, examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change from life
              to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a
              light so brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which
              it illustrated, I was surprised, that among so many men of genius, who had directed their inquiries towards the
              same science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret.</p>
      
          <p> Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman.
              The sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens, than that which I now affirm is true. Some miracle might
              have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable. After days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue, I
              succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.</p>
      
          <p>The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in painful labour,
              to arrive at once at the summit of my desires, was the
              most gratifying consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so great and overwhelming, that all the
              steps by which I had been progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result. What had been
              the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world was now within my grasp. Not that, like a
              magic scene, it all opened upon me at once: the
              information I had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them towards
              the object of my search, than to exhibit that object already accomplished. I was like the Arabian  who had been buried with the dead, and
              found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering, and seemingly ineffectual, light.</p>
      
          <p>I see by your eagerness, and the wonder and hope which
              your eyes express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with which I am acquainted; that cannot
              be: listen patiently until the end of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that subject.
              I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then
              was, to your destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my
              example, how dangerous is the acquirement of
              knowledge, and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires
              to become greater than his nature will allow.</p>
      
          <p> When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it. Although I
              possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its
              intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, still
              remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler 
              organization; but my imagination was too much exalted by my first
              success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man. The
              materials at present within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking; but I doubted not
              that I should ultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my operations might be
              incessantly baffled, and at last my work be imperfect: yet, when I considered the improvement which every day
              takes place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the
              foundations of future success. Nor could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its
              impracticability. It was with these feelings that I began the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the
              parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a
              gigantic stature; that is to say, about eight feet in
              height, and proportionably large. After having formed this determination, and having spent some months in
              successfully collecting and arranging my materials, I
              began.</p>
      
          <p> No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death appeared to me
              ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species
              would bless me as its creator and source; many happy
              and excellent natures would owe their being to me. No
              father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these reflections, I thought, that
              if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible)
              renew life where death had apparently devoted the
              body to corruption.</p>
      
          <p>These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with
              study, and my person had become emaciated with
              confinement. Sometimes, on the very brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the
              next day or the next hour might realise. One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated
              myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued
              nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil, as I dabbled among the unhallowed
              damps of the grave, or tortured the living animal to
              animate the lifeless clay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a resistless, and
              almost frantic, impulse, urged me forward; I seemed to
              have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was indeed but a passing trance, that only
              made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned to my
              old habits. I collected bones from charnel houses; and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of
              the human frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all the other apartments by a
              gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy creation: my eye-balls were
              starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The dissecting room  and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and
              often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which
              perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a conclusion.</p>
      
          <p> The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart
              and soul, in one pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a more plentiful
              harvest, or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage: but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature.
              And the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles
              absent, and whom I had not seen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them; and I well remembered the
              words of my father: "I know that while you are pleased with yourself, you will think of us with affection, and we
              shall hear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof
              that your other duties are equally neglected."</p>
      
          <p>I knew well therefore what would be my father's feelings; but I could not tear my thoughts from my employment,
              loathsome in itself, but which had taken an irresistible
              hold of my imagination. I wished, as it were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object, which swallowed up
              every habit of my nature, should be completed.</p>
      
          <p> I then thought that my father would be unjust if he
              ascribed my neglect to vice, or faultiness on my part; but I am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving
              that I should not be altogether free from blame. A
              human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind, and never to allow passion or a
              transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule.
              If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections, and to destroy your taste for
              those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say,
              not befitting the human mind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to
              interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic
              affections, Greece had not been enslaved; Cæsar would have spared his country; America would
              have been discovered more gradually; and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.</p>
      
          <p>But I forget that I am moralising in the most interesting
              part of my tale; and your looks remind me to proceed.</p>
      
          <p>My father made no reproach in his letters, and only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my occupations more
              particularly than before. Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not watch the
              blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before always yielded me supreme delight—so
              deeply was I engrossed in my occupation. The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a close;
              and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had succeeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared
              rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the
              mines, or any other unwholesome trade, than an artist occupied by his favourite employment. Every night I was
              oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a
              most painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow-creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed at the wreck I
              perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone sustained me: my labours would soon end, and I
              believed that exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself both of these,
              when my creation should be complete.</p>

<div type="section">
    <head>Chapter 5</head>
    <p>IT was on a dreary night of November, that I beheld
        the accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me,
        that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless
        thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my
        candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a
        convulsive motion agitated its limbs.</p>
        
        <p>How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe,
            or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite
            pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as
            beautiful. Beautiful!—Great God! His yellow
            skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his
            teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that
            seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and
            straight black lips.</p>
    
        <p>The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature. I had worked hard for nearly
            two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest
            and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far
            exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart.
            Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room, and continued a long time
            traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind
            to sleep. At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured; and I threw myself on the bed in my
            clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness. But it was in vain: I slept indeed, but I was
            disturbed by the wildest dreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets of
            Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her; but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became
            livid with the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud
            enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel. I started from my sleep with
            horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth
            chattered, and every limb became convulsed: when, by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way
            through the window-shutters, I beheld the wretch
            —the miserable monster whom I had created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if
            eyes they may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin
            wrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped, and rushed down stairs. I
            took refuge in the court-yard belonging to the house which I inhabited; where I remained during the rest of the
            night, walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if
            it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal
            corpse to which I had so miserably given life.</p>
    
        <p>Oh! no mortal could support the horror of that
            countenance. A mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I had gazed on him
            while unfinished; he was ugly then; but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a
            thing such as even Dante could not have conceived. </p>
    
        <p>I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly, that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at
            others, I nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with this horror, I felt the
            bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space, were now become a hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the
            overthrow so complete!</p>
    
        <p>Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned, and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt,
            its white steeple and clock, which indicated the
            sixth hour. The porter opened the gates of the court,
            which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought
            to avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my view. I did not dare return to
            the apartment which I inhabited, but felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain, which poured from
            a black and comfortless sky.</p>
    
        <p>I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring, by bodily exercise, to ease the load that weighed
            upon my mind. I traversed the streets, without any clear conception of where I was, or what I was doing. My heart
            palpitated in the sickness of fear; and I hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:—</p>
        <lg>
            <l>Like one who, on a lonely road,<lb/>
                <l>Doth walk in fear and dread,<lb/> 
                <l>And, having once turned round, walks on,<lb/> 
                <l>And turns no more his head;<lb/> 
                <l>Because he knows a frightful fiend<lb/>
                <l>Doth close behind him tread.*<lb/>
            </l>
        </lg>
        <p>Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various diligences and carriages usually
            stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why; but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me
            from the other end of the street. As it drew nearer, I observed that it was the Swiss diligence: it stopped just where I was standing;
            and, on the door being opened, I perceived Henry
            Clerval, who, on seeing me, instantly sprung out. "My dear Frankenstein," exclaimed he, "how glad I am to see
            you! how fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my alighting!"</p>
    </item>
    <item>
        <p>Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth,
            and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror and
            misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months, calm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend,
            therefore, in the most cordial manner, and we walked towards my college. Clerval continued talking for some time
            about our mutual friends, and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to Ingolstadt. "You may easily
            believe," said he, "how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not
            comprised in the noble art of book-keeping; and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his
            constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch schoolmaster in the Vicar of Wakefield:—'I have ten thousand
            florins a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.' But his affection for me at length overcame his
            dislike of learning, and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge."</p>
    
        <p>"It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left my father, brothers, and Elizabeth."</p>
    
        <p>"Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom. By the bye, I mean to lecture you a little upon their account
            myself.—But, my dear Frankenstein," continued he, stopping short, and gazing full in my face, "I did not
            before remark how very ill you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for several
            nights."</p>
    
        <p>"You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation, that I have not allowed myself
            sufficient rest, as you see: but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an end, and that
            I am at length free."</p>
    
        <p>I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to allude to the occurrences of the preceding
            night. I walked with a quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and the thought made me
            shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might still be there, alive, and walking about. I dreaded to behold this monster; but I feared still more that Henry
            should see him. Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs, I darted up
            towards my own room. My hand was already on the lock of the door before I recollected myself. I then paused; and a
            cold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them
            on the other side; but nothing appeared. I stepped fearfully in: the apartment was empty; and my bed-room was also
            freed from its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me; but when
            I became assured that my enemy had indeed fled, I
            clapped my hands for joy, and ran down to Clerval.</p>
    
        <p>We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; but I was unable to contain myself. It was
            not joy only that possessed me; I felt my flesh tingle with
            excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a single instant in the
            same place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud. Clerval at first attributed my unusual
            spirits to joy on his arrival; but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account;
            and my loud, unrestrained, heartless laughter,
            frightened and astonished him.</p>
    
        <p>"My dear Victor," cried he, "what, for God's sake, is the matter? Do not laugh in that manner. How ill you are!
            What is the cause of all this?"</p>
    
        <p>"Do not ask me," cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; "he can
            tell.—Oh, save me! save me!" I imagined that the monster seized me; I struggled furiously, and fell
            down in a fit.</p>
    
        <p>Poor Clerval! what must have been his feelings? A meeting, which he anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned
            to bitterness. But I was not the witness of his grief; for I was lifeless, and did not recover my senses for a long,
            long time.</p>
    
        <p>This was the commencement of a nervous fever, which
            confined me for several months. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I afterwards learned that,
            knowing my father's advanced age, and unfitness for so
            long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing
            the extent of my disorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive nurse than himself; and, firm
            in the hope he felt of my recovery, he did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest
            action that he could towards them.</p>
    
        <p>But I was in reality very ill; and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting attentions of my friend could
            have restored me to life. The form of the monster on
            whom I had bestowed existence was for ever before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my
            words surprised Henry: he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination; but the pertinacity with
            which I continually recurred to the same subject, persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some
            uncommon and terrible event.</p>
    
        <p>By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses, that alarmed and grieved my friend, I recovered. I remember the
            first time I became capable of observing outward
            objects with any kind of pleasure, I perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared, and that the young buds
            were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. It was a divine spring; and the season contributed
            greatly to my convalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom; my gloom disappeared,
            and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.</p>
    
        <p>"Dearest Clerval," exclaimed I, "how kind, how very good you are to me. This whole winter, instead of being spent
            in study, as you promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever repay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which
            I have been the occasion; but you will forgive me."</p>
    
        <p>"You will repay me entirely, if you do not discompose yourself, but get well as fast as you can; and since you
            appear in such good spirits, I may speak to you on one subject, may I not?"</p>
    
        <p>I trembled. One subject! what could it be? Could he allude to an object on whom I dared not even think?</p>
    
        <p>"Compose yourself," said Clerval, who observed my change of colour, "I will not mention it, if it agitates you; but
            your father and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own hand-writing. They
            hardly know how ill you have been, and are uneasy at your
            long silence."</p>
  
        <p>"Is that all, my dear Henry? How could you suppose that my
            first thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love, and who are so deserving of my
            love."</p>
    
        <p>"If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad to see a letter that has been lying here some
            days for you: it is from your cousin, I believe."<lb/>

            <p>CLERVAL then put the following letter into my hands. It was from my own Elizabeth:—</p>
            <p> "My dearest Cousin,</p>
                <p> "You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me
                    on your account. You are forbidden to write—to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor, is
                    necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long time I have thought that each post would bring this line, and my
                    persuasions have restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have prevented his encountering
                    the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey; yet how often have I regretted not being able to
                    perform it myself! I figure to myself that the task of attending on your sick bed has devolved on some mercenary
                    old nurse, who could never guess your wishes, nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor
                    cousin. Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeed you are getting better. I eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own
                    handwriting.</p>
            
                <p>"Get well—and return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful home, and friends who love you dearly. Your father's health is vigorous, and he asks but to
                    see you,—but to be assured that you are well; and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance.
                    How pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our Ernest! He is now sixteen, and full of activity and spirit. He is desirous to be a true Swiss, and to
                    enter into foreign service; but we cannot part with him, at least until his elder brother return to us. My uncle
                    is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country; but Ernest never had your powers of
                    application. He looks upon study as an odious fetter;—his time is spent in the open air, climbing hills
                    or rowing on the lake. I fear that he will become an idler, unless we yield the point, and permit him to enter on
                    the profession which he has selected.</p>
            
                <p>"Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken place since you left us. The blue lake, and
                    snow-clad mountains, they never change;—and I think our placid home, and our contented hearts are
                    regulated by the same immutable laws. My trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for
                    any exertions by seeing none but happy, kind faces around me. Since you left us, but one change has taken place in
                    our little household. Do you remember on what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family? Probably you do not; I
                    will relate her history, therefore, in a few words. Madame Moritz, her mother, was a widow with four children, of
                    whom Justine was the third. This girl had always been the favourite of her father; but, through a strange
                    perversity, her mother could not endure her, and,
                    after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observed this; and, when Justine was twelve years of
                    age, prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house. The republican institutions of our country have produced
                    simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is
                    less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the lower orders being neither so poor nor so
                    despised, their manners are more refined and moral. A
                    servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received
                    in our family, learned the duties of a servant; a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include the
                    idea of ignorance, and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.</p>
            
                <p>"Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I recollect you once remarked, that if you were in
                    an ill humour, one glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica she
                    looked so frank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great attachment for her, by which she was induced to give her an education superior to
                    that which she had at first intended. This benefit was fully repaid; Justine was the most grateful little creature
                    in the world: I do not mean that she made any professions, I never heard one pass her lips; but you could see by
                    her eyes that she almost adored her protectress. Although her disposition was gay, and in many respects
                    inconsiderate, yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. She thought her the model of all
                    excellence, and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.</p>
            
                <p>"When my dearest aunt died, every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor Justine, who had
                    attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection. Poor Justine was very ill; but other trials were
                    reserved for her.</p>
            
                <p>"One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. The conscience of the woman was
                    troubled; she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgment from heaven to chastise her
                    partiality. She was a Roman catholic; and I believe
                    her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few months after your departure for
                    Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her repentant mother. Poor girl! she wept when she quitted our house; she
                    was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners, which
                    had before been remarkable for vivacity. Nor was her residence at her mother's house of a nature to restore her
                    gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance. She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her
                    unkindness, but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister. Perpetual
                    fretting at length threw Madame Moritz into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is now
                    at peace forever. She died on the first approach of cold
                    weather, at the beginning of this last winter. Justine has returned to us; and I assure you I love her
                    tenderly. She is very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her expressions
                    continually remind me of my dear aunt.</p>
            
                <p>"I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling William. I wish you could see him; he is very tall
                    of his age, with sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eye-lashes, and curling hair. When he smiles, two little dimples
                    appear on each cheek, which are rosy with health. He has already had one or two little wives, but Louisa Biron is his favourite, a pretty little girl of
                    five years of age.</p>
            
                <p>"Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of Geneva. The
                    pretty Miss Mansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young
                    Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Your
                    favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of Clerval from Geneva.
                    But he has already recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a very lively pretty
                    Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. She is a widow, and much older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a
                    favourite with everybody.</p>
            
                <p>"I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety returns upon me as I conclude. Write,
                    dearest Victor, -- one line—one word will be a blessing to us. Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his
                    kindness, his affection, and his many letters: we are sincerely grateful. Adieu! my cousin; take care of yourself;
                    and, I entreat you, write!</p>
                <p>"ELIZABETH LAVENZA.</p>
                <p>"Geneva, March 18th, 17--."</p>
            
                <p>"Dear, dear Elizabeth!" I exclaimed, when I had read her letter, "I will write instantly, and relieve them from the
                    anxiety they must feel." I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence had commenced, and
                    proceeded regularly. In another fortnight I was able to leave my chamber.</p>
            
                <p>One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the several professors of the university. In
                    doing this, I underwent a kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained. Ever since the
                    fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even
                    to the name of natural philosophy. When I was
                    otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous
                    symptoms. Henry saw this, and had removed all my apparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment; for he
                    perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory. But these cares of
                    Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with
                    kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the
                    subject; but, not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty, and changed the subject from my
                    improvement to the science itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What could I do? He meant
                    to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments
                    which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I writhed under his words, yet dared not
                    exhibit the pain I felt. Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of
                    others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general
                    turn. I thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not
                    speak. I saw plainly that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and although
                    I loved him with a mixture of affection and
                    reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide to him that event which was so
                    often present to my recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.</p>
            
                <p>M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of almost insupportable sensitiveness, his
                    harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. "D--n the fellow!"
                    cried he; "why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript us all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless
                    true. A youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as in the gospel, has now set
                    himself at the head of the university; and if he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of
                    countenance.—Ay, ay," continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering, "M. Frankenstein is
                    modest; an excellent quality in a young man. Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I
                    was myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time."</p>
            
                <p>M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so
                    annoying to me.</p>
            
            <p>Clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his literary pursuits
                differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental
                languages, as thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue
                no inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise. The Persian,
                Arabic, and Sanscrit languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on the same studies. Idleness
                had ever been irksome to me, and now that I wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt great
                relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the
                orientalists. I did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for I did not contemplate making
                any other use of them than temporary amusement. I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well repaid my
                labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy elevating to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors
                of any other country. When you read their writings, life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses, in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy, and the fire
                that consumes your own heart. How different from the manly
                and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!</p>
            
                <p>Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being
                    delayed by several accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable, and my journey was retarded until the
                    ensuing spring. I felt this delay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved friends. My
                    return had only been delayed so long, from an unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become acquainted with any of its
                    inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came,
                    its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.</p>
            
                <p>The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure,
                    when Henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a personal farewell to the
                    country I had so long inhabited. I acceded with pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval
                    had always been my favourite companion in the rambles of this nature that I had taken among the scenes of my
                    native country.</p>
            
                <p>We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits had long been restored, and they gained
                    additional strength from the salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and the
                    conversation of my friend. Study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but Clerval called forth the
                    better feelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.
                    Excellent friend! how sincerely did you love me,
                    and endeavour to elevate my mind, until it was on a level with your own! A selfish pursuit had cramped and
                    narrowed me, until your gentleness and affection
                    warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had
                    no sorrow or care. When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations. A
                    serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy. The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were
                    already in bud. I was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me, notwithstanding
                    my endeavours to throw them off, with an invincible burden.</p>
            
                <p>Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he exerted himself to amuse me, while he
                    expressed the sensations that filled his soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing:
                    his conversation was full of imagination; and very
                    often, in imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion. At other
                    times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew me out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.</p>
            
                <p>We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and
                    happy. My own spirits were high, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.</p></div>

                <head>Chapter 7</head>
                <p>ON my return, I found the following letter from my father—</p>
                <p> "My dear Victor,</p>
                <p> "You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us; and I was at first
                    tempted to write only a few lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. But that would be a
                    cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad
                    welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune? Absence
                    cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent son? I wish to prepare you for the
                    woeful news, but I know it is impossible; even now your eye skims over the page, to seek the words which are to
                    convey to you the horrible tidings.</p>
                    
                    <p>"William is dead!—that sweet child, whose
                        smiles delighted and warmed my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murdered!</p>
                
                    <p>"I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction.</p>
                
                    <p>"Last Thursday (May 7th) I, my niece, and your two
                        brothers, went to walk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged our walk farther than
                        usual. It was already dusk before we thought of returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had
                        gone on before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until they should return. Presently Ernest came, and inquired if we had seen his
                        brother: he said, he had been playing with him, that William had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly
                        sought for him, and afterwards waited for him a long time, but that he did not return.</p>
                
                    <p>"This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured
                        that he might have returned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with torches; for I could not rest,
                        when I thought that my sweet boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night; Elizabeth
                        also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had
                        seen blooming and active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless: the print of the murderer's
                        finger was on his neck.</p>
                
                    <p>"He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was
                        very earnest to see the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her; but she persisted, and entering the room
                        where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, 'O God! I have murdered
                        my darling child!'</p>
                
                    <p>"She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again lived, it was only to weep and sigh. She
                        told me, that that same evening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she
                        possessed of your mother. This picture is gone, and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the
                        deed. We have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him are unremitted; but they will not
                        restore my beloved William!</p>
                
                    <p>"Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the
                        cause of his death; her words pierce my heart. We are all unhappy; but will not that be an additional motive for
                        you, my son, to return and be our comforter? Your dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live
                        to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!</p>
                
                    <p>"Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin, but with feelings of peace and gentleness,
                        that will heal, instead of festering, the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my friend, but with
                        kindness and affection for those who love you, and not
                        with hatred for your enemies.</p>
                    <p> "Your affectionate and afflicted father,</p>
                    <p> ALPHONSE FRANKENSTEIN.</p>
                    <p> "Geneva, May 12th, 17--."</p>
                
                    <p>Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was surprised to observe the despair that succeeded
                        to the joy I at first expressed on receiving news from my friends. I threw the letter on the table, and covered my
                        face with my hands.</p>
                
                    <p>"My dear Frankenstein," exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me weep with bitterness, "are you always to be unhappy?
                        My dear friend, what has happened?"</p>
                
                    <p>I motioned to him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the room in the extremest agitation. Tears also
                        gushed from the eyes of Clerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.</p>
                
                    <p>"I can offer you no consolation, my friend," said he; "your disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do?"</p>
                
                    <p>"To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses."</p>
                
                    <p>During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation; he could only express his heartfelt sympathy. "Poor William!" said he, "dear lovely
                        child, he now sleeps with his angel mother! Who that
                        had seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his untimely loss! To die so miserably; to
                        feel the murderer's grasp! How much more a murderer, that could destroy such radiance innocence! Poor little
                        fellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but he is at rest. The pang is over, his
                        sufferings are at an end for ever. A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer be a
                        subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable survivors."</p>
                
                    <p>Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed themselves on my mind, and I remembered
                        them afterwards in solitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a cabriole, and bade farewell to my friend.</p>
                
                    <p>My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed to console and sympathise with my loved
                        and sorrowing friends; but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustain the
                        multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not
                        seen for nearly six years. How altered every thing might be during that time? One sudden and desolating change had
                        taken place; but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although
                        they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I dared not advance, dreading a thousand nameless
                        evils that made me tremble, although I was unable to define them.</p>
                
                    <p>I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I contemplated the lake: the waters were placid;
                        all around was calm; and the snowy mountains, "the
                        palaces of nature," were not changed. By degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued
                        my journey towards Geneva.</p>
                
                    <p>The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I approached my native town. I discovered more
                        distinctly the black sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc; I wept like a child.
                        "Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your wanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake
                        are blue and placid. Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?"</p>
                
                    <p>I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by
                        dwelling on these preliminary circumstances; but they
                        were days of comparative happiness, and I think of them with pleasure. My country, my beloved country! who but a
                        native can tell the delight I took in again beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely
                        lake!</p>
                
                    <p>Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also closed around; and when I could hardly see
                        the dark mountains, I felt still more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I foresaw
                        obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed
                        only in one single circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth
                        part of the anguish I was destined to endure.</p>
                
                    <p>It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates of the town were already shut; and I was
                        obliged to pass the night at Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. The sky was
                        serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor William had been murdered. As I
                        could not pass through the town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais. During this
                        short voyage I saw the lightnings playing on the
                        summit of Mont Blanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach rapidly; and, on landing, I
                        ascended a low hill, that I might observe its progress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the
                        rain coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.</p>
                
                    <p>I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head. It was echoed
                        from Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps of Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating
                        the lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant everything seemed of a pitchy darkness,
                        until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in Switzerland, appeared
                        at once in various parts of the heavens. The most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over that part of
                        the lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of Copêt.
                        Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the
                        Môle, a peaked mountain to the east of the lake.</p>
                
                    <p>While I watched the tempest so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with a hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped
                        my hands, and exclaimed aloud, "William, dear angel! this is thy funeral, this thy dirge!" As I said these words,
                        I perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood fixed, gazing
                        intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly
                        to me; its gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect, more hideous than belongs to humanity, instantly
                        informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy
                        dæmon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I shuddered at the conception)
                        the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my
                        teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it
                        in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could have destroyed that fair child. He was the murderer! I could not
                        doubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for
                        another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais
                        on the south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.</p>
                
                    <p>I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued, and the scene was enveloped in an
                        impenetrable darkness. I revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget: the whole train of
                        my progress towards the creation; the appearance of the work of my own hands alive at my bedside; its departure.
                        Two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and was this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the world a 
                        depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and
                        misery; had he not murdered my brother?</p>
                
                    <p>No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the
                        open air. But I did not feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair. I
                        considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of
                        horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me.</p>
                
                    <p>Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were open, and I hastened to my father's house. My
                        first thought was to discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made. But I paused when
                        I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at
                        midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at
                        the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly
                        improbable. I well knew that if any other had
                        communicated such a relation to me, I should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the
                        strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my relatives
                        to commence it. And then of what use would be pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the
                        overhanging sides of Mont Salêve? These reflections determined me, and I resolved to remain silent.</p>
                
                    <p>It was about five in the morning when I entered my father's house. I told the servants not to disturb the family,
                        and went into the library to attend their usual hour
                        of rising.</p>
                
                    <p>Six years had elapsed, passed as a dream but for one indelible trace, and I stood in the same place where I had
                        last embraced my father before my departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained to me. I gazed
                        on the picture of my mother, which stood over the mantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my
                        father's desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb
                        was rustic, and her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the sentiment of
                        pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my tears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus
                        engaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me. He expressed a sorrowful delight to
                        see me: "Welcome, my dearest Victor," said he. "Ah! I wish you had come three months ago, and then you would have
                        found us all joyous and delighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can alleviate; yet your
                        presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce
                        poor Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—Poor William! he was our darling and
                        our pride!"</p>
                
                    <p>Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother's eyes; a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame. Before, I had only
                        imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and a not less terrible, disaster. I tried
                        to calm Ernest; I enquired more minutely concerning
                        my father, and her I named cousin.</p>
                
                    <p>"She most of all," said Ernest, "requires consolation; she accused herself of having caused the death of my
                        brother, and that made her very wretched. But since the murderer has been discovered--"</p>
                
                    <p>"The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be?
                        who could attempt to pursue him? it is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the winds, or confine a
                        mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he was free last night!"</p>
                
                    <p>"I do not know what you mean; replied my brother, in accents of wonder, "but to us the discovery we have made
                        completes our misery. No one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be convinced,
                        notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of
                        all the family, could suddenly become capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?"</p>
                
                    <p>"Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes
                        it, surely, Ernest?"</p>
                
                    <p>"No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have almost forced conviction upon us: and her own
                        behaviour has been so confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear, leaves no hope for
                        doubt. But she will be tried to-day, and you will then hear all."</p>
                
                    <p>He related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William had been discovered, Justine had been taken ill,
                        and confined to her bed; for several days. During this interval, one of the servants, happening to examine the
                        apparel she had worn on the night of the murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which had
                        been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. The servant instantly showed it to one of the others, who,
                        without saying a word to any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition, Justine was
                        apprehended. On being charged with the fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her
                        extreme confusion of manner.</p>
                
                    <p>This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied earnestly, "You are
                        all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor, good Justine, is innocent."</p>
                
                    <p>At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his countenance, but he endeavoured to
                        welcome me cheerfully; and, after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced some other topic
                        than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed, "Good God, papa! Victor says that he knows who was the
                        murderer of poor William."</p>
                
                    <p>"We do also, unfortunately," replied my father; "for indeed I had rather have been for ever ignorant than have
                        discovered so much depravity and ingratitude in one I
                        valued so highly."</p>
                
                    <p>"My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent."</p>
                
                    <p>"If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be tried to-day, and I hope, I sincerely hope,
                        that she will be acquitted."</p>
                
                    <p>This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I
                        had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict her. My
                        tale was not one to announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as madness by the vulgar. Did
                        any one indeed exist, except I, the creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the existence
                        of the living monument of presumption and rash
                        ignorance which I had let loose upon the world?</p>
                
                    <p>We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I last beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness
                        surpassing the beauty of her childish years. There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and
                        intellect. She welcomed me with the greatest affection. "Your arrival, my dear cousin," said she, "fills me with
                        hope. You perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she be
                        convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do upon my own. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us;
                        we have not only lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely love, is to be torn away by
                        even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I never shall know joy more. But she will not, I am sure she will not; and
                        then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little William."</p>
                
                    <p>"She is innocent, my Elizabeth," said I, "and that shall be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered
                        by the assurance of her acquittal."</p>
                
                    <p>"How kind and generous you are! every one else believes
                        in her guilt, and that made me wretched; for I knew that it was impossible: and to see every one else
                        prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing." She wept.</p>
                
                    <p>"Dearest niece," said my father, "dry your tears. If she is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the activity with which I
                        shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality."</p>

                <head>Chapter 8</head>
                <p>WE passed a few sad hours, until eleven o'clock, when the trial was to commence.
 My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses, I
 accompanied them to the court. During the whole of this wretched mockery
 of justice  I suffered living torture. It
 was to be decided, whether the result of my curiosity  and lawless
 devices  would cause the death of two of my fellow-beings: one a smiling
 babe, full of innocence and joy; the other far more dreadfully murdered, with
 every aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.
 Justine also was a girl of merit, andpossessed qualities which promised to render
 her life happy: now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave; and I
 the cause!  A thousand times rather would I have confessed myself guilty
 of the crime ascribed to Justine; but I was absent when it was committed, and
 such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings
 of a madman, and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me.</p>

<p>The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning; and her countenance,
     always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her feelings, exquisitely
     beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in innocence, and did not tremble, although gazed
       on and execrated  by thousands; for all the kindness which her beauty
       might otherwise have excited, was obliterated in the minds of the spectators
       by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She
       was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her
       confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up
       her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the court, she threw
       her eyes round it, and quickly discovered where we were seated. A tear seemed
       to dim her eye when she saw us; but she quickly recovered herself, and a
       look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness.</p>

<p>The trial began; and, after the advocate against her had stated the
          charge, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined
          against her, which might have staggered any one who had not such
          proof  of her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of
          the night on which the murder had been committed, and towards morning
          had been perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the
          body of the murdered child had been afterwards found. The woman asked
          her what she did there; but she looked very strangely, and only returned
          a confused
          and unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight
          o'clock; and, when one inquired where she had passed the night,
          she replied, that she had been looking for the child, and demanded
          earnestly if any thing had been heard concerning him. When shown the
          body, she fell into violent hysterics, and kept her bed for several
          days. The picture was then produced, which the servant had found in
          her pocket; and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it
          was the same which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had
          placed round his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the
          court.</p>

<p>Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded,
          her countenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly
          expressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears; but, when she was
          desired to plead, she collected her powers, and spoke in an audible,
          although variable voice.</p>

<p>"God knows," she said, "how entirely I am innocent. But I do not
          pretend that my protestations should acquit me: I rest my innocence
          on a plain
          and simple explanation of the facts  which have been adduced against
          me; and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my judges
          to a favourable interpretation, where any circumstance appears doubtful
          or suspicious."</p>

<p>She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed
          the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at
          the house of an aunt at Chêne, a village situated at about a league  from
          Geneva. On her return, at about nine o'clock, she met a man, who asked
          her if she had seen any thing of the child who was lost. She was alarmed
          by this account, and passed several hours in looking for him, when
          the gates
          of Geneva  were shut, and she was forced to remain several hours
          of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call
          up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known. Most of the night she
          spent here watching; towards morning she believed that she slept for
          a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke. It was dawn,
          and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour to find
          my brother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay, it was
          without her knowledge. That she had been bewildered when questioned
          by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed a sleepless
          night, and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain. Concerning the
          picture she could give no account.</p>

<p>"I know," continued the unhappy victim, "how heavily and fatally
          this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of explaining
          it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left to
          conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been
          placed in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I
          have no enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked
          as to destroy me wantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know
          of no opportunity afforded him  for
          so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the jewel, to
          part with it again so soon?</p>

<p>"I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room
          for hope. I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning
          my character; and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed
          guilt, I must be condemned, although I
          would pledge my salvation  on my innocence."</p>

<p>Several witnesses were called, who had known her for many years,
          and they spoke well of her; but fear, and hatred of the crime of which
          they supposed her guilty, rendered them timorous, and unwilling to
          come forward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent
          dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,
          when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address
          the court. </p>

<p>"I am," said she, "the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered,
          or rather his sister, for I was educated by, and have lived with his
          parents ever since and even long before, his birth. It may therefore
          be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion; but when
          I see a fellow-creature about to perish through the cowardice of her
          pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what
          I know of her character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have
          lived in the same house with her, at
          one time for five, and at another for nearly two years. During
          all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent
          of human creatures. She
          nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last illness, with
          the greatest affection and care; and afterwards attended her own mother
          during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited the admiration of
          all who knew her; after which she again lived in my uncle's house,
          where she was beloved by all the family. She was warmly attached to
          the child who is now dead, and acted towards him like a most affectionate
          mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say, that, notwithstanding
          all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect
          innocence. She had no temptation for such an action: as to the bauble  on
          which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it, I should
          have willingly given it to her; so much do I esteem and value her." </p>

<p>A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth's simple and powerful appeal;
      but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in favor of poor
      Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence,
      charging her with the blackest
      ingratitude. She herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not
      answer. My own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial.
      I believed in her innocence; I knew it. Could the dæmon,
      who had (I did not for a minute doubt) murdered my brother, also in his
      hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy? I could
      not sustain the horror of my situation; and when I perceived that the popular
      voice, and the countenances of the judges, had already condemned my unhappy
      victim, I rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures
      of the accused  did not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence,
      but the fangs
      of remorse  tore my bosom, and would not forego their hold.</p>

<p>I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to
      the court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal question;
      but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my visit. The ballots  had
      been thrown; they were all black, and Justine was condemned.</p>

<p>I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before experienced
      sensations of horror; and I
      have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions, but words
      cannot convey an idea of the heart-sickening despair that I then endured.
      The person to whom I addressed myself added, that Justine had already confessed
      her guilt. "That evidence," he observed, "was hardly required in so
      glaring a case, but I am glad of it; and, indeed, none of our judges like
    to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so decisive."</p>

<p>This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? Had
      my eyes deceived me? and was I really as mad as the whole world would believe
      me to be, if I disclosed the object of my suspicions? I hastened to return
      home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.</p>

<p>"My cousin," replied I, "it is decided as you may have expected; all
        judges  had rather that ten innocent should suffer, than that one
        guilty should escape. But she has confessed."</p>

<p>This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness
      upon Justine's innocence. "Alas!" said she, "how shall I ever again believe
      in human
      goodness? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my sister, how could
      she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray? Her mild eyes seemed
      incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has committed a murder."</p>

<p>Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see
      my cousin. My
      father wished her not to go; but said, that he left it to her own
      judgment and feelings to decide. "Yes," said Elizabeth, "I will go, although
      she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany me: I cannot go alone." The
      idea of this visit was torture to me, yet I could not refuse.</p>

<p>We entered the gloomy prison-chamber, and beheld Justine sitting on some
      straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested
      on her knees. She rose on seeing us enter; and when we were left alone
      with her, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly.
      My cousin wept also.</p>

<p>"Oh, Justine!" said she, "why did you rob me of my last consolation?
      I relied on your innocence; and although I was then very wretched, I was
    not so miserable as I am now."</p>

<p>"And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also join
        with my enemies  to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?" Her voice
        was suffocated with sobs.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Rise, my poor girl," said Elizabeth, "why do you kneel, if you are innocent?
      I am not one of your enemies; I believed you guiltless, notwithstanding
      every evidence, until I heard that you had yourself declared your guilt.
      That report, you say, is false; and be assured, dear Justine, that nothing
      can shake my confidence in you for a moment, but your own confession." </p>

<p>"I did confess; but I confessed a lie. I
        confessed, that I might obtain absolution; but now that falsehood
        lies heavier at my heart than all my other sins. The God of heaven forgive
        me! Ever since I was condemned, my
        confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced, until I almost
        began to think that I
        was the monster  that he said I was. He threatened excommunication
        and hell fire in my last moments, if I continued obdurate. Dear lady,
        I had none to support me; all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy
        and perdition. What could I do? In an evil hour I
        subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly miserable."</p>

<p>She paused, weeping, and then continued—"I thought with horror, my
      sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed aunt
      had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable of a
      crime which none
      but the devil  himself could have perpetrated. Dear William! dearest
      blessed child! I soon shall see you again in heaven, where we shall all
    be happy; and that consoles me, going as I am to suffer ignominy and death."</p>

<p>"Oh, Justine! forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you. Why
      did you confess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not fear. I will proclaim,
      I will prove your innocence. I will melt the stony hearts of your enemies
      by my tears and prayers. You shall not die!—You, my play-fellow, my
      companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold! No! no! I never could survive
      so horrible a misfortune."</p>
    
<p>Justine shook her head mournfully. "I do not fear to die," she said; "that
      pang is past. God
      raises my weakness, and gives me courage to endure the worst. I leave
      a sad and bitter world; and if you remember me, and think of me as of one
      unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the fate awaiting me. Learn from me,
    dear lady, to submit in patience to the will of Heaven!"</p>

<p>During this conversation I
        had retired to a corner of the prison-room, where I could conceal
        the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair! Who dared talked of that?
        The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between
        life and death, felt
        not as I did, such deep and bitter agony. I
        gnashed my teeth, and ground them together, uttering a groan that
        came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When she saw who it was, she
        approached me, and said, "Dear sir, you are very kind to visit me; you,
        I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?"</p>

<p>I could not answer. "No, Justine," said Elizabeth; "he is more convinced
      of your innocence than I was; for even when he heard that you had confessed,
      he did not credit it."</p>

<p>"I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude
      towards those who think of me with kindness. How
      sweet is the affection of others  to such a
      wretch  as I am! It removes more than half my misfortune; and I feel
      as if I could die in peace, now that my innocence is acknowledged by you,
      dear lady, and your cousin."</p>

<p>Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed
      gained the resignation she desired. But I,
      the true murderer, felt the
      never-dying worm  alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or consolation.
      Elizabeth also wept, and was unhappy; but hers also was the misery of innocence,
      which, like a cloud that passes over the fair moon, for a while hides but
      cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and despair had penetrated into
      the core of my heart; I
      bore a hell within me, which nothing could extinguish. We stayed several
      hours with Justine; and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could
      tear herself away. "I wish," cried she, "that I were to die with you; I
      cannot live in this world of misery."</p>

<p>Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed
      her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth, and said, in a voice of half-suppressed
      emotion, "Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my
      beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and preserve
      you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer. Live, and
      be happy, and make
      others so."</p>

<p>And on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeth's heart-rending
        eloquence  failed to move the judges from their settled conviction
        in the criminality of the saintly sufferer. My passionate and indignant
        appeals were lost upon them. And when I received their cold answers,
        and heard the harsh unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed avowal
        died away on my lips. Thus I might proclaim myself a madman, but not
        revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim. She perished on the
        scaffold as a murderess!</p>

<p>From the tortures of my own heart, I turned
        to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also
        was my doing! And my father's woe, and the desolation of that late so
        smiling home—all was the work of my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep,
        unhappy ones; but these are not your last tears! Again shall you raise
        the funeral wail, and the sound of your lamentations shall again and
        again be heard! Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved
        friend; he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes—who
        has no thought nor sense of joy, except as it is mirrored also in your
        dear countenances—who would fill the air with blessings, and
        spend his life in serving you—he bids you weep—to shed countless
        tears; happy beyond his hopes, if thus inexorable
      fate  be satisfied, and if the destruction pause before the peace of
      the grave have succeeded to your sad torments! </p>

<p>Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn
        by remorse, horror, and despair, I beheld those l loved spend vain
        sorrow upon the graves of William and Justine, the first hapless victims
        to my unhallowed arts.</p>

     <head>Chapter 9</head>
     <p>NOTHING is more painful to the human mind, than, after the feelings have been worked up by a quick
         succession of events, the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows, and deprives the soul both of
         hope and fear. Justine died; she rested; and I was alive. The blood flowed freely in my veins, but a weight of
         despair and remorse pressed on my heart, which nothing could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of
         mischief beyond description horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself), was yet behind. Yet my heart
         overflowed with kindness, and the love of virtue. I had begun life with benevolent intentions, and thirsted for the moment
         when I should put them in practice, and make myself
         useful to my fellow-beings. Now all was
         blasted: instead of that serenity of conscience, which allowed me to look back upon the past with
         self-satisfaction, and from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell
         of intense tortures, such as no language can describe.</p>
         
         <p>This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never entirely recovered from the first shock it had
             sustained. I shunned the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only
             consolation—deep, dark, deathlike
             solitude.</p>
     
         <p>My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habits, and endeavoured by arguments
             deduced from the feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life, to inspire me with fortitude, and awaken in
             me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me. "Do you think, Victor," said he, "that I do not
             suffer also? No one could love a child more than I
             loved your brother;" (tears came into his eyes as he spoke); "but is it not a duty to the survivors, that we
             should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty owed to yourself; for excessive sorrow prevents
             improvement or enjoyment, or even the discharge of daily
             usefulness, without which no man is fit for society."</p>
     
         <p>This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I should have been the first to hide my grief, and
             console my friends, if remorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm with my other sensations. Now
             I could only answer my father with a look of despair, and endeavour to hide myself from his view.</p>
     
         <p>About this time we retired to our house at
             Belrive. This change was particularly agreeable to me. The shutting of the gates regularly at ten o'clock,
             and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour, had rendered our residence within the walls of
             Geneva very irksome to me. I was now free. Often, after the rest of the family had retired for the night, I took
             the boat, and passed many hours upon the water.
             Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake,
             I left the boat to pursue its own course, and gave way to my own miserable reflections. I was often tempted, when
             all was at peace around me, and I the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and
             heavenly—if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when I
             approached the shore—often, I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters might close over me and my calamities for ever.
             But I was restrained, when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly loved, and whose
             existence was bound up in mine. I thought also of my father, and surviving brother: should I by my base desertion
             leave them exposed and unprotected to the malice of the
             fiend whom I had let loose among them?</p>
     
         <p>At these moments I wept bitterly, and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that I might afford them
             consolation and happiness. But that could not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the
             author of unalterable evils; and I lived in daily fear, lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate
             some new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling that all was not over, and that he would still commit some signal
             crime, which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past. There was always scope for fear,
             so long as any thing I loved remained behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of
             him, I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed,
             and I ardently wished to extinguish that life which I
             had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation. I would have made a
             pilgrimage to the highest peak of the Andes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base. I wished to
             see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head, and avenge the deaths of William
             and Justine </p>
     
         <p>Our house was the house of mourning. My father's health was deeply shaken by the horror of the
             recent events. Elizabeth was sad and desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all
             pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she
             should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature, who in earlier youth
             wandered with me on the banks of the lake, and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects. The first of those
             sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth, had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest
             smiles.</p>
     
         <p>"When I reflect, my dear cousin," said she, "on the miserable death of Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world
             and its works as they before appeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice, that I read
             in books or heard from others, as tales of ancient days, or imaginary evils; at least they were remote, and more
             familiar to reason than to the imagination; but now
             misery has come home, and men appear to me as monsters
             thirsting for each other's blood. Yet I am certainly unjust. Every body believed that poor girl to be
             guilty; and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly she would have been the most
             depraved of human creatures. For the sake of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend,
             a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if it had been her own! I could not consent to the death of any human
             being; but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men. But she was
             innocent. I know, I feel she was innocent; you are of
             the same opinion, and that confirms me. Alas! Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness? I feel if I
             were walking on the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding, and endeavouring to plunge me into
             the abyss. William and Justine were assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free, and
             perhaps respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change
             places with such a wretch."</p>
     
         <p>I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed, but in effect, was the true
             murderer. Elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance, and kindly taking my hand said, "My dearest friend, you
             must calm yourself. These events have affected me, God knows how deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are.
             There is an expression of despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance, that makes me tremble. Dear Victor, banish these dark passions. Remember
             the friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you. Have we lost the power of rendering you happy? Ah!
             while we love—while we are true to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native
             country, we may reap every tranquil blessing,—what can disturb our peace?"</p>
     
         <p>And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every other gift of fortune, suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart? Even as she spoke I
             drew near to her, as if in terror; lest at that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her. Thus not
             the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of heaven, could redeem my soul from woe: the very
             accents of love were ineffectual. I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate. The
             wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced
             it, and to die—was but a type of me.</p>
     
         <p>Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me: but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul
             drove me to seek, by bodily exercise and hy change of place, some relief from my intolerable sensations. It was
             during an access of this kind that I suddenly left my
             home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought in the magnificence, the eternity of
             such scenes, to forget myself and my ephemeral, because human, sorrows. My wanderings were directed towards the valley of Chamounix. I had visited it frequently
             during my boyhood. Six years had passed since then: I was a wreck—but nought had changed in those
             savage and enduring scenes.</p>
     
         <p>I performed the first part of my journey on horseback. I afterwards hired a mule, as the more
             sure-footed, and least liable to receive injury on these rugged roads. The weather was fine: it was about the
             middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of Justine; that miserable epoch from which I
             dated all my woe. The weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in the ravine of Arve. The immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on
             every side—the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and the dashing of the waterfalls around,
             spoke of a power mighty as Omnipotence—and
             I ceased to fear, or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements,
             here displayed in their most terrific guise. Still, as I ascended higher, the valley assumed a more magnificent
             and astonishing character. Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains; the impetuous Arve, and
             cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees, formed a scene of singular beauty. But it was
             augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all,
             as belonging to another earth, the habitations
             of another race of beings.</p>
     
         <p>I passed the bridge of Pelissier, where the ravine, which the river forms, opened before me, and I began to ascend
             the mountain that overhangs it. Soon after I entered the valley of Chamounix. This valley is more wonderful and
             sublime, but not so beautiful and picturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed. The high and
             snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries; but I saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields. Immense
             glaciers approached the road; I heard the rumbling
             thunder of the falling avalanche, and marked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme and magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself
             from the surrounding aiguilles, and its tremendous dôme overlooked the valley.</p>
     
         <p>A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this journey. Some turn in the
             road, some new object suddenly perceived and recognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the
             light-hearted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds whispered in soothing accents, and maternal nature bade me weep no
             more. Then again the kindly influence ceased to act—I found myself fettered again to grief, and
             indulging in all the misery of reflection. Then I spurred on my animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears,
             and, more than all, myself—or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted, and threw myself on the grass,
             weighed down by horror and despair.</p>
     
         <p>At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion succeeded to the extreme fatigue both of body and of
             mind which I had endured. For a short space of time I remained at the window, watching the pallid lightnings that
             played above Mont Blanc, and listening to the rushing of the Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath. The same
             lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations: when I placed my head upon my pillow, sleep crept
             over me; I felt it as it came, and blest the giver of oblivion.</p>

 <div type="section">
     <head>Chapter 10</head>
     <p>I SPENT the following day roaming through the valley. I stood beside the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that with slow pace is advancing down 
         from the summit of the hills, to barricade the valley. The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were
         scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious presence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling waves, or the fall of some vast fragment,
         the thunder sound of the avalanche, or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws, was ever and 
         anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in their hands. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. 
         They elevated me from all littleness of feeling; and although they did not remove my grief, they subdued and tranquillized it. In some degree, also, they diverted my mind
         from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were, waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes
         which I had contemplated during the day. They congregated round me; the unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods, and ragged bare ravine the eagle,
         soaring amidst the cloud—they all gathered round me, and bade me be at peace.</p>

<p>Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke? All of
soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded
every thought. The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists
hid the summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the
faces of those mighty friends. Still I would penetrate their
misty veil, and seek them in their cloudy retreats. What were
rain and storm to me? My mule was brought to the door, and I
resolved to ascend to the
summit of Montanvert. I remembered the effect that the view
of the tremendous and
ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first
saw it. It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave
wings to the soul, and allowed it to soar from the obscure world
to light and joy. The sight of the awful and majestic in
nature had indeed always the effect of solemnizing my mind, and
causing me to forget the passing cares of life. I determined to go without a
guide, for I was well acquainted with the path, and the
presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the
scene.</p>

<p>The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short windings, which enable you to
surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain. It is a scene terrifically
desolate. In a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be
perceived, where trees lie broken and
strewed on the ground; some entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning upon
the jutting rocks of the mountain, or transversely upon other trees. The
path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines of snow, down which
stones continually roll from above; one of them is particularly dangerous,
as the slightest sound, such as even speaking in a loud voice, produces a
concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the
speaker. The pines are not tall or
luxuriant, but they are sombre, and add an air of severity to the scene. I
looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers which
ran through it, and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite
mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain poured
from the dark sky, and added to the melancholy impression I received from
the objects around me. Alas! why does man boast of sensibilities superior to
those apparent in the brute; it only renders them more necessary beings.
If our impulses were confined to hunger, thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we
are moved by every wind that blows, and a chance word or scene that that</p>
word may convey to us.

<lg>

<p>It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent.
For some time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice.
A mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains. Presently
a breeze dissipated the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier.
The surface is very uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled
sea, descending low, and interspersed by rifts that sink deep.
The field of ice is almost a league
in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. The opposite
mountain is a bare
perpendicular rock. From the side where I now stood Montanvert
was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league; and above it
rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recess of the
rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. The sea, or rather the vast river of ice, wound
among its dependent mountains, whose aërial summits hung over its
recesses. Their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the
clouds. My heart, which was before sorrowful, now swelled with something
like joy; I exclaimed—"Wandering
spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds, allow
me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion, away from the joys
of life."</p>

<p>As I said this, I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,
advancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the crevices
in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his stature, also, as
he approached, seemed to exceed that of man. I was troubled: a mist came
over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me; but I was quickly restored
by the cold gale of the mountains. I perceived, as the shape came nearer,
(sight tremendous and abhorred!) that
it was the wretch whom I had
created. I trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait his approach,
and then close with him in mortal combat. He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter
anguish, combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly
ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely
observed this; rage and hatred had at
first deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to overwhelm him with
words expressive of furious detestation and contempt.</p>

<p>"Devil!" I exclaimed, "do you dare
approach me? and do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on
your miserable head?Begone, vile insect! or rather stay,
that I may trample you to dust! and, oh! that I could, with the extinction
of your miserable existence, restore those victims whom you have so
diabolically murdered!"</p>

<p>"I expected this reception," said the dæmon. "All men hate the wretched; how, then, must I be
hated, who am miserable beyond all
living things! Yet you, my
creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the
annihilation of one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life? Do your duty towards me, and I will do
mine towards you and the rest of mankind. If you will comply with my
conditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, I will
glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your
remaining friends."</p>

<p>"Abhorred monster! fiend that thou art! the tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes. Wretched devil! you reproach me with your
creation; come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I so
negligently bestowed."<lb/> My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him,
impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being against the existence
of another.</p>

<p>He easily eluded me, and said—
</p>

<p>"Be calm! I entreat you to hear me, before you give vent to your hatred on
my devoted head. Have I not suffered
enough, that you seek to increase my misery? Life, although it may only be
an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it. Remember,
thou hast made me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to
thine; my joints more supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee. I am
thy creature, and I will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and
king, if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me. Oh,
Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other, and trample upon me alone,
to whom thy justice, and even thy
clemency and affection, is most due. Remember, that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy Adam; but I am rather
the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed. Every where I
see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy,
and I shall again be virtuous."</p>

<p>"Begone! I will not hear you. There can
be no community between you and me; we are enemies. Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight, in which
one must fall."</p>

<p>"How can I move thee? Will no
entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature, who
implores thy goodness and compassion? Believe me, Frankenstein: I was benevolent; my soul glowed with
love and humanity: but am I not alone, miserably alone? You, my
creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow-creatures, who
owe me nothing? they spurn and hate me. The desert mountains and dreary glaciers
are my refuge. I have wandered here many days; the caves of ice, which I
only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the only one which man does
not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they are kinder to me than your
fellow-beings. If the multitude of
mankind knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm
themselves for my destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me? I will keep no terms with my enemies.
I am miserable, and they shall share my
wretchedness. Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver
them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that not only you and your family, but
thousands of others, shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage.
Let your compassion be moved, and do not disdain me. Listen to my tale:
when you have heard that, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge
that I deserve. But hear me. The guilty
are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they are, to speak in their own
defence before they are condemned. Listen to me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of murder; and yet you
would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise
the eternal justice of man! Yet I ask you not to spare me: listen to me;
and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands."</p>

<p>"Why do you call to my remembrance," I rejoined, "circumstances, of which
I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and author?
Cursed be the day, abhorred devil,
in which you first saw light! Cursed
(although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you! You have made me wretched beyond
expression. You have left me no
power to consider whether I am just to you, or not. Begone! relieve me
from the sight of your detested form."</p>

<p>"Thus I relieve thee, my creator,"
he said, and placed his hated hands before my eyes, which I flung from me
with violence;  "thus I take from thee a sight which you abhor. Still thou
canst listen to me, and grant me thy
compassion. By the virtues that I
once possessed, I demand this from you. Hear my tale; it is long and
strange, and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine
sensations; come to the hut upon the
mountain. The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends to hide
itself behind yon snowy precipices, and illuminate another world, you will
have heard my story, and can decide. On you it rests, whether I quit
forever the neighbourhood of man, and lead a harmless life, or become the
scourge of your fellow-creatures, and the author of your own speedy
ruin."</p>

<p>As he said this, he led the way across the ice: I followed.
My heart was full, and I did not answer him; but, as I proceeded, I
weighed the various arguments that he had used, and determined at
least to listen to his tale. I was partly urged by
curiosity, and
compassion confirmed my resolution. I had hitherto supposed him
to be the murderer of my brother, and I eagerly sought a
confirmation or denial of this opinion. For the first time, also,
I felt what the duties of a creator towards his
creature were,
and that I ought to render him happy before I complained of his
wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with his demand. We
crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite rock. The
air was cold, and the rain again began to descend: we entered the
hut, the fiend with an air of
exultation, I with a heavy heart, and depressed spirits. But I
consented to listen; and, seating myself by the fire which my odious
companion had lighted, he thus
began his tale.</p>

     <head>Chapter 11</head>
     <p>"IT is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of my being: all the events of that
         period appear confused and indistinct. A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt, at the same time; and it was,
         indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. By degrees, I
         remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I was obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over
         me, and troubled me; but hardly had I felt this, when, by opening my eyes, as I now suppose, the light poured in
         upon me again. I walked, and, I believe, descended;
         but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations. Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me,
         impervious to my touch or sight; but I now found that I
         could wander on at liberty, with no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. The light became
         more and more oppressive to me; and, the heat wearying me as I walked, I sought a place where I could receive
         shade. This was the forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue, until I
         felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I
         found hanging on the trees, or lying on the ground. I slaked my thirst at the brook; and then lying down, was
         overcome by sleep. </p>
         
         <p>"It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and
             half-frightened, as it were instinctively, finding
             myself so desolate. Before I had quitted your apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with
             some clothes; but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night. I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could distinguish,
             nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat
             down and wept.</p>
    
         <p>"Soon a gentle light stole over the
             heavens, and gave me a sensation of pleasure. I started up, and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees. I
             gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly, but it enlightened my path; and I again went out in search of
             berries. I was still cold, when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with which I covered myself, and sat
             down upon the ground. No distinct ideas occupied my mind; all was confused. I felt light, and hunger, and thirst,
             and darkness; innumerable sounds rung in my ears, and on all sides various scents saluted me: the only object that
             I could distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with pleasure.</p>
     
         <p>"Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had greatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my
             sensations from each other. I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink, and the trees
             that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted when I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often
             saluted my ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from
             my eyes. I began also to observe, with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me, and to perceive the
             boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me. Sometimes I tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the
             birds, but was unable. Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me
             frightened me into silence again.</p>
     
         <p>"The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a
             lessened form, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest. My sensations had, by this time,
             become distinct, and my mind received every day additional ideas. My eyes became accustomed to the light, and to
             perceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from the herb, and, by degrees, one herb from
             another. I found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were
             sweet and enticing.</p>
     
         <p>"One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at
             the warmth I experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers, but quickly drew it out again
             with a cry of pain. How strange, I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects! I examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it
             to be composed of wood. I quickly collected some branches; but they were wet, and would not burn. I was pained at
             this, and sat still watching the operation of the fire. The wet wood which I had placed near the heat dried, and
             itself became inflamed. I reflected on this; and, by touching the various branches, I discovered the cause, and
             busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it, and have a plentiful supply of fire.
             When night came on, and brought sleep with it, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. I
             covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves, and placed wet branches upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I
             lay on the ground, and sunk into sleep. </p>
     </item>
     <item>
         <p>"It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire. I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly
             fanned it into a flame. I observed this also, and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the embers when they
             were nearly extinguished. When night came again, I found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat;
             and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food; for I found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been
             roasted, and tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees. I tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on
             the live embers. I found that the berries were spoiled by this operation, and the nuts and roots much
             improved.</p>
     
         <p>"Food, however, became scarce; and I often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to
             assuage the pangs of hunger. When I found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited, to
             seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied. In this emigration, I exceedingly
             lamented the loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident, and knew not how to reproduce it. I gave
             several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty; but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to
             supply it; and, wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood towards the setting sun. I passed three days in
             these rambles, and at length discovered the open
             country. A great fall of snow had taken place
             the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet
             chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground.</p>
     
         <p>"It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on
             a rising ground, which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. This was a new sight to me;
             and I examined the structure with great curiosity. Finding the door open, I entered. An old man sat in it, near a
             fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast. He turned on hearing a noise; and, perceiving me, shrieked
             loudly, and, quitting the hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared
             capable. His appearance, different from any I had ever
             before seen, and his flight, somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted by the appearance of the hut: here
             the snow and rain could not penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a
             retreat as Pandæmonium appeared to the
             dæmons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire. I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd's
             breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese, milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like. Then, overcome
             by fatigue, I lay down among some straw, and fell asleep.</p>
     
         <p>"It was noon when I awoke; and, allured by the warmth of the sun, which shone brightly on the white
             ground, I determined to recommence my travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant's breakfast in a wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for
             several hours, until at sunset I arrived at a
             village. How miraculous did this appear! the huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses, engaged my admiration
             by turns. The vegetables in the gardens, the milk
             and cheese that I saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One of the best of these
             I entered; but I had hardly placed my foot within the door, before the children shrieked, and one of the women
             fainted. The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until, grievously bruised by stones and many
             other kinds of missile weapons, I escaped to the open country, and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel, quite
             bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had beheld in the village. This hovel, however, joined
             a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance; but, after my late dearly bought experience, I dared not enter it. My place of refuge was
             constructed of wood, but so low, that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No wood, however, was placed on
             the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found
             it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.</p>
     
         <p>"Here then I retreated, and lay down happy to have found a shelter, however miserable, from the inclemency of the
             season, and still more from the barbarity of
             man.</p>
     
         <p>"Having thus arranged my dwelling, and carpeted it with clean straw, I retired; for I saw the figure
             of a man at a distance, and I remembered too well my treatment the night before, to trust myself in his power. I
             had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day, by a loaf of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a
             cup with which I could drink, more conveniently than from my hand, of the pure water which flowed by my retreat.
             The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the
             cottage it was tolerably warm.</p>
     
         <p>"Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel, until something should occur which might alter my
             determination. It was indeed a paradise, compared to
             the bleak forest, my former residence, the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with
             pleasure, and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water, when I heard a step, and looking
             through a small chink, I beheld a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. The girl was
             young, and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since
             found cottagers and farm-house servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a coarse blue petticoat and a linen
             jacket being her only garb; her fair hair was plaited, but not adorned; she looked patient, yet sad. I lost sight
             of her; and in about a quarter of an hour she returned, bearing the pail, which was now partly filled with milk.
             As she walked along, seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose countenance expressed a deeper
             despondence. Uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head, and bore it to the
             cottage himself. She followed, and they disappeared. Presently I saw the young man again, with some tools in his
             hand, cross the field behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the house, and sometimes in
             the yard.</p>
     
         <p>"On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a
             part of it, but the panes had been filled up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost imperceptible
             chink, through which the eye could just penetrate. Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and
             clean, but very bare of furniture. In one corner,
             near a small fire, sat an old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. The young girl was
             occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she took something out of a drawer, which employed her
             hands, and she sat down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play, and to produce sounds
             sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch! who had never beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent
             countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love. He played
             a sweet mournful air, which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he
             then pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet. He raised her, and
             smiled with such kindness and affection, that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature: they were a
             mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never
             before experienced, either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the window, unable to bear
             these emotions.</p>
     
         <p>"Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a load of wood. The girl met him at the door,
             helped to relieve him of his burden, and, taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on the fire; then
             she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage, and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed pleased, and went into the garden for
             some roots and plants, which she placed in water,
             and then upon the fire. She afterwards continued her work, whilst the young man went into the garden, and appeared
             busily employed in digging and pulling up roots. After he had been employed thus about an hour, the young woman
             joined him, and they entered the cottage together.</p>
     
         <p>"The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive; but, on the appearance of his companions, he
             assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to eat. The meal was quickly dispatched. The young woman was again
             occupied in arranging the cottage; the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on
             the arm of the youth. Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures. One was
             old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in
             his figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry; yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost
             sadness and despondency. The old man returned to the cottage; and the youth, with tools different from those he
             had used in the morning, directed his steps across the fields.</p>
     
         <p>"Night quickly shut in; but, to my extreme wonder, I found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by
             the use of tapers, and was delighted to find that the
             setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours. In the
             evening, the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations which I did not understand; and the
             old man again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning. So
             soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play, but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither
             resembling the harmony of the old man's instrument nor the songs of the birds: I since found that he read aloud,
             but at that time I knew nothing of the science of words or letters.</p>

             <p>"I LAY on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the occurrences of the day. What chiefly
                 struck me was the gentle manners of these people; and I longed to join them, but dared not. I remembered too well
                 the treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of
                 conduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would remain quietly in my hovel, watching, and
                 endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions.</p>
     
         <p>"The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun.
             The young woman arranged the cottage, and prepared the food; and the youth departed after the first meal.</p>
     
         <p>"This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it. The young man was constantly employed out of
             doors, and the girl in various laborious occupations within. The old man, whom I soon perceived to be blind,
             employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation. Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers
             exhibited towards their venerable companion. They performed towards him every little office of affection and duty
             with gentleness; and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.</p>
     
         <p>"They were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion often went apart, and appeared to
             weep. I saw no cause for their unhappiness; but I was deeply affected by it. If such lovely creatures were miserable, it was less
             strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being,
             should be wretched. Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? They possessed a delightful house (for such it was
             in my eyes) and every luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill, and delicious viands when hungry; they were
             dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more, they enjoyed one another's company and speech, interchanging each
             day looks of affection and kindness. What did their tears
             imply? Did they really express pain? I was at first unable to solve these questions; but perpetual
             attention and time explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic.</p>
     
         <p>"A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable family: it
             was poverty; and they suffered that evil in a very
             distressing degree. Their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden, and the milk of one
             cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it. They
             often, I believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two younger cottagers; for several
             times they placed food before the old man, when they reserved none for themselves.</p>
     
         <p>"This trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been
             accustomed, during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own consumption; but when I found that in
             doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I abstained, and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and roots, which I gathered from a
             neighbouring wood.</p>
     
         <p>"I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist their labours. I found that
             the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire; and, during the night, I often
             took his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of
             several days.</p>
     
         <p>"I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she opened the door in the morning, appeared
             greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the
             youth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure, that he did not go to the forest that
             day, but spent it in repairing the cottage, and cultivating the garden.</p>
     
         <p>"By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that these people possessed a method of
             communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words they
             spoke sometimes, produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and countenances of the hearers. This
             was indeed a godlike science, and I ardently desired
             to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in every attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was
             quick; and the words they uttered, not having any apparent connexion with visible objects, I was unable to
             discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference. By great application, however, and
             after having remained during the space of several
             revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I discovered
             the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; I learned and applied the
             words, fire, milk, bread, and wood. I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth and
             his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only one, which was father. The girl was
             called sister, or Agatha; and the youth Felix, brother, or son. I cannot
             describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds, and was able to
             pronounce them. I distinguished several other words, without being able as yet to understand or apply them; such as good,
             dearest, unhappy.</p>

         <p>"I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared
             them to me; when they were unhappy, I felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys. I saw few human beings
             beside them; and if any other happened to enter the cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me
             the superior accomplishments of my friends. The old man, I could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage his
             children, as sometimes I found that he called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a cheerful
             accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes
             sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I generally found that her
             countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus with
             Felix. He was always the saddest of the group; and, even to my unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered
             more deeply than his friends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful than that of
             his sister, especially when he addressed the old man.</p>
     
         <p>"I could mention innumerable instances, which, although slight, marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers.
             In the midst of poverty and want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from
             beneath the snowy ground. Early in the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that obstructed her
             path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and brought the wood from the out-house, where, to his perpetual
             astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand. In the day, I believe, he worked
             sometimes for a neighbouring farmer, because he often went forth, and did not return until dinner, yet brought no
             wood with him. At other times he worked in the garden; but, as there was little to do in the frosty season, he
             read to the old man and Agatha.</p>
     
         <p>"This reading had puzzled me extremely at first; but, by degrees, I discovered that he uttered many
             of the same sounds when he read, as when he talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs for
             speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend these also; but how was that possible, when I did
             not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs? I improved, however, sensibly in this science, but
             not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour: for I
             easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers, I ought not to make the
             attempt until I had first become master of their language; which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook
             the deformity of my figure; for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me
             acquainted.</p>
     
         <p>"I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers -- their grace, beauty, and delicate complexions: but how was I
             terrified, when I viewed myself in a transparent
             pool! At first I started back, unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and
             when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the
             monster that I am, I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification. Alas! I
             did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity.</p>
     
         <p>"As the sun became warmer, and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the
             black earth. From this time Felix was more employed; and the heart-moving indications of impending famine
             disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards found, was coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency
             of it. Several new kinds of plants sprung up in the garden, which they dressed; and these signs of comfort increased
             daily as the season advanced.</p>
     
         <p>"The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did not rain, as I found it was
             called when the heavens poured forth its waters. This
             frequently took place; but a high wind quickly dried the earth, and the season became far more pleasant
             than it had been.</p>
     
         <p>"My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning, I attended the motions of the cottagers; and when
             they were dispersed in various occupations, I slept: the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends.
             When they had retired to rest, if there was any moon, or the night was star-light, I went into the woods, and
             collected my own food and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I cleared their
             path of the snow, and performed those offices that I had seen done by Felix. I afterwards found that these
             labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and once or twice I heard them, on these
             occasions, utter the words good spirit, wonderful; but I did not then understand the signification of these terms.</p>
     <
         <p>"My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I
             was inquisitive to know why Felix appeared so miserable, and Agatha so sad. I thought (foolish wretch!) that it
             might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people. When I slept, or was absent, the forms of the
             venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix, flitted before me. I looked upon them as
             superior beings, who would be the arbiters of my future destiny. I formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting
             myself to them, and their reception of me. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour
             and conciliating words, I should first win their favour, and afterwards their love.</p>
     
         <p>"These thoughts exhilarated me, and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but
             supple: and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I pronounced such words as I
             understood with tolerable ease. It was as the ass and the
             lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass, whose intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment than blows and
             execration.</p>
     
         <p>"The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth. Men, who before this
             change seemed to have been hid in caves, dispersed themselves, and were employed in various arts of cultivation.
             The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees. Happy, happy earth! fit
             habitation for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome. My spirits were elevated by
             the enchanting appearance of nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was
             tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of hope, and anticipations of joy.</p>

             <head>Chapter 13</head>
             <p>"I NOW hasten to the more moving part of my story. I shall relate events,
                 that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had
                 been, have made me what I am. </p>
     
         <p>"Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine, and the skies cloudless. It surprised me, that what before was
             desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. My senses were gratified and
             refreshed by a thousand scents of delight, and a thousand sights of beauty.</p>
     
         <p>"It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from labour—the old man played on his
             guitar, and the children listened to him—that I observed the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond
             expression; he sighed frequently; and once his father paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he
             inquired the cause of his son's sorrow. Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his
             music, when some one tapped at the door. </p>
     
         <p>"It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a countryman
             as a guide. The lady was dressed in a dark suit, and covered with a thick black veil. Agatha asked a question; to
             which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix. Her voice was musical, but
             unlike that of either of my friends. On hearing this word, Felix came up hastily to the lady; who, when she saw
             him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of
             angelic beauty and expression. Her hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were
             dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair,
             each cheek tinged with a lovely pink.</p>
     
         <p>"Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished from his face,
             and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes
             sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger. She
             appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held out her hand to Felix,
             who kissed it rapturously, and called her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear
             to understand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and, dismissing her guide, conducted her into the
             cottage. Some conversation took place between him and his father; and the young stranger knelt at the old man's
             feet, and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her, and embraced her affectionately. </p>
     
         <p>"I soon perceived, that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds, and appeared to have a language of her
             own, she was neither understood by, nor herself
             understood, the cottagers. They made many signs which I did not comprehend; but I saw that her presence
             diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists. Felix
             seemed peculiarly happy, and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed
             the hands of the lovely stranger; and, pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he
             had been sorrowful until she came. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the
             cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the
             stranger repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly occurred
             to me, that I should make use of the same instructions
             to the same end. The stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson, most of them, indeed, were
             those which I had before understood, but I profited by the others.</p>
     
         <p>"As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early. When they separated, Felix kissed the hand
             of the stranger, and said, 'Good night, sweet Safie.' He sat up much longer, conversing with his father; and, by
             the frequent repetition of her name, I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation.
             I ardently desired to understand them, and bent
             every faculty towards that purpose, but found it utterly impossible.</p>
     
         <p>"The next morning Felix went out to his work; and, after the usual occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian
             sat at the feet of the old man, and, taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful, that they at
             once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes.
             She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or dying away, like a nightingale of the woods. </p>
     
         <p>"When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first declined it. She played a simple air, and her
             voice accompanied it in sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old man appeared
             enraptured, and said some words, which Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to
             express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music. </p>
     
         <p>"The days now passed as peacefully as before, with the sole alteration, that joy had taken the place of sadness in
             the countenances of my friends. Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the knowledge of
             language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors. </p>
     
         <p>"In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and the green banks interspersed
             with innumerable flowers, sweet to the scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods;
             the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me,
             although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun; for I never ventured
             abroad during day-light, fearful of meeting with the same treatment I had formerly endured in the first village
             which I entered. </p>
     
         <p>"My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily master the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the Arabian, who
             understood very little, and conversed in broken accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word
             that was spoken. </p>
     
         <p>"While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of
             letters, as it was taught to the stranger; and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight.
         </p>
     
         <p>"The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney's 'Ruins of Empires.' I should not have understood the purport of this book, had not Felix, in reading it,
             given very minute explanations. He had chosen this work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in
             imitation of the eastern authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history, and a view of the
             several empires at present existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and
             religions of the different nations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics; of the stupendous genius and
             mental activity of the Grecians; of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early Romans -- of their subsequent
             degenerating -- of the decline of that mighty empire; of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard of the
             discovery of the American hemisphere, and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants.</p>
     
         <p>"These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous, and magnificent, yet so
             vicious and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle, and at another, as all that
             can be conceived of noble and godlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall
             a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a
             condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. For a long time I could not conceive how one
             man could go forth to murder his fellow, or even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of
             vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased, and I turned away with disgust and loathing.</p>
    
         <p>"Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me. While I listened to the instructions which Felix
             bestowed upon the Arabian, the strange system of human
             society was explained to me. I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty;
             of rank, descent, and noble blood.</p>
    
         <p>"The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow-creatures
             were, high and unsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with only one of these advantages;
             but, without either, he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen
             few. And what was I? Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant; but I knew that I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of
             property. I was, besides, endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the same
             nature as man. I was more agile than they, and could subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and
             cold with less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked around, I saw and heard of none
             like me. Was I then a monster, a blot upon the
             earth, from which all men fled, and whom all men disowned? </p>
     
         <p>"I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me: I tried to dispel
             them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge. Oh,
             that I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat! </p>
    
         <p>"Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to
             the mind, when it has once seized on it, like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to shake off all thought
             and feeling; but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was
             death—a state which I feared yet did not understand. I admired virtue and good feelings, and loved the
             gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers; but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except
             through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased than
             satisfied the desire I had of becoming one among my fellows. The gentle words of Agatha, and the animated smiles
             of the charming Arabian, were not for me. The mild exhortations of the old man, and the lively conversation of the
             loved Felix, were not for me. Miserable, unhappy
             wretch! </p>
     
         <p>"Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply.
             I heard of the difference of sexes; and the birth and growth of children; how the father doated on the smiles of
             the infant, and the lively sallies of the older child; how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in
             the precious charge; how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge; of brother, sister, and all the various
             relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds. </p>
     
         <p>"But where were my friends and relations? No father had watched my infant days, no mother had
             blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I distinguished nothing. From
             my earliest remembrance I had been as I then was in height and proportion. I had never yet seen a being resembling
             me, or who claimed any intercourse with me. What was I? The question again recurred, to be answered only with
             groans. </p>
     
         <p>"I will soon explain to what these feelings tended; but allow me now to return to the cottagers, whose story
             excited in me such various feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated in additional
             love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in an innocent, half painful self-deceit, to call them).</p>

             <head>Chapter 14</head>
             
             <p>"SOME time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends. It was one which could not fail to
                 impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding as it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to
                 one so utterly inexperienced as I was.</p>
     
         <p>"The name of the old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a good family in France, where he had lived for many
             years in affluence, respected by his superiors, and beloved by his equals. His son was bred in the service of his country; and
             Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction. A few months before my arrival, they had lived in a
             large and luxurious city, called Paris, surrounded by friends, and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue,
             refinement of intellect, or taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.</p>
   
         <p>"The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin. He was a Turkish merchant, and had inhabited Paris for many
             years, when, for some reason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government. He was seized and cast
             into prison the very day that Safie arrived from
             Constantinople to join him. He was tried, and
             condemned to death. The injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant; and it was
             judged that his religion and wealth, rather than the crime alleged against him, had been the cause of his
             condemnation. </p>
     
         <p>"Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and indignation were uncontrollable,
             when he heard the decision of the court. He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him, and then looked around for
             the means. After many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an
             unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate Mahometan; who, loaded with chains,
             waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence. Felix visited the grate at night, and made known to the
             prisoner his intentions in his favour. The Turk, amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his
             deliverer by promises of reward and wealth. Felix rejected his offers with contempt; yet when he saw the lovely
             Safie, who was allowed to visit her father, and who, by her gestures, expressed her lively gratitude, the youth
             could not help owning to his own mind, that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and
             hazard. </p>
     
         <p>"The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of Felix, and endeavoured to
             secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage, so soon as he should be conveyed
             to a place of safety. Felix was too delicate to accept
             this offer; yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to that consummation of his
             happiness. </p>
     
         <p>"During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant, the zeal of
             Felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to express her
             thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man, a servant of her father, who understood French.
             She thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent; and at the same time deeply
             deplored her own fate. </p>
     
         <p>"I have copies of these letters; for I found means, during my residence in the hovel, to procure the
             implements of writing; and the letters were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha. Before I depart, I will give
             them to you, they will prove the truth of my tale;
             but at present, as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat the substance of them to you.
         </p>
     
         <p>"Safie related, that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a slave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty,
             she had won the heart of the father of Safie, who married her. The young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms
             of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced. She instructed her daughter in the tenets of her
             religion, and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect, and an independence of spirit, forbidden to the female followers of Mahomet. This
             lady died; but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again
             returning to Asia, and being immured within the walls of a haram, allowed only to occupy herself with infantile
             amusements, ill suited to the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue.
             The prospect of marrying a Christian, and remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in society, was
             enchanting to her. </p>
     
         <p>"The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed; but, on the night previous to it, he quitted his prison, and
             before morning was distant many leagues from Paris. Felix had procured passports in the name of his father,
             sister, and himself. He had previously communicated his plan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his
             house, under the pretence of a journey, and concealed himself, with his daughter, in an obscure part of Paris.</p>
     
         <p>"Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons, and across Mont Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a
             favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions. </p>
     
         <p>"Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure, before which time the Turk renewed his
             promise that she should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in expectation of that event; and
             in the mean time he enjoyed the society of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest
             affection. They conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter, and sometimes with the
             interpretation of looks; and Safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country. </p>
     
         <p>"The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place, and encouraged the hopes of the youthful
             lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other plans. He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a Christian; but he
             feared the resentment of Felix, if he should appear lukewarm; for he knew that he was still in the power of his
             deliverer, if he should choose to betray him to the
             Italian state which they inhabited. He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong
             the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed. His
             plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris. </p>
     
         <p>"The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim, and spared no pains to
             detect and punish his deliverer. The plot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were thrown
             into prison. The news reached Felix, and roused him from his dream of pleasure. His blind and aged father, and his
             gentle sister, lay in a noisome dungeon, while he enjoyed the free air, and the society of her whom he loved. This
             idea was torture to him. He quickly arranged with the Turk, that if the latter should find a favourable
             opportunity for escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at
             Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian, he hastened to Paris, and delivered himself up to the vengeance of
             the law, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding. </p>
     
         <p>"He did not succeed. They remained confined for five months before the trial took place; the result of which deprived
             them of their fortune, and condemned them to a perpetual
             exile from their native country. </p>
     
         <p>"They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I discovered them. Felix soon learned that the
             treacherous Turk, for whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on discovering that his deliverer
             was thus reduced to poverty and ruin, became a traitor to good feeling and honour, and had quitted Italy with his
             daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money, to aid him, as he said, in some plan of future
             maintenance. </p>
    
         <p>"Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix, and rendered him, when I first saw him, the most miserable
             of his family. He could have endured poverty; and while this distress had been the meed of his virtue, he gloried
             in it: but the ingratitude of the Turk, and the loss of his beloved Safie, were misfortunes more bitter and
             irreparable. The arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul. </p>
     
         <p>"When the news reached Leghorn, that Felix was deprived of his wealth and rank, the merchant
             commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover, but to prepare to return to her native country. The generous
             nature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to expostulate with her father, but he left her
             angrily, reiterating his tyrannical mandate. </p>
    
         <p>"A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter's apartment, and told her hastily, that he had reason to believe
             that his residence at Leghorn had been divulged, and that he should speedily be delivered up to the French
             government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a
             few hours. He intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant, to follow at her leisure
             with the greater part of his property, which had not
             yet arrived at Leghorn. </p>
    
         <p>"When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in this
             emergency. A residence in Turkey was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike adverse to it. By
             some papers of her father, which fell into her hands, she heard of the exile of her lover, and learnt the name of
             the spot where he then resided. She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her determination. Taking with
             her some jewels that belonged to her, and a sum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of
             Leghorn, but who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for Germany. </p>
     
         <p>"She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage of De Lacey, when her attendant fell
             dangerously ill. Safie nursed her with the most
             devoted affection; but the poor girl died, and the
             Arabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country, and utterly ignorant of the customs of the
             world. She fell, however, into good hands. The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were
             bound; and, after her death, the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in
             safety at the cottage of her lover. </p>

             <head>Chapter 15</head>
             <p>"SUCH was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed me deeply. I learned, from the views of
                 social life which it developed, to admire their virtues, and to deprecate the vices of mankind. </p>
     
         <p>"As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil;
             benevolence and generosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy
             scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed. But, in giving an account of the progress
             of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the beginning of the month of August of the same
             year. </p>
     
         <p>"One night, during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood, where I collected my own food, and brought home
             firing for my protectors, I found on the ground a leathern portmanteau, containing several articles of dress and some books. I
             eagerly seized the prize, and returned with it to my hovel. Fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I
             had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of 'Paradise Lost,' a volume of 'Plutarch's Lives,' and the 'Sorrows of Werter.' The possession of these treasures
             gave me extreme delight; I now continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends
             were employed in their ordinary occupations. </p>
     
         <p>"I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced in me an infinity of new
             images and feelings, that sometimes raised me to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection.
             In the 'Sorrows of Werter,' besides the interest of its simple and affecting story, so many opinions are
             canvassed, and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects, that I found in it a
             never-ending source of speculation and astonishment. The gentle and domestic manners it described, combined with
             lofty sentiments and feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded well with my experience among my protectors, and with the wants which
             were for ever alive in my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a more divine being than I had ever beheld or
             imagined; his character contained no pretension, but it sunk deep. The disquisitions upon death and suicide were
             calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards
             the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely understanding it. </p>
     
         <p>"As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and condition. I found myself similar, yet at the
             same time strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom I read, and to whose conversation I was a listener. I sympathised with, and partly understood them, but
             I was unformed in mind; I was dependent on none, and related to none. 'The path of my departure was free;' and there was none
             to lament my annihilation. My person was hideous, and my stature gigantic? What did this mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I
             come? What was my destination? These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to solve them. </p>
     
         <p>"The volume of 'Plutarch's Lives,' which I possessed, contained the histories of the first founders
             of the ancient republics. This book had a far different effect upon me from the 'Sorrows of Werter.' I learned
             from Werter's imaginations despondency and gloom: but
             Plutarch taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections, to
             admire and love the heroes of past ages. Many things I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had a
             very confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers, and boundless seas. But I was
             perfectly unacquainted with towns, and large assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the only
             school in which I had studied human nature; but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action. I read of
             men concerned in public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise
             within me, and abhorrence for vice, as far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they were,
             as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable
             law givers, Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and
             Theseus. The patriarchal lives of my protectors
             caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had been
             made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should have been imbued with different sensations.</p>
     
         <p>"But 'Paradise Lost' excited different and far deeper emotions. I read it, as I had read the other
             volumes which had fallen into my hands, as a true
             history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe, that the picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was
             capable of exciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity struck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to any
             other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine in every other respect. He had come forth from
             the hands of God a perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he was
             allowed to converse with, and acquire knowledge from, beings of a superior nature: but I was wretched, helpless,
             and alone. Many times I considered Satan as the fitter
             emblem of my condition; for often, like him, when I
             viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me.</p>
     
         <p>"Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon after my arrival in the hovel, I discovered
             some papers in the pocket of the dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had neglected them; but
             now that I was able to decipher the characters in which they were written, I began to study them with diligence.
             It was your journal of the four months that preceded
             my creation. You minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress of your work; this history
             was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences. You, doubtless, recollect these papers. Here they are. Every
             thing is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin; the whole detail of that series of
             disgusting circumstances which produced it, is set in view; the minutest description of my odious and loathsome
             person is given, in language which painted your own horrors, and rendered mine indelible. I sickened as I read.
             'Hateful day when I received life!' I exclaimed
             in agony. 'Accursed creator! Why did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned from me in disgust?
             God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even
             from the very resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow-devils, to admire and encourage him; but I am solitary and abhorred.' </p>
     
         <p>"These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude; but when I contemplated the
             virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and benevolent
             dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted with my admiration of their
             virtues, they would compassionate me, and overlook my personal deformity. Could they turn from their door one,
             however monstrous, who solicited their compassion and friendship? I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in
             every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate. I postponed this attempt for some
             months longer; for the importance attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail. Besides, I
             found that my understanding improved so much with every day's experience, that I was unwilling to commence this
             undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity. </p>
    
         <p>"Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage. The presence of Safie diffused happiness among its
             inhabitants; and I also found that a greater degree of
             plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in
             their labours by servants. They did not appear rich, but they were contented and happy; their feelings were serene
             and peaceful, while mine became every day more tumultuous. Increase of knowledge only discovered to me more
             clearly what a wretched outcast I was. I cherished hope, it is true; but it vanished, when I beheld my
             person reflected in water, or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail image and that inconstant shade. </p>
    
         <p>"I endeavoured to crush these fears, and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months I resolved to
             undergo; and sometimes I allowed my thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and dared
             to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic
             countenances breathed smiles of consolation. But it was all
             a dream: no Eve soothed my sorrows, nor shared my thoughts; I was alone. I remembered Adam's supplication to his Creator; but where was
             mine? He had abandoned me; and, in the bitterness of my heart, I cursed him. </p>
     
         <p>"Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay and fall, and nature again
             assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I did
             not heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my conformation for the endurance of cold than heat.
             But my chief delights were the sight of the flowers,
             the birds, and all the gay apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention towards the
             cottagers. Their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer. They loved, and sympathised with one
             another; and their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the casualties that took place around
             them. The more I saw of them, the greater became my
             desire to claim their protection and kindness; my heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable
             creatures: to see their sweet looks directed towards me with affection, was the utmost limit of my ambition. I
             dared not think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror. The poor that stopped at their door
             were never driven away. I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a little food or rest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not
             believe myself utterly unworthy of it. </p>
     
     
         <p>"The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the
             seasons had taken place since I awoke into life. My attention, at this time, was solely directed towards my plan
             of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors. I revolved many projects; but that on which I finally
             fixed was, to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone. I had sagacity enough to discover, that
             the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me. My
             voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I thought, therefore, that if, in the absence of his children,
             I could gain the good-will and mediation of the old De
             Lacey, I might, by his means, be tolerated by my younger protectors. </p>
     
         <p>"One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground, and diffused cheerfulness,
             although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha, and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own
             desire, was left alone in the cottage. When his children had departed, he took up his guitar, and played several
             mournful but sweet airs, more sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before. At first his countenance
             was illuminated with pleasure, but, as he continued, thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside
             the instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection. </p>
   
         <p>"My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which would decide my hopes, or realise my fears. The
             servants were gone to a neighbouring fair. All was silent in and around the cottage: it was an excellent
             opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my limbs failed me, and I sank to the ground. Again I rose;
             and, exerting all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had placed before my hovel to
             conceal my retreat. The fresh air revived me, and, with renewed determination, I approached the door of their
             cottage. </p>
   
         <p>"I knocked. 'Who is there?' said the old man—'Come in.' </p>
     
         <p>"I entered; 'Pardon this intrusion,' said I: 'I am a
             traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me, if you would allow me to remain a few minutes
             before the fire.' </p>
     
         <p>"'Enter,' said De Lacey; 'and I will try in what manner I can relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children
             are from home, and, as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to procure food for you.' </p>
     
         <p>"'Do not trouble yourself, my kind host, I have food; it is warmth and rest only that I need.' </p>
    
         <p>"I sat down, and a silence ensued. I knew that every minute was precious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what
             manner to commence the interview; when the old man addressed me—</p>
     
         <p>"'By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman;—are you French?' </p>
     
         <p>"'No; but I was educated by a French family, and understand that language only. I am now going to claim the
             protection of some friends, whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.' </p>
     
         <p>"'Are they Germans?' </p>
     
         <p>"'No, they are French. But let us change the subject. I am an unfortunate and deserted creature; I look around, and
             I have no relation or friend upon earth. These
             amiable people to whom I go have never seen me, and know little of me. I am full of fears; for if I fail there, I
             am an outcast in the world for ever.' </p>
     
         <p>"'Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate; but the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious
             self-interest, are full of brotherly love and charity. Rely, therefore, on your hopes; and if these friends are
             good and amiable, do not despair.' </p>
     
         <p>"'They are kind—they are the most excellent creatures in the world; but, unfortunately, they are
             prejudiced against me. I have good dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless, and in some degree
             beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable monster.' </p>
     
         <p>"'That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot you undeceive them?' </p>
     
         <p>"'I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I feel so many overwhelming terrors. I tenderly
             love these friends; I have, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily kindness towards them;
             but they believe that I wish to injure them, and it is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.' </p>
     
         <p>"'Where do these friends reside?' </p>
    
         <p>"'Near this spot.'</p>
     
         <p>"The old man paused, and then continued, 'If you will unreservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale, I
             perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them. I am blind, and cannot judge of your countenance, but there is
             something in your words, which persuades me that you are sincere. I am poor, and an exile; but it will afford me
             true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human creature.' </p>
     
         <p>"'Excellent man! I thank you, and accept your generous offer. You raise me from the dust by this kindness; and I
             trust that, by your aid, I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow-creatures.' </p>
     
         <p>"'Heaven forbid! even if you were really criminal; for that
             can only drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue. I also am unfortunate; I and my family
             have been condemned, although innocent: judge, therefore,
             if I do not feel for your misfortunes.' </p>
     
         <p>"'How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? From your lips first have I heard the voice of kindness
             directed towards me; I shall be for ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success with those
             friends whom I am on the point of meeting.'</p>
     
         <p>"'May I know the names and residence of those friends?'</p>
     
         <p>"I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to rob me of, or bestow happiness on me forever.
             I struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my remaining strength; I
             sank on the chair, and sobbed aloud. At that moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors. I had not a moment
             to lose; but, seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, 'Now is the time!—save and protect me! You and
             your family are the friends whom I seek. Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!'</p>
     
         <p>"'Great God!' exclaimed the old man, 'who are you?'</p>
     
         <p>"At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and Agatha entered. Who can describe their horror
             and consternation on beholding me? Agatha fainted; and Safie, unable to attend to her friend, rushed out of the cottage. Felix darted forward, and with
             supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung: in a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground,
             and struck me violently with a stick. I could have torn him limb from limb, as a lion rends the antelope. But my
             heart sunk within me as with bitter sickness, and I refrained. I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when,
             overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general tumult escaped unperceived to my
             hovel.</p>

             <head>Chapter 16</head>
             <p>"CURSED, cursed creator!
                 Why did I live? Why, in that instant, did I not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed? I know not; despair had not
                 yet taken possession of me; my feelings were those of rage and revenge. I could with pleasure have destroyed the
                 cottage and its inhabitants, and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery. </p>
     
         <p>"When night came, I quitted my retreat, and wandered in the wood; and now, no longer restrained by the fear of
             discovery, I gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings. I
             was like a wild beast that had broken the toils; destroying the objects that obstructed me, and ranging
             through the wood with a stag-like swiftness. O! what a miserable night I passed! the cold stars shone in mockery,
             and the bare trees waved their branches above me: now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the
             universal stillness. All, save I, were at rest or in enjoyment: I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me; and,
             finding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up
             the trees, spread havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin. </p>
     
         <p> "But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became fatigued with excess of bodily exertion, and
             sank on the damp grass in the sick impotence of despair. There was none among the myriads of men that existed who
             would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness towards my enemies? No: from that moment I declared everlasting war against the species, and,
             more than all, against him who had formed me, and sent me forth to this insupportable misery. </p>
     
         <p>"The sun rose; I heard the voices of men, and knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat during that day.
             Accordingly I hid myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my
             situation. </p>
    
         <p>"The pleasant sunshine, and the pure air of day, restored me to some degree of tranquillity; and
             when I considered what had passed at the cottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my
             conclusions. I had certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent that my conversation had interested the father in
             my behalf, and I was a fool in having exposed my person
             to the horror of his children. I ought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to have
             discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have been prepared for my approach. But I did not
             believe my errors to be irretrievable; and, after much consideration, I resolved to return to the cottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my
             party. </p>
     
         <p>"These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound sleep; but the fever of my blood did not
             allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams. The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever acting before my
             eyes; the females were flying, and the enraged Felix tearing me from his father's feet. I awoke exhausted; and,
             finding that it was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in search of food. </p>
     
         <p>"When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the well-known path that conducted to the cottage. All
             there was at peace. I crept into my hovel, and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the
             family arose. That hour past, the sun mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear. I trembled
             violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune. The inside of the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I
             cannot describe the agony of this suspence. </p>
     
         <p>"Presently two countrymen passed by; but, pausing near the cottage, they entered into conversation,
             using violent gesticulations; but I did not
             understand what they said, as they spoke the language of
             the country, which differed from that of my
             protectors. Soon after, however, Felix approached with another man: I was surprised, as I knew that he had
             not quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover, from his discourse, the meaning of these
             unusual appearances. </p>
     
         <p>"'Do you consider,' said his companion to him, 'that
             you will be obliged to pay three months' rent, and to lose the produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any
             unfair advantage, and I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your determination.' </p>
     
         <p>"'It is utterly useless,' replied Felix, 'we can never again inhabit your cottage. The life of my father is in the
             greatest danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and my sister will never recover their
             horror. I entreat you not to reason with me any more. Take possession of your tenement, and let me fly from this
             place.'</p>
    
         <p>"Felix trembled violently as he said this. He and his
             companion entered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then departed. I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more. </p>
     
         <p>"I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid despair. My
             protectors had departed, and had broken the only link that held me to the world. For the first time the feelings
             of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not
             strive to control them; but, allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I bent my mind towards injury
             and death. When I thought of my friends, of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the
             exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished, and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me. But again, when
             I reflected that they had spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger; and, unable to injure any
             thing human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects. As night advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles
             around the cottage; and, after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden, I waited with forced
             impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations. </p>
     
         <p>"As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods, and quickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in
             the heavens: the blast tore along like a mighty avalanche, and produced a kind of insanity in my spirits, that burst all
             bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the dry branch of a tree, and danced with fury around the devoted cottage, my eyes still fixed on the
             western horizon, the edge of which the moon nearly touched. A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my
             brand; it sunk, and, with a loud scream, I fired the straw, and heath, and bushes, which I had collected. The wind
             fanned the fire, and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it, and licked it with their
             forked and destroying tongues.</p>
     
         <p>"As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the habitation, I quitted the scene, and
             sought for refuge in the woods.</p>
     
         <p>"And now, with the world before me, whither
             should I bend my steps? I resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated and
             despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length the thought of you crossed my mind. I learned from
             your papers that you were my father, my creator; and
             to whom could I apply with more fitness than to him who had given me life? Among the lessons that Felix had
             bestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted: I had learned from these the relative situations of the
             different countries of the earth. You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town; and towards this place
             I resolved to proceed.</p>
     
         <p>"But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a south-westerly direction to reach my destination;
             but the sun was my only guide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass through, nor could I ask
             information from a single human being; but I did not despair. From you only could I hope for succour, although
             towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred. Unfeeling, heartless creator! you had endowed me with perceptions and passions, and then cast me abroad
             an object for the scorn and horror of mankind. But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you
             I determined to seek that justice which I vainly
             attempted to gain from any other being that wore the human form.</p>
     
         <p>"My travels were long, and the sufferings I endured intense. It was late in autumn when I quitted the district where I
             had so long resided. I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a human being. Nature
             decayed around me, and the sun became heatless; rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the
             surface of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh, earth! how often did I imprecate curses on the
             cause of my being! The mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall and bitterness. The
             nearer I approached to your habitation, the more deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow fell, and the waters
             were hardened; but I rested not. A few incidents now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country;
             but I often wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me no respite: no incident occurred from
             which my rage and misery could not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived on the
             confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth, and the earth again began to look green, confirmed
             in an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.</p>
     
         <p>"I generally rested during the day, and travelled only when I was secured by night from the view of man. One
             morning, however, finding that my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey after the sun
             had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring, cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and
             the balminess of the air. I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long appeared dead, revive within
             me. Half surprised by the novelty of these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them; and, forgetting
             my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft
             tears again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the blessed sun which
             bestowed such joy upon me.</p>
     
         <p>"I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its boundary, which was skirted by
             a deep and rapid river, into which many of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring. Here
             I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal
             myself under the shade of a cypress. I was scarcely hid, when a young girl came running towards the spot where I
             was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from some one in sport. She continued her course along the precipitous
             sides of the river, when suddenly her foot slipt, and she fell into the rapid stream. I rushed from my
             hiding-place, and, with extreme labour from the force of the current, saved her, and dragged her to shore. She was
             senseless; and I endeavoured, by every means in my power, to restore animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by
             the approach of a rustic, who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On seeing me, he darted
             towards me, and, tearing the girl from my arms, hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed
             speedily, I hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun, which he carried, at my body, and
             fired. I sunk to the ground, and my injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.</p>
     
         <p>"This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved
             a human being from destruction, and, as a recompense, I now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound, which
             shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of kindness and gentleness, which I had entertained but a few moments
             before, gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of
             teeth. Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and
             vengeance to all mankind. But the agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted. </p>
     
         <p>"For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to cure the wound which I had
             received. The ball had entered my shoulder, and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any
             rate I had no means of extracting it. My sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction. My
             daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly
             revenge, such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured.</p>
     
         <p>"After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. The labours I endured were no longer to be
             alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery, which insulted my desolate state, and made me feel more painfully
             that I was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure.</p>
     
         <p>"But my toils now drew near a close; and, in two months from this time, I reached the environs of Geneva.</p>
     
         <p>"It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among the fields that surround it, to meditate in
             what manner I should apply to you. I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger, and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle
             breezes of evening, or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.</p>
     
         <p>"At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection, which was disturbed by the approach of a
             beautiful child, who came running into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of infancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on
             him, an idea seized me, that this little creature was unprejudiced, and had lived too short a time to have imbibed
             a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him, and educate him as my companion and friend, I should not
             be so desolate in this peopled earth. </p>
     
         <p>"Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed, and drew him towards me. As soon as he
             beheld my form, he placed his hands before his eyes,
             and uttered a shrill scream: I drew his hand forcibly from his face, and said, 'Child, what is the meaning of
             this? I do not intend to hurt you; listen to me.' </p>
     
         <p>"He struggled violently. 'Let me go,' he cried; 'monster! ugly wretch! you wish to eat me, and tear me to pieces—You are an ogre—Let me go, or I will tell my
             papa.'</p>
     
         <p>"'Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.'</p>
     
         <p>"'Hideous monster! let me go; My papa is a Syndic—he is M.
             Frankenstein—he will punish you. You dare not keep me.'</p>
     
         <p>"'Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom I have sworn eternal revenge; you shall
             be my first victim.'</p>
     
         <p>"The child still struggled, and loaded me with
             epithets which carried despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a moment he lay dead
             at my feet.</p>
    
         <p>"I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish triumph: clapping my hands, I exclaimed, 'I,
             too, can create desolation; my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and a thousand
             other miseries shall torment and destroy him.'</p>
    
     <p>"As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his breast. I took it; it was
         a portrait of a most lovely woman. In spite of my malignity, it softened and attracted me. For a few moments I gazed
         with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her lovely lips; but presently my rage returned: I
         remembered that I was for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow; and that she whose
         resemblance I contemplated would, in regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright.</p>
     
         <p>"Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? I only wonder that at that moment, instead of venting
             my sensations in exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind, and perish in the attempt to destroy them.
         </p>
     
         <p>"While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had committed the murder, and seeking a more
             secluded hiding-place, I entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A woman was sleeping on some straw;
             she was young: not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait I held; but of an agreeable aspect, and blooming in
             the loveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on
             all but me. And then I bent over her, and whispered "Awake, fairest, thy lover is near—he who would give
             his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes: my beloved, awake!" </p>
     
         <p>"The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and
             denounce the murderer? Thus would she assuredly act, if her darkened eyes opened, and she beheld me. The thought
             was madness; it stirred the fiend within me not I, but she shall suffer: the murder I have committed because I am
             for ever robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone. The crime had its source in her: be hers the
             punishment! Thanks to the lessons of Felix, and the
             sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work mischief. I bent over her, and placed the portrait
             securely in one of the folds of her dress. She moved again, and I fled.</p>
     
         <p>"For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place; sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes
             resolved to quit the world and its miseries for ever. At length I wandered towards these mountains, and have
             ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning passion which you alone can gratify. We may not part until you have promised to comply with my
             requisition. I am alone, and miserable; man will not
             associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as
             myself would not deny herself to me. My companion must be of the same species, and have the same defects.
             This being you must create."</p>

             <item>
                 <p>THE being finished speaking, and fixed
                     his looks upon me in expectation of a reply. But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to arrange my ideas
                     sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition. He continued—</p>
             
                 <p>"You must create a female for me, with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. This you alone
                     can do; and I demand it of you as a right which you
                     must not refuse to concede."</p>
            
                 <p>The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life
                     among the cottagers, and, as he said this, I could no longer
                     suppress the rage that burned within me.</p>
             
                 <p>"I do refuse it," I replied; "and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me. You may render me the most
                     miserable of men, but you shall never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create another like yourself, whose
                     joint wickedness might desolate the world. Begone! I have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never
                     consent." </p>
             
                 <p>"You are in the wrong," replied the fiend; "and, instead of threatening, I am content to
                     reason with you. I am malicious because I am miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my
                     creator, would tear me to pieces, and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I should pity man more than he
                     pities me? You would not call it murder, if you could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts, and destroy my
                     frame, the work of your own hands. Shall I respect man, when he contemns me? Let him live with me in the interchange of kindness; and, instead of injury, I
                     would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance. But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our
                     union. Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject
                     slavery. I will revenge my injuries: if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear; and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear
                     inextinguishable hatred. Have a care: I will work at your destruction, nor finish until I desolate your heart, so
                     that you shall curse the hour of your birth." </p>
             
                 <p>A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes to
                     behold; but presently he calmed himself and proceeded—</p>
            
                 <p>"I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me; for you do not reflect that you are the cause of
                     its excess. If any being felt emotions of benevolence
                     towards me, I should return them an hundred and an hundred fold; for that one creature's sake, I would make peace
                     with the whole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised. What I ask of you is reasonable
                     and moderate; I demand a creature of another sex, but as hideous as myself: the gratification is small, but it is
                     all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world;
                     but on that account we shall be more attached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will be
                     harmless, and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! my creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you
                     for one benefit! Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my request!" </p>
             
                 <p>I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences of my consent; but I felt that
                     there was some justice in his argument. His tale,
                     and the feelings he now expressed, proved him to be a
                     creature of fine sensations; and did I not as his maker, owe him all the portion of happiness that it was
                     in my power to bestow? He saw my change of feeling, and continued—</p>
             
                 <p>"If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us again: I will go to the vast wilds of South America. My
                     food is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and
                     the kid to glut my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will be of
                     the same nature as myself, and will be content with the same fare. We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun
                     will shine on us as on man, and will ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful and human, and you
                     must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of
                     power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards me, I now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the
                     favourable moment, and persuade you to promise what I so
                     ardently desire." </p>
             
                 <p>"You propose," replied I, "to fly from the habitations of man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the
                     field will be your only companions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man, persevere in this
                     exile? You will return, and again seek their kindness, and you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed, and you will
                     then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction. This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I
                     cannot consent." </p>
             
                 <p>"How inconstant are your feelings! but a moment ago you were moved by my representations, and why do
                     you again harden yourself to my complaints? I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me,
                     that, with the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man, and dwell as it may chance, in the most
                     savage of places. My evil passions will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy! my life will flow quietly away,
                     and, in my dying moments, I shall not curse my maker." </p>
             
                 <p>His words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him, and sometimes felt a wish to console him; but when I
                     looked upon him, when I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened, and my feelings were altered
                     to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle these
                     sensations; I thought, that as I could not sympathise with him, I had no right to withhold from him the
                     small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow. </p>
             
                 <p>"You swear," I said, "to be harmless; but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make
                     me distrust you? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your
                     revenge." </p>
             
                 <p>"How is this? I must not be trifled with: and I demand an answer. If I have no ties and no affections, hatred and
                     vice must be my portion; the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall become a thing, of
                     whose existence every one will be ignorant. My vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor; and my virtues will
                     necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel the affections of a sensitive being, and become linked to
                     the chain of existence and events, from which I am now
                     excluded." </p>
             
                 <p>I paused some time to reflect on all
                     he had related, and the various arguments which he had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues which he had
                     displayed on the opening of his existence, and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and
                     scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my calculations:
                     a creature who could exist in the ice caves of the glaciers, and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of
                     inaccessible precipices, was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a long pause of
                     reflection, I concluded that the justice due both to
                     him and my fellow-creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request. Turning to him, therefore, I
                     said—</p>
             
                 <p>"I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever, and every other place in the neighbourhood
                     of man, as soon as I shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile." </p>
             
                 <p>"I swear," he cried, "by the sun, and by the blue sky of
                     Heaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my prayer, while they exist you
                     shall never behold me again. Depart to your home, and commence your labours: I shall watch their progress with
                     unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall appear."</p>
             
                 <p> Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in my sentiments. I saw him descend the
                     mountain with greater speed than the flight of an eagle, and quickly lost him among the undulations of the sea of
                     ice. </p>
             
                 <p>His tale had occupied the whole day; and the sun was upon the verge of the horizon when he departed. I knew that I
                     ought to hasten my descent towards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my heart was heavy, and my steps slow. The labour of
                     winding among the little paths of the mountains, and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced, perplexed me, occupied
                     as I was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced. Night was far advanced, when I came to the
                     half-way resting-place, and seated myself beside the fountain. The stars shone at intervals, as the clouds passed
                     from over them; the dark pines rose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground: it was a scene of wonderful solemnity, and stirred strange
                     thoughts within me. I wept bitterly; and clasping my hands in agony, I exclaimed, "Oh! stars and clouds, and winds, ye are all about to
                     mock me: if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as nought; but if not, depart, depart,
                     and leave me in darkness." </p>
             
                 <p>These were wild and miserable thoughts; but I cannot describe to you how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me, and
                     how I listened to every blast of wind, as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me. </p>
             
                 <p>Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no rest, but returned
                     immediately to Geneva. Even in my own heart I could give no expression to my sensations—they weighed on
                     me with a mountain's weight, and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them. Thus I returned home, and entering
                     the house, presented myself to the family. My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm; but I answered no
                     question, scarcely did I speak. I felt as if I were placed under a ban—as if I had no right to claim their
                     sympathies—as if never more might I enjoy companionship with them. Yet even thus I loved them to
                     adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate myself to my most abhorred task. The prospect of such an
                     occupation made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream; and that thought only had to me
                     the reality of life. </p>
