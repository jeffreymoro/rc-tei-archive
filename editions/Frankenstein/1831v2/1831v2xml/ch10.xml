<item>I
 
  SPENT the following day roaming
 
  through the valley. I stood beside
 
  the sources of the Arveiron,
 
  which take their rise in a glacier,
 
  that with slow pace is advancing
 
  down from the summit of the hills,
 
  to barricade the valley. The abrupt
 
  sides of vast mountains were before
 
  me; the icy wall of the glacier
overhung
 
  me; a few shattered pines were
 
  scattered around; and the solemn
 
  silence of this glorious presence-chamber
 
  of imperial Nature was broken
  only by the brawling waves, or
 
  the fall of some vast fragment,
 
  the thunder sound of the avalanche,
 
  or the cracking, reverberated
  along the mountains, of the accumulated
ice,
 
  which, through the silent working
 
  of immutable laws, was ever and
 
  anon rent and torn, as if it had
 
  been but a plaything in their
  hands. These sublime and magnificent
 
  scenes afforded me the greatest
 
  consolation that I was capable
 
  of receiving. They elevated me
 
  from all littleness of feeling;
 
  and although they did not remove
 
  my grief, they subdued and tranquillized
 
  it. In some degree, also, they
 
  diverted my mind from the thoughts
 
  over which it had brooded for
  the last month. I retired to rest
 
  at night; my slumbers, as it were,
 
  waited on and ministered to by
 
  the assemblance of grand shapes
 
  which I had contemplated during
 
  the day. They congregated round
 
  me; the unstained snowy mountain-top,
the
 
  glittering pinnacle, the pine
  woods, and ragged bare ravine;
the
 
  eagle, soaring amidst the cloud—they
 
  all gathered round me, and bade
 
  me be at peace.</item>
<item>
<p>Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke? All of
soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded
every thought. The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists
hid the summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the
faces of those mighty friends. Still I would penetrate their
misty veil, and seek them in their cloudy retreats. What were
rain and storm to me? My mule was brought to the door, and I
resolved to ascend to the
summit of Montanvert. I remembered the effect that the view
of the tremendous and
ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first
saw it. It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave
wings to the soul, and allowed it to soar from the obscure world
to light and joy. The sight of the awful and majestic in
nature had indeed always the effect of solemnizing my mind, and
causing me to forget the passing cares of life. I determined to go without a
guide, for I was well acquainted with the path, and the
presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the
scene.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short windings, which enable you to
surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain. It is a scene terrifically
desolate. In a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be
perceived, where trees lie broken and
strewed on the ground; some entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning upon
the jutting rocks of the mountain, or transversely upon other trees. The
path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines of snow, down which
stones continually roll from above; one of them is particularly dangerous,
as the slightest sound, such as even speaking in a loud voice, produces a
concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the
speaker. The pines are not tall or
luxuriant, but they are sombre, and add an air of severity to the scene. I
looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers which
ran through it, and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite
mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain poured
from the dark sky, and added to the melancholy impression I received from
the objects around me. Alas! why does man boast of sensibilities superior to
those apparent in the brute; it only renders them more necessary beings.
If our impulses were confined to hunger, thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we
are moved by every wind that blows, and a chance word or scene that that</p>
word may convey to us.

<lg>
<l>
<p>

We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.<lb/>
   We rise; one wand'ring thought pollutes the day.<lb/>
We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,<lb/>
   Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;<lb/>
It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,<lb/>
   The path of its departure still is free.<lb/>
Man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow;<lb/>
   Nought may endure but mutability!</p>
</l>
</lg>
</item>
<item>
<p>It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent.
For some time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice.
A mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains. Presently
a breeze dissipated the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier.
The surface is very uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled
sea, descending low, and interspersed by rifts that sink deep.
The field of ice is almost a league
in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. The opposite
mountain is a bare
perpendicular rock. From the side where I now stood Montanvert
was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league; and above it
rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recess of the
rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. The sea, or rather the vast river of ice, wound
among its dependent mountains, whose aërial summits hung over its
recesses. Their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the
clouds. My heart, which was before sorrowful, now swelled with something
like joy; I exclaimed—"Wandering
spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds, allow
me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion, away from the joys
of life."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>As I said this, I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,
advancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the crevices
in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his stature, also, as
he approached, seemed to exceed that of man. I was troubled: a mist came
over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me; but I was quickly restored
by the cold gale of the mountains. I perceived, as the shape came nearer,
(sight tremendous and abhorred!) that
it was the wretch whom I had
created. I trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait his approach,
and then close with him in mortal combat. He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter
anguish, combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly
ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely
observed this; rage and hatred had at
first deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to overwhelm him with
words expressive of furious detestation and contempt.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Devil!" I exclaimed, "do you dare
approach me? and do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on
your miserable head?Begone, vile insect! or rather stay,
that I may trample you to dust! and, oh! that I could, with the extinction
of your miserable existence, restore those victims whom you have so
diabolically murdered!"</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I expected this reception," said the dæmon. "All men hate the wretched; how, then, must I be
hated, who am miserable beyond all
living things! Yet you, my
creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the
annihilation of one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life? Do your duty towards me, and I will do
mine towards you and the rest of mankind. If you will comply with my
conditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, I will
glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your
remaining friends."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Abhorred monster! fiend that thou art! the tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes. Wretched devil! you reproach me with your
creation; come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I so
negligently bestowed."<lb/> My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him,
impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being against the existence
of another.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>He easily eluded me, and said—
</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Be calm! I entreat you to hear me, before you give vent to your hatred on
my devoted head. Have I not suffered
enough, that you seek to increase my misery? Life, although it may only be
an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it. Remember,
thou hast made me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to
thine; my joints more supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee. I am
thy creature, and I will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and
king, if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me. Oh,
Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other, and trample upon me alone,
to whom thy justice, and even thy
clemency and affection, is most due. Remember, that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy Adam; but I am rather
the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed. Every where I
see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy,
and I shall again be virtuous."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Begone! I will not hear you. There can
be no community between you and me; we are enemies. Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight, in which
one must fall."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"How can I move thee? Will no
entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature, who
implores thy goodness and compassion? Believe me, Frankenstein: I was benevolent; my soul glowed with
love and humanity: but am I not alone, miserably alone? You, my
creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow-creatures, who
owe me nothing? they spurn and hate me. The desert mountains and dreary glaciers
are my refuge. I have wandered here many days; the caves of ice, which I
only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the only one which man does
not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they are kinder to me than your
fellow-beings. If the multitude of
mankind knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm
themselves for my destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me? I will keep no terms with my enemies.
I am miserable, and they shall share my
wretchedness. Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver
them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that not only you and your family, but
thousands of others, shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage.
Let your compassion be moved, and do not disdain me. Listen to my tale:
when you have heard that, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge
that I deserve. But hear me. The guilty
are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they are, to speak in their own
defence before they are condemned. Listen to me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of murder; and yet you
would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise
the eternal justice of man! Yet I ask you not to spare me: listen to me;
and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Why do you call to my remembrance," I rejoined, "circumstances, of which
I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and author?
Cursed be the day, abhorred devil,
in which you first saw light! Cursed
(although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you! You have made me wretched beyond
expression. You have left me no
power to consider whether I am just to you, or not. Begone! relieve me
from the sight of your detested form."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Thus I relieve thee, my creator,"
he said, and placed his hated hands before my eyes, which I flung from me
with violence;  "thus I take from thee a sight which you abhor. Still thou
canst listen to me, and grant me thy
compassion. By the virtues that I
once possessed, I demand this from you. Hear my tale; it is long and
strange, and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine
sensations; come to the hut upon the
mountain. The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends to hide
itself behind yon snowy precipices, and illuminate another world, you will
have heard my story, and can decide. On you it rests, whether I quit
forever the neighbourhood of man, and lead a harmless life, or become the
scourge of your fellow-creatures, and the author of your own speedy
ruin."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>As he said this, he led the way across the ice: I followed.
My heart was full, and I did not answer him; but, as I proceeded, I
weighed the various arguments that he had used, and determined at
least to listen to his tale. I was partly urged by
curiosity, and
compassion confirmed my resolution. I had hitherto supposed him
to be the murderer of my brother, and I eagerly sought a
confirmation or denial of this opinion. For the first time, also,
I felt what the duties of a creator towards his
creature were,
and that I ought to render him happy before I complained of his
wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with his demand. We
crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite rock. The
air was cold, and the rain again began to descend: we entered the
hut, the fiend with an air of
exultation, I with a heavy heart, and depressed spirits. But I
consented to listen; and, seating myself by the fire which my odious
companion had lighted, he thus
began his tale.</p>
