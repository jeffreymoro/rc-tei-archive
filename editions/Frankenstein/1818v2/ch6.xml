<head>TEXTS : 1818 EDITION : VOL. II</head>
<p rend="emph">Chapter 6</p>
<p> </p>
<list type="simple">
<item>
<p>"SOME time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends. It was one which could not
									fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding as it did a number of circumstances each interesting and
									wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as I was.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"The name of the old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a good family in France, where
									he had lived for many years in affluence, respected by his superiors, and beloved by his equals. His son was bred in the service of his country; and
									Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction. A few months before my arrival, they had lived in a
									large and luxurious city, called Paris, surrounded by friends, and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue,
									refinement of intellect, or taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin. He was a Turkish merchant, and had
									inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some reason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government. He was seized and cast
									into prison the very day that Safie arrived from
										Constantinople to join him. He was tried, and
										condemned to death. The injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant; and it was
									judged that his religion and wealth, rather than the crime alleged against him, had been the cause of his
									condemnation.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> "Felix had been present at the trial; his horror and indignation were
									uncontrollable, when he heard the decision of the court. He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him, and then looked around for
									the means. After many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an
									unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate Mahometan; who, loaded with chains,
									waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence. Felix visited the grate at night, and made known to the
									prisoner his intentions in his favour. The Turk, amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his
									deliverer by promises of reward and wealth. Felix rejected his offers with contempt; yet when he saw the lovely
									Safie, who was allowed to visit her father, and who, by her gestures, expressed her lively gratitude, the youth
									could not help owning to his own mind, that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and
									hazard.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of
									Felix, and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage, so
									soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety. Felix was too delicate to accept this offer; yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to
									that consummation of his happiness.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the
									merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means
									to express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man, a servant of her father's, who
									understood French. She thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her father; and at
									the same time deeply deplored her own fate.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> "I have copies of these letters; for I found means, during my residence in
									the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha.
									Before I depart, I will give them to you, they will
										prove the truth of my tale; but at present, as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to
									repeat the substance of them to you.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Safie related, that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a slave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty,
									she had won the heart of the father of Safie, who married her. The young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms
									of her mother, who, born in freedom spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced. She instructed her daughter in the tenets of her
										religion, and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect, and an independence of spirit, forbidden to the female followers of Mahomet. This
									lady died; but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again
									returning to Asia, and the being immured within the walls of a haram, allowed only to occupy herself with puerile
									amusements, ill suited to the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue.
									The prospect of marrying a Christian, and remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in society, was
									enchanting to her.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed; but, on the night previous to it, he had
									quitted prison, and before morning was distant many leagues from Paris. Felix had procured passports in the name
									of his father, sister, and himself. He had previously communicated his plan to the former, who aided the deceit by
									quitting his house, under the pretence of a journey, and concealed himself, with his daughter, in an obscure part
									of Paris.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> "Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons, and across Mont Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a
									favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure, before which
									time the Turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in
									expectation of that event; and in the mean time he enjoyed the society of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him
									the simplest and tenderest affection. They conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter, and
									sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place, and encouraged the hopes of the youthful
									lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other plans. He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a Christian; but he
									feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear lukewarm; for he knew that he was still in the power of his
									deliverer, if he should choose to betray him to the
										Italian state which they inhabited. He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong
									the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed. His
									plans were greatly facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> "The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim, and spared
									no pains to detect and punish his deliverer. The plot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha
									were thrown into prison. The news reached Felix, and roused him from his dream of pleasure. His blind and aged
									father, and his gentle sister, lay in a noisome dungeon, while he enjoyed the free air, and the society of her
									whom he loved. This idea was torture to him. He quickly arranged with the Turk, that if the latter should find a
									favourable opportunity for escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a boarder at a
									convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian, he hastened to Paris, and delivered himself up to the
									vengeance of the law, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"He did not succeed. They remained confined for five months before the trial took place; the result of which deprived
									them of their fortune, and condemned them to a perpetual
										exile from their native country.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I discovered them. Felix
									soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on
									discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and impotence, became a traitor to good feeling and
									honour, and had quitted Italy with his daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him, as he
									said, in some plan of future maintenance.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix, and rendered him, when I first saw
									him, the most miserable of his family. He could have endured poverty, and when this distress had been the meed of
									his virtue, he would have gloried in it: but the ingratitude of the Turk, and the loss of his beloved Safie, were
									misfortunes more bitter and irreparable. The arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> "When the news reached Leghorn, that Felix was deprived of his wealth and rank, the merchant
									commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover, but to prepare to return with him to her native country. The
									generous nature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to expostulate with her father, but he left
									her angrily, reiterating his tyrannical mandate.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter's apartment, and told her hastily, that he
									had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn had been divulged, and that he should speedily be delivered up
									to the French government; he had, consequently, hired a vessel to convey him to Constantinople, for which city he
									should sail in a few hours. He intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant, to follow
									at her leisure with the greater part of his property,
									which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would become her to
									pursue in this emergency. A residence in Turkey was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike
									adverse to it. By some papers of her father's, which fell into her hands, she heard of the exile of her lover, and
									learnt the name of the spot where he then resided. She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her
									determination. Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her, and a small sum of money, she quitted Italy, with
									an attendant, a native of Leghorn, but who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for Germany.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage of De Lacey, when
									her attendant fell dangerously ill. Safie nursed her
									with the most devoted affection; but the poor girl
									died, and the Arabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country, and utterly ignorant of
									the customs of the world. She fell, however, into good hands. The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for
									which they were bound; and, after her death, the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that Safie
									should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover.</p>
