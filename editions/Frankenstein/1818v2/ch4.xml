<p rend="emph">Chapter 4</p>
<p> </p>
<list type="simple">
<item>
<p> "I LAY on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the occurrences of
									the day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people; and I longed to join them, but dared not.
									I remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, and resolved,
									whatever course of conduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would remain quietly in my hovel, watching, and
									endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. The young woman arranged the
									cottage, and prepared the food; and the youth departed after the first meal.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it. The young man was
									constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in various laborious occupations within. The old man, whom I soon
									perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument, or in contemplation. Nothing could exceed the
										love and respect which the younger cottagers
									exhibited towards their venerable companion. They performed towards him every little office of affection and duty
									with gentleness; and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> "They were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion often went
									apart, and appeared to weep. I saw no cause for their unhappiness; but I was deeply affected by it. If such lovely creatures were miserable, it was less
									strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being,
									should be wretched. Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? They possessed a delightful house (for such it was
									in my eyes), and every luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill, and delicious viands when hungry; they
									were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more, they enjoyed one another's company and speech, interchanging
									each day looks of affection and kindness. What did their
										tears imply? Did they really express pain? I was at first unable to solve these questions; but perpetual
									attention, and time, explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of the uneasiness of
									this amiable family; it was poverty; and they
									suffered that evil in a very distressing degree. Their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their
									garden, and the milk of one cow, who gave very little during the winter, when its masters could scarcely procure
									food to support it. They often, I believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two
									younger cottagers; for several times they placed food before the old man, when they reserved none for
								themselves.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"This trait of kindness moved
									me sensibly. I had been accustomed, during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own consumption; but
									when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I abstained, and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and roots, which I gathered from a
									neighbouring wood.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> "I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist
									their labours. I found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire; and,
									during the night, I often took his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home firing
									sufficient for the consumption of several days.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she opened the door in
									the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in
									a loud voice, and the youth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure, that he did not go
									to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the cottage, and cultivating the garden.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that these people possessed
									a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the
									words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and countenances of the
									hearers. This was indeed a godlike science, and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it.
									But I was baffled in every attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick; and the words they
									uttered, not having any apparent connexion with visible objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I
									could unravel the mystery of their reference. By great application, however, and after having remained during the
									space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel,
										I discovered the names that were given to some of
									the most familiar objects of discourse; I learned and applied the words fire, milk, bread,
									and wood. I learned also the names of the
										cottagers themselves. The youth and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only
									one, which was father. The girl was called sister, or Agatha; and the youth Felix,
										brother, or son. I cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to
									each of these sounds, and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished several other words, without being able as
									yet to understand or apply them; such as good,
										dearest, unhappy.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> "I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of the
									cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathized in their joys. I saw few human beings
									beside them; and if any other happened to enter the cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me
									the superior accomplishments of my friends. The old man, I could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage his
									children, as sometimes I found that he called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a cheerful
									accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes
									sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I generally found that her
									countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus with
									Felix. He was always the saddest of the groupe; and, even to my unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered
									more deeply than his friends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful than that of
									his sister, especially when he addressed the old man.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I could mention innumerable instances, which, although slight, marked the dispositions of
									these amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty and want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from
									beneath the snowy ground. Early in the morning before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that obstructed her
									path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and brought the wood from the out-house, where, to his perpetual
									astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand. In the day, I believe, he worked
									sometimes for a neighbouring farmer, because he often went forth, and did not return until dinner, yet brought no
									wood with him. At other times he worked in the garden; but, as there was little to do in the frosty season, he
									read to the old man and Agatha.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> "This reading had puzzled me extremely at first; but, by degrees, I
									discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked. I conjectured, therefore, that
									he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend these also; but
									how was that possible, when I did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs? I improved,
									however, sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation, although I applied
									my whole mind to the endeavour: for I easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the
									cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become master of their language; which knowledge
									might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure; for with this also the contrast perpetually
									presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty, and
									delicate complexions: but how was I terrified, when I viewed myself in a transparent pool! At first I started back, unable
									to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was
									filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification. Alas! I did not yet entirely know the fatal
									effects of this miserable deformity.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"As the sun became warmer, and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and I beheld the
									bare trees and the black earth. From this time Felix was more employed; and the heart-moving indications of
									impending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards found, was coarse, but it was wholesome; and they
									procured a sufficiency of it. Several new kinds of plants sprung up in the garden, which they dressed; and these signs of comfort increased
									daily as the season advanced.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> "The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did not
									rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters. This frequently took place; but a high wind quickly
									dried the earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I attended the motions of
									the cottagers; and when they were dispersed in various occupations, I slept: the remainder of the day was spent in
									observing my friends. When they had retired to rest, if there was any moon, or the night was star-light, I went
									into the woods, and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it was necessary,
									I cleared their path of the snow, and performed those offices that I had seen done by Felix. I afterwards found
									that these labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and once or twice I heard them, on
									these occasions, utter the words good spirit, wonderful; but I did not then understand the signification of these terms.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the motives and feelings of
									these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to know why Felix appeared so miserable, and Agatha so sad. I thought
									(foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people. When I slept, or
									was absent, the forms of the venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix, flitted before
									me. I looked upon them as superior beings, who would be the arbiters of my future destiny. I formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting
									myself to them, and their reception of me. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour
									and conciliating words, I should first win their favour, and afterwards their love.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> "These thoughts exhilarated me, and led me to apply with fresh ardour to
									the acquiring the art of language. My organs were
									indeed harsh, but supple: and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I pronounced
									such words as I understood with tolerable ease. It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate, although his
									manners were rude, deserved better treatment than
									blows and execration.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth.
									Men, who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves, dispersed themselves, and were employed in various
									arts of cultivation. The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees. Happy,
									happy earth! fit habitation for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome. My spirits
									were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature;
									the past was blotted from my memory, the present was
									tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of hope, and anticipations of joy.</p>
