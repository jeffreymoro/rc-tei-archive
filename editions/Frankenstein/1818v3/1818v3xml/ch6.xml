<head>TEXTS : 1818 EDITION : VOL. III</head>
<p rend="emph">Chapter 6</p>
<p> </p>
<list type="simple">
<item>
<p> IT was eight o'clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the
									shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn, and contemplated the lovely scene of waters,
									woods, and mountains, obscured in darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence in the west. The moon
									had reached her summit in the heavens, and was beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the
									flight of the vulture, and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens, rendered still
									busier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise. Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I had been calm during the day; but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects, a
									thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden
									in my bosom; every sound terrified me; but I resolved that I would sell my life dearly, and not relax the
									impending conflict until my own life, or that of my
										adversary, were extinguished.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence; at length she
									said, "What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor? What is it you fear?"</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Oh! peace, peace, my love," replied I, "this night, and all will be safe: but this night
									is dreadful, very dreadful."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how dreadful the combat
									which I momentarily expected would be to my wife, and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join
									her until I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages of
									the house, and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to my adversary. But I discovered no trace of
									him, and was beginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his
									menaces; when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful scream. It came from the room into which Elizabeth had
									retired. As I heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could
										feel the blood trickling in my veins, and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This state lasted but
									for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed into the room.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Great God! why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the destruction of the best
									hope, and the purest creature of earth. She was there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head
									hanging down, and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Everywhere I turn I see the same
									figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold
									this, and live? Alas! life is obstinate, and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment only did I lose
									recollection; I fainted.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>When I recovered, I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their countenances
									expressed a breathless terror: but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that
									oppressed me. I escaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my wife, so lately living,
									so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld her; and now, as she lay, her
									head upon her arm, and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have supposed her asleep. I rushed
									towards her, and embraced her with ardour; but the
									deathly languor and coldness of the limbs told me, that what I now held in my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth
									whom I had loved and cherished. The murderous mark of the fiend's grasp was on her neck, and the breath had ceased
									to issue from her lips.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.
									The windows of the room had before been darkened; and I felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of
									the moon illuminate the chamber. The shutters had been thrown back; and, with a sensation of horror not to be
									described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred. A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to
									jeer, as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards the window, and
									drawing a pistol from my bosom, shot; but he eluded me, leaped from his station, and, running with the swiftness
									of lightning, plunged into the lake.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to the spot where he had
									disappeared, and we followed the track with boats; nets were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, we
									returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a form conjured by my fancy. After having
									landed, they proceeded to search the country, parties going in different directions among the woods and vines.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I did not accompany them; I was exhausted: a film covered my eyes, and my skin was parched
									with the heat of fever. In this state I lay on a bed,
									hardly conscious of what had happened; my eyes wandered round the room, as if to seek something that I had
								lost.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>At length I remembered that my father would anxiously expect the return of Elizabeth and
									myself, and that I must return alone. This reflection brought tears into my eyes, and I wept for a long time; but
									my thoughts rambled to various subjects, reflecting on my
										misfortunes, and their cause. I was bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death of William, the
									execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only
									remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now might be writhing under his grasp,
									and Ernest might be dead at his feet. This idea made me shudder, and recalled me to action. I started up, and
									resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in
									torrents. However, it was hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men to row, and
									took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from mental torment in bodily exercise. But the
									overflowing misery I now felt, and the excess of agitation that I endured, rendered me incapable of any exertion.
									I threw down the oar; and, leaning my head upon my hands, gave way to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked
									up, I saw the scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time, and which I had contemplated but the day before
									in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection. Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain had
									ceased for a moment, and I saw the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had then been
									observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change. The sun might shine,
									or the clouds might lour; but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had snatched from
									me every hope of future happiness: no creature had ever
										been so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of man.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event. Mine
									has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their acme, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to
									you. Know that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My own strength is exhausted; and
									I must tell, in a few words, what remains of my hideous
										narration.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived; but the former sunk under the
									tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old man! his eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had
									lost their charm and their delight—his niece, his more than daughter, whom he doated on with all that affection which a man feels, who, in the decline
									of life, having few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed be the fiend that
									brought misery on his grey hairs, and doomed him to waste in wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors
									that were accumulated around him; an apoplectic fit
									was brought on, and in a few days he died in my arms.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and darkness were the only
									objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes, indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales
									with the friends of my youth; but awoke, and found myself in a dungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I
									gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation, and was then released from my prison. For they had called me mad; and during many months, as I
									understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>But liberty had been a useless
										gift to me had I not, as I awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. As the memory of past
									misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their cause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable
									daemon whom I had sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired
									and ardently prayed that I might have him within my
									grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect
									on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town, and told him that I
									had an accusation to make; that I knew the destroyer of my family; and that I required him to exert his whole
									authority for the apprehension of the murderer.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness: "Be assured, sir," said he, "no
									pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I thank you," replied I; "listen, therefore, to the deposition that I have to make. It is
									indeed a tale so strange, that I should fear you would not credit it, were there not something in truth which,
									however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too
										connected to be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood." My manner, as I thus addressed
									him, was impressive, but calm; I had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death; and this
									purpose quieted my agony, and provisionally reconciled me to life. I now related my history briefly, but with
									firmness and precision, marking the dates with accuracy, and never deviating into invective or exclamation.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he became more
									attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror, at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted on his
									countenance.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>When I had concluded my narration, I said, "This is the being whom I accuse, and for whose
									detection and punishment I call upon you to exert your whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and
									hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my
									auditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of
										belief that is given to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon to act
									officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity returned. He, however, answered mildly, "I would
									willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit; but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which
									would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice, and inhabit
									caves and dens, where no man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since the commission of
									his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered, or what region he may now inhabit."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit; and if he has indeed taken
									refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois, and destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your
									thoughts: you do not credit my narrative, and do not
									intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated; "You are mistaken,"
									said he, "I will exert myself; if it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer
									punishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have yourself described to be his properties,
									that this will prove impracticable, and that, while every proper measure is pursued, you should endeavour to make up your mind to
										disappointment."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> "That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My revenge
									is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage
									is unspeakable, when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned loose upon society, still exists. You refuse
									my just demand: I have but one resource; and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to his destruction."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a phrenzy in my manner, and
									something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness, which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan magistrate, whose mind was occupied by
									far other ideas than those of devotion and heroism, this
										elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child,
									and reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Man," I cried, "how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom! Cease; you know not what it
									is you say."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I broke from the house angry and disturbed, and retired to meditate on some other mode of
									action.</p>
