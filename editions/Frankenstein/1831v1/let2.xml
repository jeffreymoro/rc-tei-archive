<p rend="emph">Letter II</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To Mrs. SAVILLE, England.</p>
<p> Archangel, 28th March, 17--.</p>
<list type="simple">
<item>
<p> How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow! yet a second
										step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a vessel, and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those
										whom I have already engaged, appear to be men on whom I
											can depend, and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p> But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy; and the absence of the object of which I now feel
									as a most severe evil. I have no friend, Margaret:
									when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there
									will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in
									dejection. I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling. I desire the company of a
									man who could sympathize with me; whose eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the
									want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a
									capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a friend repair the
									faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent  in
									execution, and too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my
									life I ran wild on a common, and read nothing but our
									uncle Thomas's books of voyages. At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country; but
									it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction,
									that I perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted
										with more languages  than that of my native country. Now I am twenty-eight, and am in reality more illiterate
									than many schoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more, and that my day dreams  are more extended and magnificent; but
									they want (as the painters call it) keeping; and I greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough
									for me to endeavour to regulate my mind.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among
									merchants and seamen. Yet some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms.
									My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage  and enterprise; he is madly
									desirous of glory: or rather, to word my phrase more
									characteristically, of advancement in his profession.
									He is an Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains
									some of the noblest endowments of humanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel: finding
									that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>The master is a person of an excellent disposition, and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This
									circumstance, added to his well known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very desirous to engage him. A
									youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under your
										gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character, that I cannot overcome an
									intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on
									board ship: I have never believed it to be necessary; and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his
									kindliness of heart, and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in
									being able to secure his services. I heard of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him
									the happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady, of moderate
									fortune; and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw his mistress once before the destined
									ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and, throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing
									at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never consent to the
									union. My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover, instantly
									abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder
									of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase
									stock, and then himself solicited the young woman's father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old
									man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend; who, when he found the father inexorable,
									quitted his country, nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her
									inclinations. "What a noble fellow!" you will exclaim.
									He is so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct
									the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little, or because I can conceive a consolation for my toils which I may
									never know, that I am wavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate; and my voyage is only now delayed until
									the weather shall permit my embarkation. The winter has been dreadfully severe; but the spring promises well, and
									it is considered as a remarkably early season; so that, perhaps, I may sail sooner than I expected. I shall do
									nothing rashly; you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking. It is
									impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with
									which I am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to "the land of mist and snow;" but I shall kill no
									albatross, therefore do not be alarmed for my safety, or if I should come back to you as worn and woful as the
									"Ancient Mariner?" You will smile at my allusion; but I will disclose a secret. I have often attributed my
									attachment to, my passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of the ocean, to that production of the most
									imaginative of modern poets. There is something at work in my soul, which I do not understand. I am practically
									industrious—pains-taking;—a workman to execute with perseverance and labour:—but
									besides this, there is a love for the marvellous, a belief in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects,
									which hurries me out of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited regions I am about to
									explore. But to return to dearer considerations. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Shall I meet you again, after having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of Africa or America? I dare
									not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to
									write to me by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when I need them most to support my
									spirits. I love you very tenderly. Remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again. </p> Your
								affectionate brother, <p>ROBERT WALTON. </p>
