<p>
 WE passed a few sad hours, until eleven o'clock, when the trial was to commence.
 My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses, I
 accompanied them to the court. During the whole of this wretched mockery
 of justice  I suffered living torture. It
 was to be decided, whether the result of my curiosity  and lawless
 devices  would cause the death of two of my fellow-beings: one a smiling
 babe, full of innocence and joy; the other far more dreadfully murdered, with
 every aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.
 Justine also was a girl of merit, andpossessed qualities which promised to render
 her life happy: now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave; and I
 the cause!  A thousand times rather would I have confessed myself guilty
 of the crime ascribed to Justine; but I was absent when it was committed, and
 such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings
 of a madman, and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>The
     appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning; and her countenance,
     always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her feelings, exquisitely
     beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in innocence, and did not tremble, although gazed
       on and execrated  by thousands; for all the kindness which her beauty
       might otherwise have excited, was obliterated in the minds of the spectators
       by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She
       was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her
       confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up
       her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the court, she threw
       her eyes round it, and quickly discovered where we were seated. A tear seemed
       to dim her eye when she saw us; but she quickly recovered herself, and a
       look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>The trial began; and, after the advocate against her had stated the
          charge, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined
          against her, which might have staggered any one who had not such
          proof  of her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of
          the night on which the murder had been committed, and towards morning
          had been perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the
          body of the murdered child had been afterwards found. The woman asked
          her what she did there; but she looked very strangely, and only returned
          a confused
          and unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight
          o'clock; and, when one inquired where she had passed the night,
          she replied, that she had been looking for the child, and demanded
          earnestly if any thing had been heard concerning him. When shown the
          body, she fell into violent hysterics, and kept her bed for several
          days. The picture was then produced, which the servant had found in
          her pocket; and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it
          was the same which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had
          placed round his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the
          court. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded,
          her countenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly
          expressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears; but, when she was
          desired to plead, she collected her powers, and spoke in an audible,
          although variable voice. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p> "God knows," she said, "how entirely I am innocent. But I do not
          pretend that my protestations should acquit me: I rest my innocence
          on a plain
          and simple explanation of the facts  which have been adduced against
          me; and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my judges
          to a favourable interpretation, where any circumstance appears doubtful
          or suspicious." </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed
          the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at
          the house of an aunt at Chêne, a village situated at about a league  from
          Geneva. On her return, at about nine o'clock, she met a man, who asked
          her if she had seen any thing of the child who was lost. She was alarmed
          by this account, and passed several hours in looking for him, when
          the gates
          of Geneva  were shut, and she was forced to remain several hours
          of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call
          up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known. Most of the night she
          spent here watching; towards morning she believed that she slept for
          a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke. It was dawn,
          and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour to find
          my brother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay, it was
          without her knowledge. That she had been bewildered when questioned
          by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed a sleepless
          night, and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain. Concerning the
          picture she could give no account. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I know," continued the unhappy victim, "how heavily and fatally
          this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of explaining
          it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left to
          conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been
          placed in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I
          have no enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked
          as to destroy me wantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know
          of no opportunity afforded him  for
          so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the jewel, to
          part with it again so soon? </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room
          for hope. I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning
          my character; and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed
          guilt, I must be condemned, although I
          would pledge my salvation  on my innocence." </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Several witnesses were called, who had known her for many years,
          and they spoke well of her; but fear, and hatred of the crime of which
          they supposed her guilty, rendered them timorous, and unwilling to
          come forward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent
          dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,
          when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address
          the court. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I am," said she, "the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered,
          or rather his sister, for I was educated by, and have lived with his
          parents ever since and even long before, his birth. It may therefore
          be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion; but when
          I see a fellow-creature about to perish through the cowardice of her
          pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what
          I know of her character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have
          lived in the same house with her, at
          one time for five, and at another for nearly two years. During
          all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent
          of human creatures. She
          nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last illness, with
          the greatest affection and care; and afterwards attended her own mother
          during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited the admiration of
          all who knew her; after which she again lived in my uncle's house,
          where she was beloved by all the family. She was warmly attached to
          the child who is now dead, and acted towards him like a most affectionate
          mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say, that, notwithstanding
          all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect
          innocence. She had no temptation for such an action: as to the bauble  on
          which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it, I should
          have willingly given it to her; so much do I esteem and value her." </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth's simple and powerful appeal;
      but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in favor of poor
      Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence,
      charging her with the blackest
      ingratitude. She herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not
      answer. My own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial.
      I believed in her innocence; I knew it. Could the dæmon,
      who had (I did not for a minute doubt) murdered my brother, also in his
      hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy? I could
      not sustain the horror of my situation; and when I perceived that the popular
      voice, and the countenances of the judges, had already condemned my unhappy
      victim, I rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures
      of the accused  did not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence,
      but the fangs
      of remorse  tore my bosom, and would not forego their hold. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to
      the court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal question;
      but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my visit. The ballots  had
      been thrown; they were all black, and Justine was condemned. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before experienced
      sensations of horror; and I
      have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions, but words
      cannot convey an idea of the heart-sickening despair that I then endured.
      The person to whom I addressed myself added, that Justine had already confessed
      her guilt. "That evidence," he observed, "was hardly required in so
      glaring a case, but I am glad of it; and, indeed, none of our judges like
    to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so decisive." </p>
</item>
<item>
<p> This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? Had
      my eyes deceived me? and was I really as mad as the whole world would believe
      me to be, if I disclosed the object of my suspicions? I hastened to return
      home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"My cousin," replied I, "it is decided as you may have expected; all
        judges  had rather that ten innocent should suffer, than that one
        guilty should escape. But she has confessed." </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness
      upon Justine's innocence. "Alas!" said she, "how shall I ever again believe
      in human
      goodness? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my sister, how could
      she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray? Her mild eyes seemed
      incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has committed a murder." </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see
      my cousin. My
      father wished her not to go; but said, that he left it to her own
      judgment and feelings to decide. "Yes," said Elizabeth, "I will go, although
      she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany me: I cannot go alone." The
      idea of this visit was torture to me, yet I could not refuse. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>We entered the gloomy prison-chamber, and beheld Justine sitting on some
      straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested
      on her knees. She rose on seeing us enter; and when we were left alone
      with her, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly.
      My cousin wept also. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p> "Oh, Justine!" said she, "why did you rob me of my last consolation?
      I relied on your innocence; and although I was then very wretched, I was
    not so miserable as I am now." </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also join
        with my enemies  to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?" Her voice
        was suffocated with sobs. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Rise, my poor girl," said Elizabeth, "why do you kneel, if you are innocent?
      I am not one of your enemies; I believed you guiltless, notwithstanding
      every evidence, until I heard that you had yourself declared your guilt.
      That report, you say, is false; and be assured, dear Justine, that nothing
      can shake my confidence in you for a moment, but your own confession." </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I did confess; but I confessed a lie. I
        confessed, that I might obtain absolution; but now that falsehood
        lies heavier at my heart than all my other sins. The God of heaven forgive
        me! Ever since I was condemned, my
        confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced, until I almost
        began to think that I
        was the monster  that he said I was. He threatened excommunication
        and hell fire in my last moments, if I continued obdurate. Dear lady,
        I had none to support me; all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy
        and perdition. What could I do? In an evil hour I
        subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly miserable." </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>She paused, weeping, and then continued—"I thought with horror, my
      sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed aunt
      had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable of a
      crime which none
      but the devil  himself could have perpetrated. Dear William! dearest
      blessed child! I soon shall see you again in heaven, where we shall all
    be happy; and that consoles me, going as I am to suffer ignominy and death." </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Oh, Justine! forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you. Why
      did you confess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not fear. I will proclaim,
      I will prove your innocence. I will melt the stony hearts of your enemies
      by my tears and prayers. You shall not die!—You, my play-fellow, my
      companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold! No! no! I never could survive
      so horrible a misfortune." </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Justine shook her head mournfully. "I do not fear to die," she said; "that
      pang is past. God
      raises my weakness, and gives me courage to endure the worst. I leave
      a sad and bitter world; and if you remember me, and think of me as of one
      unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the fate awaiting me. Learn from me,
    dear lady, to submit in patience to the will of Heaven!"</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>During this conversation I
        had retired to a corner of the prison-room, where I could conceal
        the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair! Who dared talked of that?
        The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between
        life and death, felt
        not as I did, such deep and bitter agony. I
        gnashed my teeth, and ground them together, uttering a groan that
        came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When she saw who it was, she
        approached me, and said, "Dear sir, you are very kind to visit me; you,
        I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?" </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I could not answer. "No, Justine," said Elizabeth; "he is more convinced
      of your innocence than I was; for even when he heard that you had confessed,
      he did not credit it." </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude
      towards those who think of me with kindness. How
      sweet is the affection of others  to such a
      wretch  as I am! It removes more than half my misfortune; and I feel
      as if I could die in peace, now that my innocence is acknowledged by you,
      dear lady, and your cousin." </p>

<p>Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed
      gained the resignation she desired. But I,
      the true murderer, felt the
      never-dying worm  alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or consolation.
      Elizabeth also wept, and was unhappy; but hers also was the misery of innocence,
      which, like a cloud that passes over the fair moon, for a while hides but
      cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and despair had penetrated into
      the core of my heart; I
      bore a hell within me, which nothing could extinguish. We stayed several
      hours with Justine; and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could
      tear herself away. "I wish," cried she, "that I were to die with you; I
      cannot live in this world of misery." </p>

<p>Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed
      her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth, and said, in a voice of half-suppressed
      emotion, "Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my
      beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and preserve
      you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer. Live, and
      be happy, and make
      others so." </p>

<p>And on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeth's heart-rending
        eloquence  failed to move the judges from their settled conviction
        in the criminality of the saintly sufferer. My passionate and indignant
        appeals were lost upon them. And when I received their cold answers,
        and heard the harsh unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed avowal
        died away on my lips. Thus I might proclaim myself a madman, but not
        revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim. She perished on the
        scaffold as a murderess! </p>

<p>From the tortures of my own heart, I turned
        to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also
        was my doing! And my father's woe, and the desolation of that late so
        smiling home—all was the work of my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep,
        unhappy ones; but these are not your last tears! Again shall you raise
        the funeral wail, and the sound of your lamentations shall again and
        again be heard! Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved
        friend; he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes—who
        has no thought nor sense of joy, except as it is mirrored also in your
        dear countenances—who would fill the air with blessings, and
        spend his life in serving you—he bids you weep—to shed countless
        tears; happy beyond his hopes, if thus inexorable
      fate  be satisfied, and if the destruction pause before the peace of
      the grave have succeeded to your sad torments! </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn
        by remorse, horror, and despair, I beheld those l loved spend vain
        sorrow upon the graves of William and Justine, the first hapless victims
        to my unhallowed arts. </p>
