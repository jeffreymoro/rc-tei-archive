    This would appear to be an "in-joke." This region, of course, in Mary Shelley's day had become associated with the Lake Poets, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey, and was likewise the home of the soon-to-be-famous Thomas De Quincey, who had rented Dove Cottage from Wordsworth in 1809. Percy Shelley and his first wife Harriet had visited the region for several weeks in 1811, where they made the acquaintance of Southey and held long literary and political talks with him of the sort indicated here. This context might be indicated by the fact that it is Clerval in particular who is attracted to the region and his new acquaintance there.

                  <term>actuated by selfish and vicious motives </term>
    
  On the face of it, Victor's honest admission that he has been impelled by less
  than disinterested motives must raise him in the reader's estimation, especially
  since he is close to his death and seems to be struggling for a truthful objectivity.
  Yet, a second glance at this phrase calls for its positioning, and we realize
  that Victor is referring to the last paragraph of his narration (III:7:26),
  uttered on 26 August, not three weeks before. If the last paragraph of his
  account is so indelibly tainted as Victor admits, what are we to think of what
  has preceded it? In other words, by what has his entire narration been "actuated"?
  If the whole rests on nothing but "selfish and vicious motives," then the textual
  indeterminacy so continually hinted at throughout the novel may in fact be
  radical.

    For the third time in these Irish chapters (see III:3:29 and III:4:11) Mary Shelley  emphasizes a multiple perspective associated with shifts in language. To some extent, she must be reinforcing our awareness of an essential affinity between Victor Frankenstein and Mr. Kirwin in matters of class and education. Yet, even as she evokes common bonds, she subtly reminds us of the differences that are lost in translation or that, on a larger scale, represent features by which we distinguish ourselves from others.

                  <term>the affections </term>
    
      In these late frames Victor's ramblings tend to touch on themes represented
      early in the novel and subsequently rather shunted to the side by the pressure
      of events. Thus, Victor's underscoring of the domestic affections as the
      arena for human life's most cherished actions reflects the nostalgic view
      of his childhood expressed in his first chapter (I:1:9, I:1:11)
      and strongly reinforced by his bitter recriminations over his withdrawal
      from this arena at Ingolstadt (I:3:12 and note).
      That the novel's actual focus is rather the opposite has been remarked
      more than once by critics. Certainly, the ultimate value of what on the
      surface appear to be peaceful domestic affections is thrown into question
      by the behavior of the cottagers to the Creature in Volume 2 (II:7:36)
      or the scapegoating of Justine conducted by the pious burghers of Geneva
      in Volume 1 (I:7:13).

                  <term>Again do I vow vengeance </term>
    The sudden time shift into the present tense makes us realize how isolated from reality is Victor's conception of the universe. But, likewise, the religious overtones of this reiterated "vow," combined with Victor's sense that he is an instrument of divine retribution, must alert us to the irony by which the two beings, linked in a closed circle of revenge, are anything but redemptive in their endeavors.

                  <term>my agony was still superior to thine </term>
  The Creature's language recalls the diction of Victor Frankenstein's curse on him in the cemetery of Geneva  where the Frankenstein family was interred (III:7:5), to which he responded with a "loud and fiendish laugh." This retrospective perhaps explicates that laugh; at the very least, it indicates that the agony Victor had wished upon him then was already the abiding condition of his existence.

    The "almost" by which Victor separates himself from moral responsibility contrasts sharply with the strength of his verb emphasizing sheer brutality. This language is commensurate with the burst of passionate violence in which he tore to pieces the second being on whom he had labored (III:3:4).

                  <term>almost as imposing and interesting as truth </term>
    For a person of Walton's scientific pretensions, this is a remarkable phrase. As with other statements in these paragraphs, it bears a poised ambiguity in its significance, both justifying the super-natural as a realm of imaginative vision and casting doubt on its actual efficacy. Truth is, after all, here an unmodifiable standard by which all visionary comparisons are to be judged.

  This image of existential solitude is the final allusion of the many in this novel to Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, "Alone, alone, all, all alone" (line 232).

                  <term>An eye so full of lofty design </term>
    
      Admittedly, the reader will not wish to take such a phrase out of its context,
      nor wholly discount how impressed Walton himself is by his friend's intervention
      on his behalf. Yet at the same time the ambivalence in diction that has
      surrounded the functioning of eloquence since Walton resumed the narration
      (III:Walton:1,
      III:Walton:6 and note, III:Walton:12 and note) calls attention to this further
      instance of the double-entendre. "Design" may
      be a synonym for "purpose," the word Walton stresses just below, at the
      end of this day's entry; but it may also bear a sense of calculated histronics.
      The linguistic ambivalence allows Walton and his readers, should they wish,
      to derive opposite conclusions from the same evidence.

                  <p> The phrase is suggestive of something beyond the mere identification of the
 body. Victor surely recognizes his responsibility for this death. Perhaps the
 extremity of his phrase is also intended to accentuate the point at which he
 finds himself looking, as it were, into a mirror, confronting a second self
 who has been murdered by a being who is likewise an extension of himself. The
 shock, as his reaction strongly testifies, is psychologically as well as physically
 convulsive.</p>

    This description, though clearly conditioned by the rugged and mountainous islands to which Victor has retreated, is even more appropriate to the realm of transgressive power in which his scientific obsessions are centered. Whenever the sublime erupts in Frankenstein, the reader may expect its avatar, Victor's Creature, to make an appearance as well.

    The emphasis on Victor's theatricality in the previous paragraph has insinuated the question of exactly where the truth may lie in Victor's account. Although Walton concentrates on the possibility that Victor's tale could be a complete fabrication, for the reader convinced of the Creature's existence this language also underscores the larger issue of the relativity of any individual's perception of the truth. The Creature's take on this story, as Walton will himself learn, is rather different from Victor's.

    Victor here construes himself in terms of the fallen Adam, by his transgressive actions forever barred from Paradise. The angel whose "arm [is] bared" is the figure Blake  called "the Covering Cherub," assigned to make certain that no return was possible: it is to be assumed that by this figure Victor identifies his Creature as an instrument of divine destiny.

                  <p>Which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hell; <lb/>
    And, in the lowest deep, a lower deep <lb/>

                  <term>They were for ever ardent and craving </term>
  In the connotations of Mary Shelley's time, this phrase, in combination with the "impotent passions" described two sentences earlier, would seem to suggest that the Creature has suffered deeply during his existence from unconsummated sexual desire. Ironically, his desire for intercourse has been pure and unsublimated, whereas that of Walton and Frankenstein has been strongly channeled away from human interaction and into their respective projects (see II:9:9 and note).

               <item>
                  <term>ardent desire </term>
    The resonaces of this phrase for both Victor (see I:2:7),
    his Creature (see II:5:7 and III:Walton:43),
    Walton (I:L3:1),
    and even the beneficent Mr. Kirwin (III:4:20)
    are another indication of how carefully Mary Shelley, in this final chapter
    of Victor's narration, is engaged in marking thematic unities across the
    various levels of her fictional panorama. "Ardent desire," though if untempered
    it can lead to a solipsistic irresponsibilty, is nonetheless an essential
    human principle. Its abrogation here, which will be reinforced by Victor's
    repetition of this disclaimer in his last moments (see III:Walton:28),
    indicates how whole is Victor's reversal from the student who undertook his
    career at Ingolstadt because he so "ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge" (I:2:7).

               <item>
                  <term>Embraced her with ardour </term>
    After the numerous uses of this word to express a passion deflected upon mental objects and self-destructive withdrawal from community (see II:1:6 and its omnibus note), it is almost shocking to have it at last, and ironically, function within its normative connotations: that is to say, to represent passionate love.

               <item>
                  <term>ardently prayed </term>
    The language of ardor, earlier associated with the scientific pursuits of both Walton (I:L1:2, I:L3:1) and Victor Frankenstein (I:3:2, I:4:3)—where in the latter case it is tinged with something approaching the eroticism only fully expressed after the death of Elizabeth (III:6:9)—is here transferred into the arena of hatred. In Victor this hatred will constitute a passion as intense and single-minded as erotic infatuation.
    <p/>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <term>ascertain my fate </term>
    From the retrospect of later chapters in the novel this seemingly innocuous phrase might be seen as constituting something of a floodwater for what will become an increasingly powerful, inescapable driving force in Victor's comprehension of the world. At the conceptual core of this notion of destiny one finds combined, as here, a sense of his own incapacity to act independently, a passivity before what he construes as superior power, and an abnegation of responsibility for the actions of himself or others.

  Victor's assurance of transcendental authorization for his murderous intentions has become so absolute that he never questions his aims or how they are thus assured. Unlike Walton and his crew, he is locked into a vision as rigid and unmoving as had been the icefield surrounding the ship. When it breaks apart, offering an escape to a renewed, living community, Victor chooses to revert to the closed and solitary circle of his vengeance. That decision insures, indeed, is virtually the equivalent of, the death that forestalls his further pursuit of the Creature.

                  <term>assizes </term>
    The Oxford English Dictionary, in its twelfth subsection under the substantive "assize," explains these courts of trial as follows: 
	The sessions held periodically in each county of England, for the purpose of administering civil and criminal justice, by judges acting under certain special commissions (chiefly and usually, but not exclusively, being ordinary judges of the superior courts, or, after 1875, of the Supreme Court). It was provided by Magna Carta that the judges should visit each county once every year to take assizes (i.e. try writs of assize) of novel disseisin, mort d'ancestre, and darreine presentment (so that the jury who constituted the Grand Assize . . . might not be obliged to travel from remote corners of England to appear in court at Westminster). Thence the names assizes, and justices or judges of assize, still retained by these circuit courts and itinerant judges, after their judicial functions had been greatly extended in various directions, especially in that of the trial of felonies and offences. Assizes were abolished by the Courts Act, 1971; their criminal jurisdiction was transferred to the Crown Courts. 
	Of course, Ireland  in the eighteenth-century had not yet been joined administratively to the mechanisms of the United Kingdom as it would become with the Act of Union of 1801. But in practical effect the nominally independent country, in its administration of justice, modeled itself on the English system.

    Victor's hyperbole is characteristic of his imagination, which, whether leading him to create a being of abnormal stature or to envision a succesion of horrific torments he might suffer, is always larger than life. The remark does, however, prepare us for the extraordinary distance he does, indeed, travel.

      The expedition to Mont Blanc took place "about the middle of August" (II:1:10),

    Walton dates the final entry in his previous letter (I:L4:30) to his sister on August 19th, noting that Victor will begin his tale the following day. Thus, Victor's long narrative, which constitutes the bulk of the novel's three volumes and spans many years and all of Europe, has occupied a mere six days of the fictional time frame.

    Victor's regaining a sense of community through the influence of Clerval's letter, as he represented himself three paragraphs earlier, seems far from certain. His shying from contact with his fellow humans has become virtually instinctive. That he refers to the fishermen by the generic term "creatures" is instructive, since it separates them to a marked degree within the same generic category as the being whom he created.

    In the course of two trials and even in his final deposition to a Geneva  magistrate Victor is exonerated from reponsibility for any criminal activity. Thus, this "award" is one that, in Victor's mind, exists beyond the checkered course of human justice. In a fine irony, it is only moments before he narrates the events of a trial from which he easily secures his release that Victor indicates to Walton that he has brought himself to the bar to be condemned.

    The faintly Biblical language in which the Creature speaks is actually derived, and it would seem significantly so, from Milton. The vocabulary reflects the scene in which Adam names the various, already-mated species of animals, then asks God why he should himself be left in solitude. See Paradise Lost 8.389ff.  and 8.594. In context, then, the Creature is telling Victor that he has broken the contract that God had made with Adam.

    At this point it is clear that it is Clerval, "the image of [Victor's] former self" (III:2:3) who retains this responsiveness to his natural surroundings. This is exemplified in the previous chapter with his enthusiastic reaction to the Rhine valley (III:1:19). His citing of both the beautiful and the sublime in this sentence may point the reader less to Victor—who sees himself no longer able to respond fully to either—than to a sense of inclusiveness, at once aesthetic and intellectual, that Mary Shelley  seems to be associating with a fully realized human being.

      The echo of Lady Macbeth's denunciation of her husband's vacillation before the murder of Duncan is unmistakable, and, like the earlier allusion to Inferno  26, provides an ironic subtext that undercuts Victor's histrionic oratory:

That Victor should here repeat that term of distanced scientific taxonomy may give the reader pause.

     The well (or pump-room as it might be called) stands close on the banks of the river, immediately below the Dean Bridge. The water is an excellent sulphureous liquid, possessing the usual medicinal qualities, similar to those of the Moffat, and Harrogate.

This is a major geographical exploration for a man without an expeditionary force. Even more is it an ordeal for his Creature, who leads the way across the wilderness without any human intervention to help or comfort him.

    The language of passion erupts at this point with a startling suddenness, as Victor begins to close with his Creature. That Mary Shelley  expects her readers to sense some measure of perverse, almost abstracted eroticism in this "burning gush" might be inferred from her continual employment of the language of desire throughout the novel (for instance, the various forms of "ardour" and "ardent" she marshals with such skill) and the curious vacuum where one might anticipate passion in the relation of Victor and Elizabeth.

  If it is really true that these striking oxymorons, in which hatred is expressed
  in the language of love, no longer impel Victor, they do reinforce the passionate
  cast of his diction in the last chapters of his narration (III:7:22 and note).
  The word "ardent" likewise reminds us of the use of that word to describe the
  obsessiveness with which he labored to bring his Creature into existence (I:3:1, I:3:9).

    Just nine months before Elizabeth's death Victor, after the discovery of
    Clerval's corpse, had fallen into a delirium lasting two months (III:4:11).
    Even, after he had regained his reason, his ranting convinced his father
    that he remained truly deranged (III:5:5). The constant threading of this issue
    through the novel must remind Mary Shelley's readers that they are wholly
    at the mercy of this autobiographical narrative embedded in her text, a narrative
    told by a man introduced as "generally having an expression of wildness, even madness" to him (I:L4:10). It is more than possible that this is exactly her point, that Victor has been slowly descending into a madness from which there is no escape, and that with his descent the narrative becomes increasingly unreliable.

    Although occuring within a delirium, this is, perhaps, the most open, revelation—even if it is subconscious—of how deeply Victor identifies with the being he created. There would seem, as well, to be a self-awareness of responsibility that, when he is in his senses, Victor represses.

    In a macabre irony Mary Shelley  brings Victor back to the kind of scene with which, as a student in Ingolstadt, he was well familiar, now to contemplate the unlooked-for consequences of his earlier grave-robbing in the destruction of his family. The sudden reappearance of his Creature in such a location—the type, as it were, of the bed on which he was conceived—is perversely appropriate.

  Victor seems to refer to the reasoning that brought him to suspend work on the female companion to his Creature (III:3:1). Yet, this present rearticulation of his thinking revises the terms used earlier, substituting what appears to be a distinction between natural and unnatural life forms, or at least between a majority and minority class, that many readers would find invidious because inherently racist. Again, if this is to be construed as an attempt at honest reassessment, the strained casuistry hints at a slanted self-exoneration.

  With a subtle touch Mary Shelley  emphasizes Walton's similarity to the Victor Frankenstein who, two paragraphs earlier, had been unsure whether he could rid his mind of its "passion," that is, self-interest in its own affairs. The principal cloud overshadowing Walton is the failure of the entire enterprise to which he has been committed for a number of years. The death of Victor has also robbed him of the only deep friendship he has known. On professional and personal planes, then, he is equally bereft.

    Scholars have debated how to construe this addition to the 1831 text of the novel. Given Clerval's seeming representation as a Shelleyan ideal, his desire to attach himself to the imperialist designs of Europe upon Asia would appear to have Mary Shelley's endorsement. And it should be said that this early in the growth of the British empire—long before the Afghan Wars (1839-42) and the Indian Mutiny (1857-59)—when the liberal-minded Sir William Bentinck was Governor-General (1828-35), the British saw their influence in the Indian  subcontinent as morally benign. Still, the extent to which the imperial "native" is debased within this system has its corollary in the rejection of the Creature by Europeans wherever he encounters them. Likewise, earlier imperial projects are roundly condemned elsewhere in the novel: for instance, by Victor  and by the Creature  himself in his reaction to the reading of Volney's Ruins of Empires.

    As with the language with which he earlier speaks of these "remains," Victor's
    skulking hesitation suggests that, however morally blameless he represents
    himself as being, in his deep consciousness he recognizes the similarity
    between his un-creative act and murder. (See III:3:4 and note; III:3:22 and note).

    Indicative either of Victor's own deliberate reinterpretation of the Creature as his double in rewording the "inscriptions" left for him, or of the symbiotic way in which the Creature through the experience of revenge now sounds like a second self of Victor's, this phrase recalls the masculinist bravado Victor twice indulges in his impotent rage before the power of the Creature (see II:2:6 and III:3:16).

    The connotations of this verb, along with the panoply of described emotions surrounding it, forcefully indicate Victor's awareness of the effect he has had on his audience over the previous six days. Walton's language, however, coming immediately upon his assuming what purports to be a narrative objectivity, seems intended to have an even more pronounced effect on the larger audience of Mary Shelley's novel. Where Walton may feel he is experiencing an authentic emotionality, we in our greater detachment may wish instead to discern in Victor's recounted autobiography an accomplished actor's knowing manipulation of his subject matter and his audience.

      In the see-saw effect of her characterization of Victor, Mary Shelley  returns to the side of his character that Walton finds most attractive. In an existential void himself, one created as much by his own chosen withdrawal from social obligations as by the pressure of catastrophic events, Victor is still able to sympathize with the plight of Walton and his crew and to offer encouragement to their hopes. Perhaps what would most easily explain this sympathetic posture, though it would not justify the optimism he expresses to them, is Victor's own deep sense of helplessness before an implacable force.

      These deaths once more testify to the contingent and threatened nature of human life in Frankenstein. The fact of such mortality is surely what exacerbates the crew's sense of its peril and justifies its appeal to the captain to cut short his expedition. Although Walton expresses no guilt for the fate of these mariners under his command, one might wonder at its lack. Certainly, it is an odd paradox that the novel can concentrate with such intensity on the murderous consequences of the antagonism of Victor Frankenstein and his Creature but pass by without comment the revelation that Walton's enterprise in pursuit of knowledge has resulted in apparently greater death than has their destructive dynamic.

  Walton reveals just how much he has learned from listening to Victor's narration, which is to say, how much we have likewise learned from reading the novel. Confronting the Creature with a stern morality but also with compassion, Walton attributes fundamental human characteristics to him, insisting on his humanity and thus on his obligations as a human being. The Creature responds in kind, enumerating even more complexly shaded human attributes as fundamental to his constitution. This process of dynamic self-examination through human interchange may also be seen as a new element in his experience, eliciting a sense of self not as an alienated, and therefore unique and unaccountable, being, but as a sharer in emotions and social duties common to the human race.

                  <term>in continuation </term>
    At this moment of Victor's desparate exhaustion and extreme isolation, Mary Shelley  tellingly reasserts the centrality of human continuity and connectedness. Her sudden reassignment of the role of narrator, from Victor to Walton, also alters its assumed audience. A ship's captain listening to the solitary voice of a dying refugee in the Arctic wilderness shares in that sense of impacted solitude. In contrast, the vicarious experience of Walton's sister, who is addressed directly in the next sentence and who presumably will read this transmitted account in London, takes place at the heart of human civilization. This inserted tag may have a second function as well, that of reinforcing the question posed in the last paragraph of Victor's narrative, whether Walton will honor his plea and continue Victor's obsessive pursuit of the Creature.

                  <term>corrected and augmented </term>
    The question of narrative truth is here given a sudden new twist. As readers over the course of nearly three volumes containing Victor's narrative, we have come to assume that it is a straight-forward account, unmediated by another voice. Now we are forced to recognize that what we have read in this simple understanding has been twice edited, first by Victor, and then by Walton acting at Victor's behest. What Walton first wrote has in its second draft not only been "corrected," but "augmented," added to, leaving us with the uncomfortable feeling that mistakes could still survive in the text, or that they could have been accidentally or—much more worrisome—deliberately introduced in the process of editing, or that further areas for augmentation might still exist that, if properly elaborated, might materially change the focus of our perspective. In other words, Mary Shelley, having just merged two distinct narrative voices and their respective audiences, now further destabilizes her text as an embodiment of a fixed, immutably true account of its personalities and events. Our knowledge is indeterminate and relative, wholly dependent on those voices that filter it.

    A reader cannot miss how without basis is this "reading" of the Creature's facial expression. Victor has neither seen nor spoken to him for an entire year since their encounter on the Sea of Ice. Moreover, throughout the progress of the second volume, in the humanization attendant upon the Creature's autobiographical account, we had gradually lost sight of his objective physical deformity. Here, we are thrust back into an "objectification" that is so extreme that it allows Victor to relinguish all sense of humane obligation or fellow feeling. The self-righteousness that accompanies this distancing is perhaps to be expected.

                  <p> When one examines the chronology of this novel, Victor's inaction or
      procrastination or incapacity, however one denominates it, almost seems
      more its impetus than his earlier obsessiveness. After a six months' illness
      at Ingolstadt, Victor spends an entire year doing almost nothing there
    (I:5:15). Urgently recalled to Geneva by William's
      death, he is stopped for two days when he reaches Lausanne by a sense of
      undefined dread (I:6:14). Although he is certain of Justine's innocence,
      he is incapable of doing anything to support it and watches her trial and
      execution in helpless frustration. There ensues, as the first sentence
      of the second volume indicates, a "dead calmness of inaction and certainty" (II:1:1)
      from which Victor is roused by the expedition to Mont Blanc. In all, this
      trip takes just four days, and he returns from it to his family "passive
      to all their arrangements" (II:9:22). The way in which a sort of psychotic
      trauma wholly blocks the ability to act is likewise a major theme of Byron's Manfred  (1817),
      which also grew out of the Geneva summer of 1816. </p>

  When they were hired on, the crew was specifically described as being "certainly
  possessed of dauntless courage" (I:L2:1).
  It is, of course, possible that Walton was wrong in his original estimation,
  or that the ordeal through which they have passed has sapped the men of their
  bravery. But it is also possible that Walton, driven by an obsession with a
  purpose to which he has devoted years and a small fortune, has misinterpreted
  the caution with which these seamen view the continuance of their mission.
  Twice in his early letters to his sister (I:L2:5, I:L3:3),
  Walton assured her that he would "do nothing rashly." His crew may simply be
  holding him to that promise.

    In this phrase one hears an undertone, faint if ironic, of which Victor is wholly unconscious. There is another "existence" in the novel who is just as wholly dependent "on the life of its creator," though Victor, as here, ignores the imperative posed by his Creature and his own obligations to his creation.

    Although time easily becomes blurred in this novel, the reader should remember that it is actually less than two-and-a-half years since the miscarriage of justice that resulted in Justine Moritz's execution. That Victor, who on that occasion condemned the entire criminal magistracy of Geneva (I:7:14), should now repair to one of them to justify his own murderous pursuit of his Creature underscores the intellectual distance he has traversed in the intervening months, as well as the extremity of his current mental state.

    Cumberland  and Westmoreland  are the counties comprising England's Lake District, at the point of Frankenstein's publication famous for having been the site of a school of distinguished poets, foremost among whom was Wordsworth, who settled at Dove Cottage in Grasmere in 1799. When he transferred a few miles south to the more commodious Rydal Mount a decade after, Thomas DeQuincey moved in to Dove Cottage. In this day the Lake District, as celebrated as it was for its unspoiled natural beauty, was probably the remotest area of England.

                  <term>a mixture of curiosity and compassion </term>
    
  If Victor Frankenstein's dying injunction carries a weight equivalent to that of the law, what suspends Walton's obedience to it are attributes of our human constitution that, for good or for bad, actively resist a rigid legalistic construction. The law, which has persecuted both Justice Moritz in volume 1 and Victor Frankenstein in volume 3, is accorded no special privilege by this novel; but on the other hand curiosity, which has led Walton to endanger the lives of his crew (I:L1:2) and Victor to be blind to the consequences of his scientific obsessions (I:7:1 and note), seems deliberately to have been accorded a bad repute by Mary Shelley. Yet, for the author so to link it with compassion is to suggest an ethical likeness underpinning the two.
  <p> This similarity between sympathy and intellectual inquiry resonates as well in other writings of Mary Shelley and her husband. A central passage  of Percy Bysshe Shelley's "Defence of Poetry" succinctly outlines the dimensions of this similarity and suggests why its terms might matter so deeply to these writers. </p>

               <item>
                  <term>senseless curiosity </term>
    This phrase represents another instance of the complexity of verbal resonance
    we encounter late in Mary Shelley's novel. It was, as Victor Frankenstein
    himself acknowledged, curiosity about the Creature he pursued (I:L4:11)
    that first animated the interest of Walton and his crew. In the very beginning
    Walton had characterized his driving passion as an "ardent curiosity" (I:L1:2),
    and it is this trait that most obviously links him with the obsessive scientific
    pursuits that Victor early on associated with the realm of the "lawless" (I:7:1).
    Yet, it is the same trait that compels Victor to listen to the Creature's
    naration (II:2:16)
    below Mont Blanc and that will restrain Walton from attacking him (III:Walton:38)
    upon his reappearance in the final pages. Thus, what leads to an antisocial
    solipsism can also be an instrument for transcending rigid barriers and reestablishing
    social relationships through sympathy. The strongly oppositional ways in
    which curiosity functions in the novel may suggest that this most human (and
    Romantic) attribute is inherently neither good nor bad, but is merely an
    instrument, neutral in itself, that should never be dissociated from our
    common "sense" of the ends it pursues.

                  <term>I was cursed by some devil, and carried about with me my eternal hell </term>
    To what sort of devil can Victor be referring? Is it what, exonerating himself from responsibility, he described to his father as "some destiny of the most horrible kind" (III:4:41)? Or is it a more immediately relevant sense that the world of the dead, which in the previous paragraphs he has seen as impelling his mission of revenge, has a fundamentally diabolical association (III:7:5)? Or is it that he knows himself to be self-curst, as he earlier surmised at the beginning of the second volume (II:1:1)? Such an admission would involve acknowledging that the "devil" is an internal spirit. Certainly, the continuation of the sentence suggests such a recognition of the diabolical as a psychological state, for it returns us to the conclusion of the first volume, where Victor confesses that upon the execution of Justine Moritz he "bore a hell within [him]" (I:7:30). Once again, the context is supplied by Milton's Satan as he reviews his career in soliloquy on Mt. Niphates (see Paradise Lost, IV.73ff.).

    Such nomenclature has been absent from the novel since early in the second
    chapter (see, for instance, II:2:7):

    lends his Creature a larger-than-life, fantastic presence in his mind and
    in the representation of him.

    Compare with this the stanza quoted from Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner"  to characterize Victor's precipitous walk the morning after the Creature came to life (I:4:7 and  note).

                  <term>deserts and barbarous countries </term>
    As elsewhere in the novel (see III:3:1 and note) and in accord with contemporary usage, "desert" here means any wilderness. In classical references the land of the barbarians is generally construed as Scythia, which is the far interior of Russia. Fittingly, then, it is to that exact geographical region that Victor will pursue the Creature.

               </item>
               <item>
                  <term>deserts </term>
    The term is a generic locution for an area uninhabited by humanity (see II:2:13 and note). Thus, the Creature's plan to seek "the vast wilds of South America" is compatible with this meaning.
    <p> Compare the OED:</p>1. An uninhabited and uncultivated tract of country; a wilderness: . . . b. formerly applied more widely to any wild, uninhabited region, including forest-land. <p>See also Johnson's definition from the Dictionary  of 1755: </p>

  As "design" had an ambiguous sense in its recent application to Victor (III:Walton:18 and note),
  so here the reader is brought short by the Creature's assertion that his series
  of acts have been freely willed. The very adjective he employs embodies an
  internalization of Victor's demonization of him. Although he certainly bears
  responsibility for his acts through an abiding remorse, at the same time we
  are aware that he has been conditioned into the state of the demonic. To adapt
  the logic of his own rhetoric, negated as a human being, he has been recreated
  as a demon by the relentless scapegoating he has suffered.

                  <term>destined for some great enterprise </term>
                  <p>Whether this is seen as an attempt on Victor's part to rewrite his initial
      account, as an overt expression of a megalomania earlier under firmer control,
      or as simply a more commanding perspective on his youthful passion, a comparison
      with the first chapter of his narrative (I:1:18)
      yields no sense of Victor's feeling singled out for accomplishment, but
      rather a somewhat wry recollection of a self-indulgent adolescence. Even
      his remove to Ingolstadt and the most advanced medical school of central
      Europe is a decision totally "resolved" (I:2:1)
      by his parents. It is true that Victor has consistently appealed to a ruling
      destiny (I:1:14, I:2:19, III:4:41)
      to justify the course of his life. Indeed, it could be argued that his
      narrative to Walton constitutes a writing of the plot of that destiny,
      so that by its end every event in his life appears logically necessitated.
      In that case the force of his autobiography would require that the early
      chapters be revised to accommodate this narrative necessity. Once again
      the reader senses in its capacity for revision an underlying instability
      in the text of the novel. This indeterminacy is finely underscored in the
      1831 revision where "I
      believed myself destined"  is substituted for "I felt as if I were
      destined."

    This remark may be seen as less innocent than it appears at first. Victor is about to recount a trial in which it is essential that he exonerate himself. On a more interior level of the discourse we as readers are privy to a second narrative, which is meant by Victor to exonerate the course of his life to Walton and, through Walton, to posterity. This comment, then, links up with other instances, both early and late in the novel, in which Victor's concern with rhetorical propriety shadows a desire to write history so as to reflect well on him (see I:L4:30, I:3:13, and III:WC:2 and III:WC:4).

    As is often the case, what appears at first to be an indulgence in gothic hyperbole on Mary Shelley's part on second glance bears a startling exactness. The passion of revenge has been truly devouring Victor from within. The more obsessively he devotes himself to it the more assuredly he pursues his own destruction.

  As several editions of the novel have noted, this phrase was uttered by Julius Caesar when he crossed the Rubicon: it is quoted in the Life of Julius Caesar, the first of the Lives of the Twelve Caesars  of Caius Suetonius Tranquillus. Mary Shelley  read Suetonius in May 1817  while she was writing Frankenstein, so it is certain that she would not allude to this famous phrase without a sense of its actual context. Caesar goes forward to total victory, whereas it would seem in contrast that Walton returns in defeat. But perhaps the context is as ironic as that provided Victor's speech to the sailors  by Dante's Inferno  26. In such a case we might want to read Walton's superficial defeat as cloaking a moral victory.

 His desire for retreat is tied directly to that of the Creature, and Victor's

    The delicacy with which Elizabeth recognizes Victor's possible ambivalence to an eroticized relationship with her has the paradoxical effect of alerting us to its rougher corollary in events of the novel of which she is ignorant. Translated from the level domestic plane in which she is centered to the sublime heights where Victor and his Creature struggle, this ambivalence might seem strangely akin to the intense love-hate dynamic in which that homosocial relationship plays itself out.

  That Victor, who has throughout the novel been unable to fulfill his duties to either his family or his Creature, should be able to speak in such measured terms of a balance among multiple duties is certainly an indication of the objectivity and even wisdom to which he may aspire when he moves outside his own narrow concerns. That he specifically steps back from the coercive tone by which he had earlier tried to enlist Walton as his agent in murder (III:7:26) likewise testifies to his rediscovery of a moral center in his last hours of life.

    Victor, we should remind ourselves, comes from a long line of magistrates (see, e.g., I:1:1), and he has quite recently been on trial himself with the magistrate Mr. Kirwan leading his defence; so therefore it is clear that he perfectly well knows what their duties are.

Without this invigoration their situation could degenerate into a laxity of spirit and effort perilous to their well-being. Yet, the emptiness of mere rhetoric is likewise emphasized here, since the courage roused one day gives in to despondency the next. Words relate to reality only tangentially or conditionally, and when the reality remains implacable, Victor's signifying words appear hollow substitutes for its unavoidable presence.

  Walton refers to the last paragraph of Victor's narration (III:7:26 and note),

    In the very last paragraph of his narration (III:7:26 and note) Victor warned Walton to beware of mere eloquence, since the Creature's eloquence had once persuaded him to undertake a second monstrous creation to which on sober reflection he should not have agreed. Should we therefore construe Walton's faith in Victor's eloquence in similar terms? Or does it testify to the innate sympathy that eloquence forges between one human being and another? Again, Mary Shelley  seems to raise major questions only to leave them wholly ambiguous in their import.

    Mary Shelley  nicely returns us to the earlier concern with the relationship between eloquence and truth, between the representation of action and action itself, well aware of how the issue impinges both on her characters (particularly Victor's desire to vindicate himself to the world) and on her own art.

    As with the attention Walton gives to Victor's theatrical "command" in the opening paragraph of his resumed narrative (III:Walton:1 and note), we are here made conscious of how essentially manipulative (even if it could be argued to be not wholly intentional) is Victor's effort to insure that his perspective on events becomes the official record handed down to posterity.

    In the third volume Victor has increasingly come to refer to the Creature as a "daemon," thus not only dehumanizing him through an association with Satanic evil, but also, by conferring on the Creature a transcendental status, absolving himself as his Creator from any responsibility for his nature. In effect, linguistically, Victor is canceling his own role in the formation of the Creature.

                  <term>the events </term>
    That Mary Shelley principally wrote Frankenstein, and certainly its third volume, while living in Marlow, near Windsor and not far from Oxford, might logically have suggested to her the value of inserting its local scenery and history into her novel. More pointedly, her own tribute to her father, in dedicating her novel to Godwin, would have been underscored by her including scenes associated with his most recent novel Mandeville, centered on the English civil war in the mid-seventeenth century. For this politically-minded group of writers (Godwin, Mary Shelley, P. B. Shelley), the civil war had been, first and foremost, a conflict of ideologies pitting aristocratic against republican values. Although a century and a half past, its political resonanace was far from muted in a reactionary political climate like England's during the Regency. Thus, the political undertones of this choice of scenery on Mary Shelley's part are unlikely to have been in any sense innocent.
    <p> That said, there is another salient reason for the British setting of the earlier chapters of Volume 3, which is the simple fact that the novel is designed for an English-reading audience rather unaccustomed during the years of the Napoleonic Wars either themselves to travel abroad or to respond with much interest to a continental setting as sweeping as that embraced by the first two volumes. In its final volume Frankenstein  goes rather out of its way, as if designed according to formula, to embrace all three parts of the United Kingdom. </p>

    If we can believe that the Creature really used such language, then its very indistinguishability from Victor's, even down to the extreme hyperbole of the adjective, is another indication that at this late point in the novel, the two of them have become a single entity whose overriding passion is hatred and whose life force is provided by death.

  The plot of Frankenstein, with its insistent narrative mirrorings and doublings of character, seems always to be engaged in reexamining its own conduct, a process that contributes to the reader's skepticism about the truth of any single utterance by its protagonists. Here, in an epitome of this structural idiosyncrasy, we are told that Victor, after recounting his biography and then rewriting those parts of it he felt Walton had not succeeded in capturing in the manner in which he wanted them represented (III:Walton:4), has rethought the terms of his entire narrative and has revised it once more. That last revision, however, we will never read: the synopsis here presented does, however, differ in salient ways from the account we have been asked to accept as the truth.

    Walton is referring to Victor's own acute sense that the spirit world that guides him is vindictive (III:7:19) and exonerates him from normal codes of worldly justice or, indeed, responsibility for his acts as a member of society. Yet, the emphasis here on "his vengeance" suggests that Walton's apprehension is crucially different from Victor's own and serves to underscore the delusional, paranoid mentality that is now Victor's habitual mode of thought.

    This sentence suggests that, in this novel, nature as a principle, as is often the case with Enlightement materialist philosophy, is carrying something of the freight associated with the deity in earlier religious formulations. Nature is acknowledged as an enveloping principle of reality, and Clerval's feeling for it marks both his largeness of mind and disinterested perspective.

    Sir Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland, was one of the principal Cavaliers in the service of Charles I. He died at the Battle of Newbury on 20 September 1643. His name and exalted notion of honor were, it would appear, used by William Godwin  as models for the hero-villain Count Ferdinando Falkland of The Adventures of Caleb Williams. Today Falkland's fame is sustained by his serving as one of the subjects of Ben Jonson's enduring tribute "To the Immortal Memory and Friendship of That Nobel Pair Sir Lucius Cary and Sir H. Morison," one of the first true odes in the English tradition.
    <p> The somewhat surprising emphasis on royalist values in this paragraph is suggestive of a historical politics far removed from that elsewhere insinuated into Frankenstein  (see, for instance, II:5:16) or shared by Mary Shelley  with her father and Percy. These references are perhaps best explained within the context of the novel William Godwin published about a month before Frankenstein  appeared, Mandeville: A Tale of the Seventeenth Century in England. The protagonist of that novel is an ultra-Royalist who, as his cause deteriorates, retreats further and further into morbid self-obsession. The emotional dynamics of Mandeville, if not the portraiture itself, are consonant with the psychological makeup of Victor Frankenstein. </p>

 His aim seems less to complete a difficult assignment than to procrastinate
 as long as possible. Whatever one might argue in extenuation of his motives,
 it seems clear in this passage that he gives no thought whatsoever to the Creature's
 well-being. Perhaps it was with some sense of mitigating these unflattering
 character traits that in 1831 Mary Shelley revised
 this passage  to suggest a greater degree of responsibility on Victor's

    of convalescence was necessary to restore him to a state in which he could
    withstand his trial in Ireland (see III:4:11 and

      Victor has been described as feverish since his collapse following the death of Clerval (III:4:11). The symptoms point to tuberculosis, known in the early nineteenth century as consumption because the body wasted away under the advance of the disease. Such a disease would be correlative to, and even emblematic of, Victor's mental condition.

    In this extreme silence the intrusion of human sounds not only testifies to the ongoing processes of everyday life, but reminds us that even in the farthest reaches of the globe human beings establish a basic community one with the other. These sounds from the darkness at once remind us of the Creature's yearning to participate in such a community and reinforce Victor's total self-exclusion from its claims. Moreover, surely there is an intentional irony here pitting the productive labor of the fishermen, who in turn depend upon it for their sustenance, against the long-postponed and now aborted labor of Victor, who is financially free of such necessities, as well as the lack of productive community in which the Creature is forced to exist.

  Although one of the definitions in Johnson's Dictionary  describes the substantive of this word as "any violent affection of mind or body," in general the connotation emphasized is the temporary state of the affliction. In contrast, Victor's enthusiastic obsession was years in its gestation, and it was succeeded by another, more lethal obsession with the destruction of the being he created. In other words, though the madness he admits to may have taken several forms, it has been unremitting since he entered upon his studies at the University of Ingolstadt. As Victor's diction appears to mitigate its force, it suggests that even now, in his final assessment, he is unwilling fully to engage his own culpability.

    Although there is some small hint of this function for Clerval in various
    parts of the first volume, only here, after the establishment of a complex
    doubling between Victor and the Creature, does Mary Shelley extend the pattern
    to involve Clerval. Given Mary Shelley's setting Clerval within the context
    of Wordsworth's "Tintern Abbey" in the previous chapter (III:1:21), it is
    hard not to hear in this phrase the timbres Wordsworth addresses to his sister
    in that poem (lines 116-19).

    The inclusion of this resonant diction seems intended to establish a linkage between the personal and more public conceptions of responsibility that can be traced through the novel. Although Victor, and recently his father too, think of him as haunted by a destiny over which he has no control (III:4:43), Elizabeth's language is firmly rooted in the primacy of choice in all human relations. Her rejection of a male concept of honor here seems to link it to stereotypes of behavior that at once shackle the will and suspend the individual's ultimate responsibility for actions and their consequences.

In reinstating that wish, Walton reminds us of how very little time has actually elapsed in the narrative frame of the novel as well as of how violent and destructive such intense relationships can become when they are based on hatred rather than affection.

                  <term>generous and self-devoted being </term>
    
  In a novel in which oxymorons have increasingly come to represent implacable ambivalences, this summary of Victor Frankenstein stands out as an epitome. If readers should wonder whether it is really possible so to overlay what appear to be opposite constructions, a scrupulous respect for earlier connotations of the terms will sharpen the meaning if not wholly dispel its ambiguities. Dr. Johnson's Dictionary  (1755) lists these meanings for "generous":
  <list type="simple">
                     <item>Not of mean birth; of good extraction. </item>
                     <item>Noble of mind; magnanimous; open of heart. </item>
                     <item>Liberal; munificent. </item>
                     <item>Strong; vigorous. </item>
                  </list>
  It is clear that the third, which is the customary modern sense of the word, would be generally inappropriate to the figure that Victor Frankenstein has cut in this novel, but either of the other three meanings would in one phase or another of his existence adequately characterize him. The main thrust of the Creature's meaning is probably the second. Even here, however, some readers might wish to cavil, asking whether, given Frankenstein's ambitions and good intentions but customary self-enclosure, it would be possible to retain a nobility of mind without being greatly magnanimous or open-hearted.
  <p> With "self-devoted," the range of possibility is even greater and likewise is further from a modern, loose conception of the term as meaning "devoted to one's self." The three definitions of "to devote" in Johnson's Dictionary  are: </p>
                  <list type="simple">
                     <item>to dedicate; to consecrate; to appropriate </item>
                     <item>to addict; to give up to ill </item>
                     <item>to curse; to execrate; to doom to destruction </item>
                  </list>
  All of these definitions have a bearing on Victor Frankenstein's character, even simultaneously so, but in the context of the Creature's expression of "wildest rage," an attribute mirrored between him and his creator, the last of the definitions would seem to bear a particular relevance.

    The atmosphere of the third volume of the novel, with the exception of the honeymoon excursion along Lake Geneva, has been so far from genial that the reader is enjoined at this point to recall the original balancing of the novel, in which the civilized bourgeois world of the Frankenstein household represents the beautiful against the sublime of Mont Blanc  and the Creature whom Victor encounters there in the second volume (II:2:5).

    This is only the second occasion in which the Creature is perceived smiling (the first is in I:4:3), and in each case Victor interprets an expression of pleasure and anticipation as alien, even diabolical.

    As this paragraph suggests ("the fiend" . . . "the fiend" . . . "a gigantic monster"), the creation of an abnormal identity through naming has become wholly habitual on Victor's part. We have here, however, one last indication that, wherever the Creature goes, he is immediately accorded the status of monster by the human beings he encounters.

    There is no little irony in this phrase, since Victor has already in a material sense, given "life and spirit" to his Creature and even to his Creature as "enemy." Given his manifest failure on the level of the actual, his desire to succeed on the level of the merely textual may be understandable, but it is no less morally problematic. Having the last word must be a poor substitute for acting with foresight and responsibility in the first place.

                  <term>the glimmer of two eyes </term>
    This is an unmistakeable reference to "Alastor," the poem Percy Bysshe Shelley  published in March 1816  a few months before the excursion to Lake Geneva. The protagonist of that poem is haunted by the two eyes of a "veilèd maid" (line 151) of whom he dreamed and whom he subsequently pursues to the end of his life. As he dies his last glimpse is of "two lessening points of light [that] / Gleamed through the darkness" (lines 654-55), an all-consuming ideal that is the ironic cause of his destruction.

                  <term>glorious creature </term>
                  <p>The shading here seems deliberately suggestive of Milton's Satan. From the very first, the Satanic legions sense that the fall from heaven has diminished their spiritual essence, and, as in these early words of Satan's chief follower Beelzebub, that loss is expressed in terms of "glory." <lb/>the mind and spirit remains <lb/>
      Invincible, and vigour soon returns, <lb/>
      Though all our glory extinct, and happy state <lb/>
      Here swallowed up in endless misery. (I.139-42)  
    The most resonant identification of diminished glory with the fall of the angels is uttered by Satan as he soliloquizes atop Mount Niphates at the opening of Book IV. There, as he addresses the Sun, the fallen archangel directly contrasts himself and God in terms of their manifestation of glory. <lb/> O thou, that, with surpassing glory crowned, <lb/>
  Lookest from thy sole dominion like the God <lb/>
      Of this new world; at whose sight all the stars <lb/>
      Hide their diminished heads; to thee I call, <lb/>
      But with no friendly voice, and add thy name, <lb/>
      O Sun! to tell thee how I hate thy beams, <lb/>
      That bring to my remembrance from what state <lb/>
      I fell, how glorious once above thy sphere; <lb/>
      Till pride and worse ambition threw me down <lb/>
    Warring in Heaven against Heaven's matchless King. (IV.32-41) </p>

                  <term>The Greeks wept for joy </term>
                  <p>Mary Shelley  refers to the account of the long Greek retreat from Armenia in Xenophon's Anabasis, 4.7, quoted here in the translation
    	of Carleton L. Brownson (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1918): </p>
                  <p>{329}<lb/>
        [18] Leaving this land [of the Chalybians], the Greeks arrived at the Harpasus river, which was four plethra in width. From there they marched through the territory of the Scythinians four stages, twenty parasangs, over a level plain, and they arrived at some villages, and there remained for three days and collected provisions.
        </p>
                  <p> [19] From there they journeyed four stages, twenty parasangs, to a large and prosperous inhabited city which was called Gymnias. From this city the ruler of the land sent the Greeks a guide, in order to lead them through territory that was hostile to his own. </p>
                  <p> [20] When the guide came, he said that he would lead them within five days to a place from which they could see the sea; if he failed to do so, he was ready to accept death. Thus taking the lead, as soon as he had brought them into the hostile territory, he kept urging them to spread abroad fire and ruin, thereby making it clear that it {331} was with this end in view that he had come, and not out of good-will toward the Greeks. </p>
                  <p> [21] On the fifth day they did in fact reach the mountain; its name was Theches. Now as soon as the vanguard got to the top of the mountain, a great shout went up. </p>
                  <p> [22] And when Xenophon and the rearguard heard it, they imagined that other enemies were attacking in front; for enemies were following behind them from the district that was in flames, and the rearguard had killed some of them and captured others by setting an ambush, and had also taken about twenty wicker shields covered with raw, shaggy ox-hides. </p>
                  <p> [23] But as the shout kept getting louder and nearer, as the successive ranks that came up all began to run at full speed toward the ranks ahead that were one after another joining in the shout, and as the shout kept growing far louder as the number of men grew steadily greater, it became quite clear to Xenophon that here was something of unusual importance; </p>
                  <p> [24] so he mounted a horse, took with him Lycius and the cavalry, and pushed ahead to lend aid; and in a moment they heard the soldiers shouting, "The Sea! The Sea!" and passing the word along. Then all the troops of the rearguard likewise broke into a run, and the pack animals began racing ahead and the horses. </p>
                  <p> [25] And when all had reached the summit, then indeed they fell to embracing one another, and generals and captains as well, with tears in their eyes. And on a sudden, at the bidding of some one or other, the soldiers began to bring stones and to build a great cairn. </p>
                  <p> [26] Thereon they placed as offerings a quantity of raw ox-hides and walking-sticks and the captured wicker shields; and the guide not only cut these {333} shields to pieces himself, but urged the others to do so. </p>
                  <p> [27] After this the Greeks dismissed the guide with gifts from the common stock -- a horse, a silver cup, a Persian dress, and ten darics; but what he particularly asked the men for was their rings, and he got a considerable number of them. Then he showed them a village to encamp in and the road they were to follow to the country of the Macronians, and, as soon as evening came, took his departure. </p>

    Careful attention to detail here renders Victor's account dubious. With all lights extinguished so that the room is only illuminated by the moon, it would appear next to impossible for Victor so sharply to distinguish a visage that would be backlit in such circumstances. Neither the Creature's own narration in the second volume nor his account of his struggles with Victor Frankenstein at the end accords with such a perspective of fiendish exultation in evil. This portrait is, however, wholly commensurate with Victor's increasing tendency to demonize the Creature. See I:6:22, II:2:6, and III:3:2.

                  <term>the ground sea </term>
    As time has disappeared, so has the conventional security of space. Under the terrifying, antihuman solidity of this barren field of ice, even where mountains appear to arise from it, there is open and fluid water capable of erupting with terrifying sublimity. Victor is, in fact, at sea; he has become the ancient mariner that the continual evocation of Coleridge's text across the length of the novel has presaged.
    <p> According to the Oxford English Dictionary: </p>GROUND-SEA

    The fluid undercurrent belying the solidity of this iceworld (see also III:7:20 and note) erupts with extraordinary effect, almost as an objective correlative for the "burning gush of hope" and "heart pound[ing]" remarked within Victor in the previous paragraphs. This ground-sea appears as almost a metaphor for the essentially human that even in the most extreme of circumstances cannot be repressed.

    The reader might well wish to contemplate the oddly contradictory character of this formulation. Although Victor can exonerate himself by means of analytical logic, the process is not liberating. Instead, psychologically he finds himself in a limbo of uncertainty and incapacity, haunted by a dread he can neither escape nor define. Given the increasingly psychotic symptoms he will reveal in the later chapters of the novel, this early formulation may be considered a touchstone for Victor's successive mental breakdowns.

    The assurance of a guiding spirit on Victor's part is now total, but the previous references in this chapter, in their shaded ambiguity, along with the context of P. B. Shelley's "Alastor, or the Spirit of Solitude"  (published February 1816), compel the reader to question whether that guardian is a good angel or an evil spirit, an alastor.

    This is not, perhaps, so innocuous a statement as it at first appears. Why should such a statement matter to this narrative, except by way of reminding us that the Creature, besides being a vegetarian, exists wholly outside the economy that links Victor with other human beings? This is a telling reminder of the isolation of his uniqueness, of how on a literal level all of humankind implicitly conspire to exclude him from their interchange.

                  <term>that half kind of belief </term>
    With so many allusions to Coleridge's writings governing the exposition of this novel, including the very notion of such a reiterated self-justification as Victor is presenting (see III:6:21 and note), it would not be surprising to see this remark as a recasting of his fine distinction between truth and the "willing suspension of disbelief" in literature (see Biographia Literaria, Chapter 14). But, in fact, there is no assurance that Mary Shelley  would have come upon the formulation in time to have inserted it into the novel. P. B. Shelley  is recorded as having finished Coleridge's Biographia Literaria  on 8 December 1817. Frankenstein  was advertised as published on 1 January 1818.

    This is very much in the spirit with which Byron  represents the Rhine  in Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, Canto 3, stanza 45ff.: see particularly his summary in stanzas 59-61. Clerval prefers the beautiful, with its humanistic overtones, to the sublime with its otherworldly and supernatural associations. It is indicative that he centers his descriptions of the landscape upon human images—the priest and his mistress, grape-pickers among the vines—who give historical or local significance to its details.

               <item>
                  <term>Havre </term>
    Le Havre  is a principal seaport of Normandy: Mary, Shelley, and Claire Clairmont  embarked for England  from Le Havre when they returned from Geneva  in September 1816 . The town would have held more than a tourist's interest for Mary. Her mother Mary Wollstonecraft  had moved to Le Havre to escape the Terror of 1794: there she wrote her Historical and Moral View of the Origin and Progress of the French Revolution  and gave birth to her daughter Fanny Imlay, Mary's half-sister, in May of that year.
    <p> In the 1831 revision Mary Shelley has Victor and his father sail directly from Dublin  to Le Havre, avoiding the lengthy coach journey across England in the 1818 novel. This, perhaps, reflects a more sophisticated sense of the historical geography of the British Isles gained after her return to England in 1823. Over many centuries Ireland  had maintained a commercial and cultural exchange with France that flourished independently from the frames of reference in which the British viewed the power that was increasingly its major antagonist. Napoleon's attempt to capitalize on the Wolfe Tone rebellion of 1798  underscored the dangers implicit in Ireland's independent foreign relations, leading directly to the Act of Union of 1801  in which Ireland was assimilated to the British crown. </p>

    By this time in his experience Victor might have learned to distrust such
    a state of self-induced euphoria. It is literally the case that every time
    he indulges himself in such a light-headed sense that he has escaped his "destiny," he
    is suddenly caught up short by a new misfortune. (See I:5:17 and
    II:2:1).

    The rhetorical overload here may be considered an appropriate expression of what has become as well for Victor a totalized psychological overload. The "rage" that immediately chokes off his speech is its manifestation.

    The sharp suspension of narrative line here coincides with a self-regarding
    emphasis on story-telling of a sort that we have witnessed earlier (I:L4:30, I:3:13).
    Such a mirroring of the function of narrative will become a dominant motif
    in the late pages of the novel. This act of doubling seems to entail another,
    identifying the creation that is Victor's tale with his earlier creation,
    the being who five paragraphs earlier had presented to his sight "a figure
    the most hideous and deformed" (III:6:10).

                  <term>A high destiny </term>
    
      This final sentence of Victor's retrospective memoir ends in a tone of great pathos stemming from the most innocuous of verbs: "seemed." Reversing the assurance with which the paragraph began, here Victor comes close to acknowledging that all his talk of and even reliance on a sense of special destiny is empty of signification. If there is no actual destiny, then there is also no particular meaning to what he has done that can exonerate his actions or the path of destruction left in their wake.

                  <term>line of high land </term>
    The north coast of Ireland  near Scotland  is among the most formidable in the British Isles, with high cliffs and a treacherous series of great rocks called the Giant's Causeway  upthrust from the sea. At this time, as Mary Shelley's exposition indicates, the basic livelihood for the inhabitants was earned from these dangerous waters.

    Up to this point in the novel nursing has been the domain of friends and
    family, and the willingness to engage in it has been the mark of selfless
    affection and respect. We recall that Victor's mother Caroline dies from
    the effects of nursing Elizabeth Lavenza through an adolescent attack of
    scarlet fever (I:2:2)
    and that Justine Moritz, in her turn, contracts the disease from attending
    on Caroline Frankenstein and herself falls "very ill" (I:5:5)
    as a result. Although not vulnerable to consequences so life-threatening,
    Henry Clerval acts as Victor's "only nurse" during the months-long nervous
    fever that incapacitates him after the Creature is brought to life (I:4:17).

                  <term>Holyhead</term>
                  <p>Holyhead, on the island of Angelsey, which lies off the northwest coast of Wales, in the eighteenth century had developed into the major port linking Ireland and the British Isles. It was the closest landing place to Dublin, with some 100 kilometers of the Irish Sea intervening. Since, however, Anglesey was an island, passengers still had to negotiate the treacherous Menai Strait linking it to the mainland. In 1810 Thomas Telford was commissioned at this site to build the first suspension bridge in the world as part of a modernization of the coach road to Holyhead.</p>
                  <p>Mary Shelley never traced this itinerary, but Percy did, both going to and returning from his Dublin adventure via Holyhead in 1812. Mary Wollstonecraft had also taken this route when she took up her post as governess in the Irish seat of Lord and Lady Kingsborough in 1786. </p>

  Honour is a concept that, until now, has figured only modestly in this novel.
  One earlier reference, however, might be construed to have a bearing on Walton's
  present insistence on its claims. This comes in Elizabeth's letter of commiseration
  to Victor about his illness while in Ingolstadt. There she testified to her
  accord with Ernest's desire to be a farmer, though it were a less "honourable
  occupation" (I:5:2)
  than that of a judge. In her letter the idea of honour is tied to social and
  class hierarchies, perhaps as well to distinctions between gender roles. It
  is clear that in Walton's eyes his crew are, to return to Victor's formulation
  (III:Walton:17),
  lesser men than they would be if they were possessed of a sense of honorable
  duty to the cause to which their master has committed them.

    Victor is transforming himself into the alastor, the evil spirit, that has been his own guardian spirit through this chapter. But what he foresees is grisly, himself as one of the living dead, a zombie haunting the ongoing processes of life among the living. Remarkable as it may seem, this final vision is, in effect, an image of one last Creature let go from his hands as a free and frighteningly independent agent on earth: himself. Perhaps, however, that was what he became from the point at which he matriculated at Ingolstadt  and entered into the world of his obsessions.

    It appears in this novel that whenever the serenity of nature is emphasized (I:5:17, III:3:6), the sublime power represented by the Creature is introduced to disturb its tranquillity. Before, however, it was Victor who felt the effect of this natural profusion. Here, clearly, Elizabeth is identified with a natural beneficence that Victor over the course of the past five years has all but forsaken. What distinguishes her examples is the ability she demonstrates to see all elements in motion; in their varied relations with one another; and in their distinct particularity, whether distant and high (Mônt Blanc) or near and deep (the bottom of Lake Geneva), rather than according to some reductive model by which they are made identical and rendered inanimate.

    A further instance of Victor's reconstruction of the Creature's emotions as diabolical so as not to have to confront their actual nature. The howl represents, indeed, a reaction of despair following an entire year's attentuated expectation, a year spent in solitude and without any other hope. In turn, that understanding tends to ironize Victor's own emotional dependency on Clerval during their trip. Both creator and creature are here at last equally alone in their solitude, unconsciously prepared to transfer their entire gamut of emotional needs into a single-minded pursuit of the other's destruction.

    The return of Alphonse Frankenstein to the narrative center of the novel brings with it the vexed tension between father and son observed in the early chapters when Victor was an adolescent. Victor's silence here, of course, is of no advantage in bringing Alphonse to a better understanding of his by-now adult scion. Perhaps the son's reticence is meant not just to mark his fear that the truth of his guilt would not be countenanced by his father but also to implicate this strained history between them.

    This sentence carries an interestingly pointed balance. Everywhere in the novel, in accord with Enlightenment values, human sympathy is marked as the foundation for personal and social happiness. Here one infers that Mary Shelley recognizes that even this virtue can lead to a measure of self-absorption in the merely human, at the expense of an external reality principle embodied in nature.

      Until this very late point in the novel we have only been able to assume that Margaret Saville, because of the difference in her surname, has a husband. With this confirmed, we discover as well that she has children. One reason Mary Shelley  may be supplying this information now would be to justify the emotional intensity of this outpouring in which Walton in solitude and dire straits reaches out to his only family connections. But by the same token, that connectedness contrasts pointedly with the situation in the Frankenstein household, where when the novel ends only Ernest, who would seem to have little to recommend him beyond being a dull and regular fellow, will survive its events.

  In their monosyllabic simplicity these words constitute the moral center of Mary Shelley's novel. Against all his prejudices as Victor's friend, against his repugnance to face a multiple murderer, against his basic human instincts that revolt from such sublime ugliness, Robert Walton wills himself into a state of ethical selflessness that is truly benevolent. The Creature's "wonder" at this unique experience in his existence is only to be expected. He has never before been confronted by human inclusiveness.

  This is a word with considerable resonance by this point in the novel. Victor has carefully kept Walton ignorant of the process by which he created life, and, moreover, excoriates him when he suspects Walton of wanting to penetrate his secret (III:Walton:3). He dies clearly wishing that he had himself remained in a state of innocent ignorance. Although it is likely that, upon reflection, Walton will broaden the range under which he construes knowledge to embrace a moral education, here he limits its conception wholly to scientific discovery. In his dejection he seems to have gone out of his way to miss the point of Victor Frankenstein's narration, which is itself truly a mark of his ignorance.

                  <term>the strangest tale that ever imagination formed </term>
    There may be an element of self-puffery by Mary Shelley  in this statement, yet it is surprisingly prescient in its sense of the cultural impact her novel was to have. Moreover, it is entirely consistent with the way both she and her husband represented the work to its public. Percy Bysshe Shelley, writing the Preface to the original edition of Frankenstein, distanced this novel from any attempt at "merely weaving a series of supernatural terrors," insisting on its adherence to the higher aims of the "imagination." Similarly, Mary Shelley, in writing the Introduction to the third edition, stresses how in its initial conception her "imagination, unbidden, possessed and guided" her. That all these statements are congruent with one another and with an exalted notion of the Romantic imagination, however, cannot alter the ironic context in which this particular phrase is uttered. In the previous paragraph we have been observing Victor Frankenstein, who was once swept along by his imagination to create a deformed and alienated being, revising with soberly rational care his account of that act and its consequences. The actual context for this phrase in the novel would thus appear to offset its perhaps expected paean to the imagination.

      Victor's remembrance alters the emphasis of his earlier account, which contrasted his own interest in facticity with Elizabeth's (and Henry Clerval's) delight in the imagination (I:1:9). However much he may be inflating the record here, the reader cannot but be aware of the ambivalence about the nature of the imagination expressed in these lines. That Victor once "trod heaven in [his] thoughts" cannot mitigate the hellish misery to which he has now sunk, nor even at that earlier point in his remembrance could it guarantee that the outcome of such an introverted elation would have an essential value. The imagination, in this analysis, might be necessary for great achievement, but by itself it is by no means sufficient, being merely an instrument, and, as such, easily capable of indulging a self-absorbed solipsism.

  The repression of instinctive response continues as Walton, deeply mindful of the solemn and reiterated injunction of Victor Frankenstein to exact vengeance upon his Creature, hesitates before the presence of the other being. In essence, he substitutes a reality for an abstraction, his own actuality for the vicarious experience provided by Victor's narrative. Implied in this act is the priority of individual responsibility for independent judgment. That Walton is preoccupied by his "impulses" in the plural may indicate how difficult, complex, and responsive to particular circumstances such a judgment must be.

    This addition to the 1831 text recalls the changed circumstances by which Elizabeth enters into the Frankenstein household, as the natural daughter of a revolutionary Milanese aristocrat who had been imprisoned by the Austrian government and had had his property confiscated (see I:1:9) for being too ardent in the cause of his country's liberty. Although Alphonse Frankenstein's dealings here might be construed as an honorable, duty-bound attempt by a citizen of a neutral nation to right a wrong and restore to Elizabeth what had been rightly hers, it is hard to imagine Mary Shelley, who abhorred the Austrian occupation of Italy and represented Elizabeth's true father as "nursed in the antique glory of Italy," not thinking this detail commensurate with the essentially conservative, state-oriented political views Alphonse exhibits elsewhere (see, for instance, I:1:1 or I:6:44 and note).

 well. However we construe his hesitancy, Victor's total rerouting of his itinerary

 social obligations. </p>

    Improbably, Victor has floated some hundreds of miles. Moreover, as we discover in the next chapter he is not the only one who has traversed the open seas southwest of the Orkneys  to land on the northeast coast of Ireland. Although it has been suggested that including Ireland in the expansive geographical range of the novel may be Mary Shelley's means of honoring her mother, who served as a governess there, the strangeness of this repositioning of setting has never been adequately accounted for.
    <p> From Victor's reference to "a line of high land" (III:3:26), we may suppose
      that Mary Shelley has in mind geological features like the Giant's Causeway,
      a line of huge islets, or the cliffs of Fair Head. </p>

Now that Walton's ship veers to the south, remaining aboard can no longer serve his purpose, which is as single-minded in its vengeance as ever.

    Lacking the journal of Clerval, we will have to settle for that of Mary Shelley, who traversed this route in 1814  and published it in her History of a Six Weeks' Tour  just before Frankenstein. At that time the point of departure for the Shelley party was Basel.
    <p> Yet, that we lack Clerval's journal might in context seem strange. The entire novel is based on the presence of an overload of documentary information that includes the letters of Alphonse Frankenstein and Elizabeth Lavenza, the journal letter of Robert Walton, his representation of Victor's narrative (dutifully "corrected" by Victor), which in turn contains the Creature's narrative, which is, in part, attested to by the letters of Felix that the Creature promised  to leave with Victor when he finished. If we lack this last piece of evidence, however, we do not lack its effect on the narrative, since Victor here calls attention to the nature and quality of Clerval's writing. </p>

    The Jura  massif runs to the northwest of Geneva  and serves as a natural barrier to an armed adventure from neighboring France. This is clearly a reference to the French invasion of Switzerland  in the spring of 1798, when, it must be said, the Jura wholly failed in this protective office. Still, why such a strong political sentiment should be intruded by Victor Frankenstein at this point is not readily explicable. Perhaps what the reader is intended to recognize is that Victor's distancing himself within a political context allows him to forget the last time all these features of the landscape were brought together by him in a single perspective, the night he first encountered his Creature outside Geneva (I:6:17).

      Questions of justice have entered this novel from various directions, spanning
      the Creature's plea for a mate (II:9:2, II:9:8)
      to the condemnation of Justine Moritz (I:7:1). What may be most interesting
      about Walton's invocation of the term is his implicit understanding of
      the notion of disinterested equity, a notion wholly absent from the closed
      circle of antagonism in which Victor and his Creature exist. For Mary Shelley
      to introduce such a concept this late in the novel might suggest an effort
      on her part to establish an ethical code by which readers can take the
      measure of the novel's characters and events.

That representation, in any case, would not be far from her mind, since it was written in the summer of 1816  and, indeed, when the Shelleys returned to England  they carried the manuscript of the poem with them.

                  <term>a small quantity of laudanum </term>
    This revelation helps greatly to explain Victor's manic changes of mood, from almost delirious emotionality to an impassive lethargy. Laudanum, a form of liquified opium, was a narcotic freely available in the latter part of the eighteenth century. In those days its usage lacked the social stigma that would be attached to it by later cultures and it was commonly employed in all stations of society. Thomas DeQuincey's Confessions of an English Opium-Eater  was published in its first version in two installments of the London Magazine  in 1821, three years after the publication of Frankenstein, making his literary reputation overnight. Percy Bysshe Shelley  seems to have used laudanum to dull the pain of the chronic nephritis from which he suffered. Mary Shelley, however, was also well aware of the more consequential abuses to which laudanum lent itself. Her half-sister, Fanny Imlay, the daughter of Mary Wollstonecraft  and the American Gilbert Imlay, committed suicide by an overdose of laudanum in November of 1816, while Mary Shelley was still in the early stages of her novel. Thus, this detail must be seen as colored by that tragic event. At the very least, it is a further indication of the deep instability of Victor Frankenstein's mind at this juncture of his career.

    These were the letters Safie wrote Felix imploring his aid in the rescue of her father from prison and that she had translated from Turkish into French. In recounting this episode, the Creature had promised to give Victor the copies he had made of them (II:6:7), and this offhand reference suggests that he did so. The logical completion of that strand of the narrative does not, of course, explain just why Victor Frankenstein, embarked on an odyssey of epic proportions where he can scarcely provide himself with the essentials of life, is carrying the translated correspondence of a perfect stranger.

    Mary Shelley  here offers another accentuation of the adversarial masculinist code that has dominated Victor's perspective on his Creature and blinded him to the dangers to which he has exposed his loved ones. The melodramatic posturing, it should be emphasized, does have a purpose if we remind ourselves that this first-person narrative is delivered to a listener, Robert Walton, who at the end of the next chapter will reenter the novel. Since Victor is well aware that Walton is preserving this record as an exemplary warning to later human generations, he has every reason to try to influence the portrait thus handed down to the future.

Whatever the problems of the fictional time scheme, it is apparent that for the past four-and-a-half years, which is the lifetime of Victor's offspring, not to neglect the months of concentrated labor that went into his gestation, Victor has been obsessed with the Creature to the neglect, even destruction, of any other relationship.

    Given the past consequences on his friends and family of Victor's silence, particularly in his never explaining to Clerval the possible danger to his existence from accompanying him to Britain, Victor's continuing reticence seems perverse. Yet, at the same time, when he is driven at last to depose himself to the law, the fact that he is treated with patronizing incredulity and wholly exonerated from any responsibility for the wake of destruction that has visited his family circle (see III:6:24), is a subtle touch on Mary Shelley's part. Conventional human expectation, of necessity, protects itself from whatever is beyond its normal range of experience.

    Alphonse Frankenstein had raised exactly the same question with Victor at the beginning of the fifth chapter (III.5.5),  and the Genevan magistrate seems to have been assured of the matter from his interview at the end of the sixth (III.6.28). For readers who by this point in the novel might well have come to the same conclusion, Victor's questioning of Walton's mental stability would venture on the absurd. From the larger perspective of the novel's development, however, the strange echo emphasizes how relative, given the acute isolation in which its three male protagonists have come to exist, have become all grounds of reason and normalcy.

    As elsewhere in these paragraphs the candor of Victor's language is unexpected
    and surprising. Earlier in his narration he has used "enthusiasm" as an apology,
    even perhaps as a cover for his lack of responsibility (see I:3:3,
    I:3:8, I:3:14, and III:2:21). This linking of his obsession with creating life to
    a state of madness will be reinforced near the end of the novel where Victor
    will reflect on his endeavor as a "fit of enthusiastic madness" (III:Walton:28).

    The language seems scrupulously chosen to indicate a transference of madness into the obsession of revenge: which is to say that, though his vindictiveness allows Victor to focus his mind wholly on this pursuit, the aim may nonetheless be construed as insane. After the death of Elizabeth and his father, Victor seems not so much to recover his mental health as to concentrate his madness.

      The notion of madness, encountered frequently in the late chapters of the novel, has been associated almost entirely with Victor Frankenstein's disturbed mental state. This small shift in rhetoric for the 1831 edition, coming as it does eight paragraphs after Victor's impassioned questioning of Walton's naive desire to know "the particulars of his creature's formation" ("Are you mad, my friend . . . ?"—see III:Walton:3 and note), suggests that, for this novel, madness may be less a matter of actual derangement than it is a kind of violation of accepted codes of social conduct whereby the individual becomes isolated from the community and communal obligations. Its closest synonymn might then be "solipsism," which is an issue with deep roots within Romanticism and one that is stressed in these final pages of Frankenstein.

There is likewise to be observed here a curious symmetry, since at the other end of Victor's trip to the British Isles is another magistrate who, in effect, authorized it, Alphonse Frankenstein.

 above other features of the landscape to dominate the horizon. In the late nineteenth
 century Thomas Hardy paints an enduring picture of the young Jude Fawley, the
 hero of Jude the Obscure  who has mythicized what is there denominated
 Christminster, venturing far out of his village and climbing a ladder at sunset
 with the hope of making out this far-off object of all his desires: </p>
                  <p>Some way

        roof slates, and other shining spots upon the spires, domes, freestone-work,
        and varied outlines that were faintly revealed. It was Christminster,
       unquestionably; either directly seen, or miraged in the peculiar atmosphere.</p>
                  <p> The spectator gazed on till the windows and vanes lost their shine,

    Home-sickness. Why Victor should lapse into his native tongue here, the single such instance in his lengthy account to Walton, is a mystery. Perhaps it is meant as another instance of his euphemisms, suggestive of an essential insincerity in his representation of his motives.

    The Oxford English Dictionary  nicely captures the rationale for Victor's use of this Latinism, defining the term in the plural, as the deified souls of departed ancestors (as beneficent spirits; opposed to larvæ and lemures, the malevolent shades of the Lower World). Also, the spirit, `shade' of a departed person, considered as an object of homage or reverence, or as demanding to be propitiated by vengeance. 
    The manes Victor lists here have in the aggregate constituted the guiding
    spirits that throughout this chapter he has invoked as demanding his intercession
    to avenge their deaths. Upon his own death he foresees himself joining their
    number. If Walton is expected to pick up the family cause, perhaps in thinking
    of Victor as "the brother of [his] heart" (I:L4:22) he has got much more
    than he bargained for.

    Portending a reversal of the father-son roles both Victor and the Creature have implicitly relied on, this assertion of the Creature's power contrasts markedly with Victor's chronic indecision and impotence. From this point on, as this language intimates, both are locked in the embrace of their mutual anatagonism.

    The word "materials" is the euphemism Victor customarily uses for the human and animal parts out of which he constructs the beings to which he intends to impart life. Now reduced to a psychological wretchedness, his physical being seems to him equivalent to these shards of undifferentiated flesh. Mary Shelley  subtly reaffirms Victor's growing identification with his miserable Creature.

                  <term>8th of May </term>
                  <p> The timetable seems seriously awry at this point. Henry Clerval was murdered
 in late August. Victor's subsequent breakdown forced a two-month delay during
 which his father was summoned, and the trial seems to have transpired about
 a month after Alphonse Frankenstein's arrival. This would put it in the December
 following the summer's removal to the Orkney
 Islands. Victor's release from prison ensued in a fortnight (III:4:44),
 and he records that thereafter he and his father left Ireland  as
 speedily as they could (III:4:48).
 Thus, the arrival in Paris  should
 come some four months earlier than Elizabeth's letter makes it. This error is
 attenuated in the first edition, we may remember, by a similar lapse of time
 in the trip to England, where, though it appears that Victor and Henry begin
 their trip down the Rhine in early September, they are not reported as having
 crossed the channel until the "latter days of September " (III:1:24). </p>
                  <p> Scrutiny of the surviving manuscripts suggests that Mary
        Shelley  had her chronology straight the first time around and for
        some reason changed her mind and then, again, subsequently compounded
        the confusion. In the draft she originally had Victor and his father
        arrive in Le
        Havre  on the "8th of Feb." and dated Elizabeth's letter from Geneva  "February
        18th;" then in each case she crossed out the month, substituting "May." In
        the fair copy intended for the printer, Elizabeth's letter was first
        dated "April," but this designation was cancelled and replaced with "May
        18th." </p>

  Curiously, in this respect the Creature is the opposite of Victor Frankenstein, whom he otherwise mirrors in so many aspects. Victor was so preoccupied with inscribing his experiences in such a way as to exonerate himself that he corrected Walton's transcript of his narration (III:Walton:4). Oddly enough, the only tangible memory that the Creature existed is embodied in Walton's manuscript, of which he is ignorant.

    Upon a moment's reflection the reader will recognize that Victor, by this term, means the primitive Furies of classical myth. Their most prominent realization in Greek literature is in Aeschylus's Oresteia, where, as enacted in the third part of the trilogy, The Eumenides, the Furies are persuaded by Athena to give over their ritual vengeance to a new and more civilized system of justice that will henceforth regulate human behavior. For Victor thus to invoke the Furies suggests his reversion to a primitive bloodlust incompatible with modern civilization. Although not yet written, P. B. Shelley's representation of the Furies in Prometheus Unbound  (see I.444), as psychological agents of self-victimization who lacerate the psyche, is wholly in accord with Mary Shelley's conception here.

  This phrasing succinctly captures the closed circle in which the Creature and his creator exist, miserable and incapable of producing anything else but misery. Its terms are as applicable to the speaker as to the object of his hatred, as may be indicated by the simple fact that Victor Frankenstein dies first.

      This speech is closely linked in tone and diction with the point in Victor's narration when, awaiting his trial in Ireland, he resolved on the destruction of his Creature as the sole purpose of his future existence (III:4:43). Once again, we discern language (e.g. "miserable," "wretch"), which was originally applied to the Creature (I:4:2, I:4:3), then thrown back upon Victor by the Creature's taunts (III:7:7), operating as a standard diction for his own self-reference.

    The ironic undertone of identification between Victor and his Creature continues with the implication of how unfortunate it will be should Victor once more be "let loose" upon the world. Here, the term by which Victor first denominated his Creature—wretch (see I:4:2 and note)—which is descended from the Old English word for exile, is expanded to encompass the entire world.

                  <term>miserable wretch </term>
    There is no sharper indication of the way in which doubling patterns operate in this novel than the way in which this term shifts its application as the narrations unfold. The two words are first juxtaposed by Victor as he contemplates his newly vivified Creature (I:4:3). This exact phrase is then employed by the Creature (though, of course, we must recall that in terms of strict chronology, his usage predates that of Victor's narrative), as he tells of his sensations upon awakening on the first night of his existence (II:3:2). Now it is he who applies it to Victor. In its final use Victor, having internalized its truth, will invoke the term, in conversation with Walton, to describe the total failure of his existence (III:Walton:9).

                  <term>miserable wretch </term>
    By this point in the novel's development, these terms have become interchangeably shared by Victor Frankenstein and the Creature. Unconscious of his repetitive language, Victor has named the Creature a "wretch" on first looking at him (see II:4:2) and, again upon seeing him a second time, as the being approaches him across the Sea of Ice (II:2:5). But he likewise refers to himself by the same term in the last sentence of Volume 1 (I:7:33), and Elizabeth characterizes him similarly at the beginning of the second volume (II:1:8).

    Whether impelled by the verb "modelled" (1818) or "moulded" (1831), this is a fascinating phrase. In the second case, although the revised edition lacks the epigraph from Milton's Paradise Lost  that marks the original title page ("Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay / To mould me Man?"—X.743-44 ), Mary Shelley's recast diction seems to recall it with a deliberate irony. In this reconstitution the new Adam, lacking all free will, is animated by his own revenge, which is the pattern, the "mould," established by Satan in Milton's epic.
    <p> On a mundane rather than cosmic level, however, we might want to contemplate what it is to have one's entire emotional life formed by the sentiment of revenge? In accord with the loss of "voluntary thought" mentioned in the previous sentence, Victor also gives up any feeling, any instinctual sense of identification, that might lead him away from his obsessive rage against his double. He thus confesses himself as being wholly shaped, both intellectually and emotionally, by this bond of negation. As he embarks on a pursuit of high adventure, he casts himself, ironically, as a totally passive victim of his own choosing. </p>

    Of all Victor's terms for the being he has brought to life this seems the most directly applicable to a true understanding of the dynamics that underlie the identification of him as monstrous. No longer merely a "monster" in and of himself, here the Creature is designated as being created in such a form. Victor thus tacitly acknowledges his responsibility for making his Creature monstrous, whether in deed or by the mere utterance of the word.

    The undertone in which the text, as Walton reasserts his control over it, questions the statements of its narrators continues here as Walton twice—and in the formulation of a logical proof ("conviction of the truth" . . . "Such a monster has then really existence")—thoughtlessly borrows Victor's diction to describe the Creature. Careful readers will remember that the "apparition . . . seen from our ship" was described very differently at the time (I:L4:3).

    Since the rising of the moon is, like the dawning of the sun, a phenomenon marked almost wholly by its gradual character, the reader can attribute this statement either to Mary Shelley's desire for a gothic  ambience or, more consistent with her art, to Victor's overheated imagination. Since the previous paragraphs have, through the foreshortening of time, already hinted at his surrender to mania, this could be intended as a further example of the slippage of his sense of reality.

 (see I:1:7).
 Although in the 1831 edition her parentage is distanced, she retains this same
 designation of being "more than daughter." The terms recall the rhetoric in
 which she herself, in her dungeon, addressed Justine (see I:7:23).
 Even more so, they echo Victor's own description of her in their youth, in the
 revised 1831 edition (see 1831:I:1:10),
 and thus strongly suggest that there Mary Shelley was attempting to draw together
 these linguistic echoes to emphasize the inbred, almost incestuous, closeness
 of the family. As elsewhere, the echoes may intimate that the bourgeois domestic
 affections are not an unmixed blessing. </p>

    In general terms England  was the center for scientific knowledge in the Europe of the late Enlightenment. A major reason for this was the presence of the Royal Society for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge, founded in 1660 shortly after the restoration of Charles II: its periodical, Philosophical Transactions, was still in Mary Shelley's day the principal scientific journal of the world. The president of the Royal Society at the time of the publication of Frankenstein  was Sir Joseph Banks, one of the great explorers and botanists of the eighteenth century. Although Banks's diverse interests would not have specifically engaged Victor Frankenstein, we can be sure that his example would have been a guiding light for Walton. That of his successor, Sir Humphrey Davy, however, would have equally drawn Victor's admiration, since he was perhaps the premier scientist experimenting with the chemical effects of electricity  in the first quarter of the nineteenth century.

    The oddity of this observation seems to be directly based in Victor's experience as a physiologist.

    The irony of the previous sentence is here almost grotesquely intensified. The being to whom Victor originally gave "life and spirit" was so horribly mutilated in his creation as to provoke universal aversion from all whom he met. Now, in the text, Victor hopes in some way to rectify that lack of initial perspective and clean up either what he once called his "filthy creation" (I:3:9), or lacking success at that aim, at least his own image. The secondary irony is that neither he nor his Creature can expect an individual "posterity" since each has denied the other the possibility of procreation. The posterity that will determine their lasting reputations is thus composed solely of readers of the present text that Victor is so assiduously determined to rewrite.

      These are by no means unfounded fears. The notorious mutiny of Henry Hudson's crew during his fourth voyage to the north in 1611 resulted in the renowned explorer's death. Even so late as his polar exploration of 1829, Sir John Ross experienced a mutiny on one of its ships.

                  <term>to shake off my chains </term>
    This conception of slavery as a psychological as well as physical condition is very much of a piece with other literary productions by the Geneva  circle during the summer of 1816, most particularly The Prisoner of Chillon, written by Lord Byron  in the week after he and Percy Bysshe Shelley  visited the Castle of Chillon during their boat trip around the lake in mid-July. Shelley included an account in the letters  he appended to A History of a Six Weeks' Tour. In Byron's poem, at the end of his long captivity, François de Bonnivard, the prisoner, claims, "It was at length the same to me, / Fetter'd or fetterless to be" (lines 372-73) and ruefully notes, in much the same language as Victor employs here, that "iron is a cankering thing, / For in these limbs its teeth remain, / With marks that will not wear away" (lines 38-40).

    The wrenching shift in narrative stance into a present "now" accentuates the difference subtly in play up to this moment between Victor's self-accusations and his actual avowal of culpability. The man talking to his father knows that he is innocent of the crime for which he is languishing in jail. The one speaking in Walton's cabin nearly three years later, in contrast, has locked the key on his own imprisonment.

      Victor reiterates what he has said before (III:4:43, III:7:5), accentuating the reader's strong sense that he has built a conceptual prison around himself. If the purpose of one's life is solely to bring death to another, then the notion of a vital or life force has been systematically inverted. Such a psychological condition is clearly pathological.

                  <term>what were my duties with regard to this destroyer </term>
    
  "Duty" has been a charged concept throughout Frankenstein, invoked in regard to family affairs, social obligations, legal contracts, uses of knowledge—even, in Victor's rationale for suspending his second creation, the human race. This occasion is different from all the rest, involving the question of what is the moral duty of a human to another sentient but alien being. This assertion of the priority of moral obligation requires willed self-abnegation on Walton's part. No other figure in the novel, certainly not Victor Frankenstein, has ever assumed that the Creature was owed anything.

    Whatever the accruing psychological similarities between Victor and his Creature, this is the first indication that Victor is also growing into his physical counterpart. Perhaps, these signs of death are to be read from a moral perspective, as indicating how deeply implicated with spiritual decay is Victor's retreat from normal human interaction.

                  <term>my fiendish enemy. </term>
    Victor first designates his creature as an "enemy" shortly after his creation (I:4:12), and the Creature, in turn, after the collapse of his aspirations with the DeLacey's thinks of Victor in a like capacity (II:8:30). Throughout this last chapter, however, Victor has conceptualized his Creature wholly in adversarial terms, again and again referring to him as an enemy.

    This is a further instance in which Victor's new level of candor is striking in its unblinking justice. Although it is easy to dismiss this language as characteristically hyperbolic and histrionic, to do so without maintaining a regard for the intensification of his self-understanding would be unjust. The sense of connectedness he now acknowledges with his Creature will become the distinguishing feature of the last movement of the novel.

    As on several earlier occasions in the novel (see I:3:11, I:4:18, I:6:24) the Romantic
    imagination is here connected with inner torment rather than transcendence.
    Instead of regenerating the psychic economy, the imagination preys across
    its isolated and wholly enclosed spaces.

    A less calming letter could scarcely have been written to a fiancée who had not heard from her lover for the better part of two years. Perhaps, Mary Shelley writes with her tongue in her cheek, wishing to stress the strange air of unreality that has become habitual by now with Victor. His idea of "perfect confidence," after all, is to let on that he has a "dreadful" secret and then to require that Elizabeth not ask him a word about it. The irony is lost on him, though one assumes not on the reader. Unfortunately for Elizabeth, she, indeed, never questions him about his odd revelation.

    The supposition with which this graveyard scene commenced has now hardened into conviction. But surely Mary Shelley  emphasizes her irony here, that the sign that Victor's vow has been heard is not some apparition from the dead he would avenge but rather the laugh of the Creature. It is, then, specifically the Creature who reserves Victor's remaining months for vengeance.

                  <term>my wanderings </term>
    Another important theme of the novel and of the age here resonates in Victor's seemingly innocuous phrase. As the Ancient Mariner  of Coleridge  has been invoked on several occasions in the novel, the reader may here wish to see Victor, in his passive surrender to his obsession, as willingly assuming that character's fate. But the idea goes considerably beyond Coleridge's prototype. The notion of the Wandering Jew, cursed to be an eternal vagabond for having taunted Christ on his way to the cross, stands behind both Coleridge's and Mary Shelley's conceptions; and, indeed, that myth may be being evoked here on a particularly subtle level, as Victor's turning his back on his own will to live assumes a psychological counterpart to that taunting of the figure of redemption. The poet figure of Percy Shelley's "Alastor"  (1815), who wanders over some of the same terrain as Victor in search of his visionary love, suggests yet another context. Behind that figure is probably another conceptual avatar, the peddler in Wordsworth's Excursion  (1814) who is explicitly named the Wanderer, and who in that poet's conception is able through his internal poise and just relationship with his natural environment to maintain his balance amid the turbulence of life. Neither of the Shelleys had much respect for that poem, but, needless to say, Victor's balance in contrast to that of Wordsworth's peddler is seriously awry.

                  <p> Although this language may sound proverbial, we are actually witness
      here to the actual occurrence of a cultural transformation into proverbial
      status. The reference is, once again, specifically to Coleridge's "Rime
      of the Ancient Mariner," where
      the dead albatross is hung around the Mariner's neck in the last stanza
      of Part 2, not to be removed until the end of Part 4. Although the overtone
      of Victor's comment is light, it does return us to the isolation of the
      far northern seas where this story is being told and where earlier Coleridge's
    poem was invoked for analogy by Walton (I:L2:6).
    It may also remind us of the morning after the Creature's endowment with
    life (I:4:7) when Victor's sense of being
    haunted first descends on him. </p>

Immersed as he is in irony, Victor does not notice the similarity between his state and that of his Creature.

                  <term>O Night, and by the spirits that preside over thee </term>
    In all conventional mythologies Night is a figure of discord and threat. As she appears in Book I of Spenser's Faerie Queene, she is represented as "griesly Night, with visage deadly sad" (I.5.172), testifying that "I the mother bee/ Of falshood" (I.5.240-41). The eldest of divinities, she has unimpeded access to the depths of Hell. In Paradise Lost  Night dwells with Chaos in the "dark/ Illimitable ocean without bound" (II.891-92) from which God creates Hell. Whatever Victor thinks he is doing by solemnly invoking Night to aid him in his revenge, it is clear, by all traditional associations, that no good will come of it.
    <p> The observant reader may recall that the Creature invoked figures associated with the daytime in swearing before Victor that, if he were given a partner, he would never trouble his maker again (see II:9:17). </p>

  As the Creature laments over Victor, he unwittingly uses language with which we have become familar through Victor's own usage. Here, it is the terminology of destiny. There is, however, an added recognition on his part that the course he embarked on was "willingly chosen," which is an acknowledgement that Victor would have been wont to suppress.

  Mary Shelley  gives her Creature the honor of discovering the North Pole over a century before the first human explorer reached it. She does so, however, not just for the sake of irony, but to complete a figurative line that has spanned the novel from Walton's first letter (I:L1:2) on and has underscored the linkage of Walton and Victor Frankenstein. The Creature, who was brought to life by a fiery electric charge, intends through fire to resign his being into the pure electromagnetic field of the pole.

    Mary Shelley  here achieves a fine balance herself between crediting and subverting the narrative. On the one hand, her readers (not to exclude Walton) have been at the mercy of this autobiographical account for the better course of the novel. Its "connectedness" is in great part what keeps them reading on. Yet there is the lingering hint of madness threading its way through the narrative and impinging on its claims to reliability. That Victor manages to convince Walton of its truth before the actual evidence appears is, in the face of the skepticism he arouses here, rather an achievement. But then, we might wish to remind ourselves that Walton is an habitué of adventure stories and was wont to believe the North Pole a "region of beauty and delight" (I:L1:2).

      It goes without saying that if Margaret Saville hears nothing of her brother's fate, we will never read this novel. Thus, even as Walton is apprehensive about his future, we know that he will survive. This is something more, however, than a conventional expression of fear or a plea for pity, being rather another instance of Mary Shelley's accentuating the instability of her text and the innumerable contingencies surrounding all authorship, whether we think of the result as her novel or Victor's Creature.

    Mary Shelley's concentration on this issue brings the reader to an awareness that, where an entire culture refuses to believe in the truth of the aberrant, it may appear mad even when it is not technically so. Or, as the British psychoanalyst of the 1970s, R. D. Laing, tried to argue, it is possible to believe that those we call mad are merely reacting sanely to the inherently mad stresses forced upon them by modern civilization. It is those who have no awareness of them who truly constitute the mad. In this case the public position of those who seem to value Victor's intellectual integrity but dismiss his self-accusations, first Mr. Kirwin and then his own father, allows us to read them as representatives of a reigning cultural establishment that, however well-meaning it may be, may at the same time appear willfully blind.

    Catherine Nugent was the landlady with whom Percy Bysshe Shelley  and his first wife Harriet  resided during their short visit to Dublin  in the spring of 1812. Both the Shelleys maintained a correspondence with her thereafter. The fact that Harriet, not Percy Shelley, informed Catherine Nugent of the rupture of their marriage suggests, perhaps, that of the two she felt the closer ties. Mary Shelley, however, never met Catherine Nugent, and there is no reference to her anywhere in her writings or in her husband's correspondence with her. Thus, the presence of the surname Nugent in this novel comes as something of a surprise that has never been explained.

    Walton is taking very seriously the notion of the living dead whom Victor accounted a "guiding spirit" (III:7:26 and note) as he embarked on the Arctic ice fields. Yet what he appears to be telling his sister and her readers here is that Victor's only solace is in madness, and that for so deeply alienated a creature madness is preferable to sanity. If by this statement he is recognizing that Victor is actually mad, it raises considerable questions about what constitutes the truth contained by either narrative—Victor's, certainly, but also his own which relies exclusively on Victor's for its authority.

    Here, as Victor recognizes how wholly inverted was truth from expectation, the ironies become heavy indeed, for, however extreme his rhetoric, he seems wholly unconscious that this is the fate he has bestowed upon his Creature. And given that what he utters here comes with the burden of a sudden shift to the total retrospect of Walton's cabin, he seems strangely unable to acknowledge that this is the fate he has bestowed upon himself as well. From a few days after the marriage onward, Victor does, in fact, desert Switzerland  for ever to pursue the Creature far and wide across national borders, the two of them sharing a state of permanent "exile."

    The powerless of this unlanded peasant before the forces of state power probably reflects the devastation of Europe during the last phase of the Napoleonic Wars. However self-serving or self-pitying we may find Victor's comparison, its political edge is unmistakable and is perhaps intended by Mary Shelley, like other incidental political observations in the novel, to insinuate a viewpoint that could not be explicitly stated in the political climate of England  in 1818.

    The "then" reveals Victor distancing himself from the sense that there will be any immediate consequences to his act. His susceptibility to dismiss, or just miss, the logical point, however, is not so much the result of chronic thick-headedness as it is the effect of the egotism through which he filters all experience. His characteristic assignment of a "destiny" to himself likewise testifies as much to his sense of self-importance as to the determinism by which he attempts to deflect moral responsibility for his actions from himself.

The city is located on the river Tay some twenty miles southwest of Dundee, where Mary Shelley spent nearly two years -- from June 1812 to March 1814 -- at the home of the Baxter family. </p>

    After the various kinds of mental deterioration Victor has suffered in the later chapters, it may come as something of a relief to acknowledge that he is still as scientifically alert to the representations of physiognomy as he was shen he dismissed Dr. Krempe's credentials on that basis (see I:2:12).

  This may seem a strange usage, but it accords with the primary meaning of "remorse" in Mary Shelley's day. Johnson's Dictionary  (1755) lists the following two definitions:
  <list type="simple">
                     <item>Pain of guilt </item>
                     <item>Tenderness; pity; sympathetick sorrow </item>
                  </list>
  In both cases, but particularly in the first, remorse involves a passionate suffering that could be likened to the action of poison.

    This curious phrase recalls us to the last colloquy between Victor and his Creature after the destruction of Victor's second being. There, asserting his mastery over Victor, the Creature claims that he will attain this "power" (III:3:11), which is that of reducing Victor to the state of utter wretchedness he has now reached.

                  <p> Bearing in mind the previous paragraph's emphasis on Alphonse's fears for his son's mental stability, we may see this careful planning between father and fiancée as reflecting a shared concern that Victor not be left alone to indulge what they see as a tendency toward melancholy, or, in his own characterization, "lonely, maddening reflection." Even his seemingly innocent adjective here ("maddening") takes on added weight in the depiction of Clerval as a kind of chaperon to ensure the preservation of Victor's mental balance. </p>

    is once again brought to the fore. Once again, Victor intrudes the notion
    of a "tale," a word used by him (I:L4:28, I:3:13)
    and by the Creature (II:2:13, II:2:16,
    II:9:18) to describe their narratives,
    also (with a different construction of what might constitute the truth) in
    the last sentence of the novel's Preface.

                  <term>the herd of common projectors </term>
    "Projector" is a term commonly used in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries to refer to inventors, often in a pejorative sense. Its ambivalence of connotation is reflected in the double primary meaning assigned to it by the Oxford English Dictionary: 
    a. One who forms a project, who plans or designs some enterprise or undertaking; a founder.
    <p> b. In invidious use: A schemer; one who lives by his wits; a promoter of bubble companies; a speculator, a cheat. </p>
  Samuel Johnson  is, if anything, less evenhanded in the double definition of "projector" contained in his 1755 Dictionary: 
    1. One who forms schemes or designs.
    <p> 2. One who forms wild impracticable schemes. </p>
    Perhaps the most famous literary account of projectors is that offered by Jonathan Swift  in Gulliver's tour through the Grand Academy of Lagado (Gulliver's Travels, III.5), a think-tank populated by inventors of perfectly useless or insane conceptions and contraptions.
    <p> Victor Frankenstein's desire to separate himself from madmen and hacks is thus easily justifiable, whether we construe it in accord with his ambition or his achievement. Yet, the tone of condescension in his phrasing is expressive of an arrogance and self-approbation that verges on universal contempt. Its natural complement in a social dimension would be a hierarchical rigidity denominated according to class, and in a psychological field the prejudice we customarily comprehend under the rubric of racism. In other words, there is an easy shift from this self-esteem to the denigration of the Other expressed by Victor's continual demonization of his Creature. </p>

    Since Victor and Clerval had not left London until the end of March, and as they had "passed a considerable period at Oxford" and "two months in Cumberland and Westmoreland," not
    to mention the time spent in this lengthy journey northward, it should now
    be early in July, which is to say, almost a year after Victor's promise to
    his Creature.


 His pattern of attenuated delays throughout the novel is particularized in an earlier

    The matter-of-fact tone in which Victor speaks here clothes in euphemistic objectivity, and seems meant to cushion, a remarkable statement. A person who "often" over a period of a few weeks attempts to commit suicide, in general terms, would be considered seriously deranged.

    The syntax is somewhat confusing. Falkland  and Gower/Goring  are mentioned as companions to King Charles I, whose queen was Henrietta Maria (1609-69)—actually Henriette-Marie, daughter of Henry IV of France and Marie de Medici, by birth and practice a Roman Catholic. The son mentioned here probably would be Charles II  (1630-85; restored after the Commonwealth as king of Great Britain and Ireland, 1660-85); but the term could as easily apply to his slightly younger brother James II (1633-1701), who became king after the death of Charles II but was deposed three years later, in 1688, in what became known as the Bloodless Revolution.

    At this point Victor's demonizing of his Creature extends into a primitive form of racism, transforming a personal vendetta into a supposedly objective ideology that stamps this Other as inherently inferior, incapable of civilization, and undeserving of existence. Thus positioning himself at an extreme of self-righteous justification, Victor will fall back upon this hardened, docrinaire authority for all his subsequent actions concerning the Creature.

    It requires but a moment's pause over this bland statement of relief, particularly
    in conjunction with Victor's fears, expressed at the beginning of the chapter,
    about propagating a race of devils (see III:3:2 and note) to realize that
    its premise is a blatant racism. Mary Shelley represents it without any underscoring,
    all the more suggestive of how inherent is the thinking, how psychologically
    embedded the attitude.

                  <term>the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion </term>
    
  Rage has appeared such an emotional constant of this novel that the reader may be surprised in reflection to realize that the emotion never occurs in Volume 1, but enters the space of the fiction in the encounter of the Creature and Victor Frankenstein on the Mer-de-Glace  of Mont Blanc. There the figure embroiled in rage is Victor (II:2:5). In the Creature's own narration something like this present unrestrained rage occurs when he burns down the cottagers' house (II:8:12). Thereafter, the novel evinces a smoldering fire, ready to burst into flame at any point: we witness it in the successive "rage" that grips Victor (II:9:3) and the Creature (II:9:6) over the question of the creation of a companion. Beginning with chapter 3 of the third volume, rage is an abiding emotion of Victor Frankenstein's, concomitant with the fever that wastes his body. Now that he is dead, it is as if that violent emotion were floating free of his body, the sole evidence of the bond driving both these figures to their destruction. It is notable that the rage inhabiting the Creature is not against Victor but himself.

                  <term>real insanity possessed me </term>
    It is easy to overlook the weight of this statement, but "real" should be
    given its due meaning. Following the accounts of Victor's attempted suicide
    (III:4:46)
    and his father's questioning earlier in this chapter whether his son was
    not actually mad, (III:5:5)
    these symptoms, an alteration between violent rage and withdrawn lethargy,
    point to a serious manic-depressive condition. For Elizabeth this has to
    be extraordinarily trying: the depressed state Victor was in when he had
    left her, both upon undertaking the excursion to Chamounix (II:1:10 and
    II:1:14) and in the aftermath of his encounter with the Creature (III:1:1), had
    been serious enough, but the extremity into which it has developed hardly
    bodes well for her future with him. Even so, Elizabeth reverts to her characteristic
    vocation of nurse.

    The uncanny coincidences by which Victor comes upon the scene of Clerval's death, as if enmeshed in a logic over which he has no control, reinforce his larger sense that he has no independent will to exercise in his life's narrative. These coincidences may likewise remind us of the crucial role played by narrative, or having a firm control over interpretation of the narrative, throughout the novel.

    As in his initial creation Victor's impulse is to deny humanity to the being he would endow with life. What most deeply plagues his mind is the fact that his creation will be beyond his control. In a theological extension of this concern, the question before the creator is whether the new race, particularly the female member of it, can be trusted to exercise free will.

  The Creature is an acute reader of his own history, aware that amid his accumulated experiences of victimization some cases were freer than others from any possible mitigation. He concentrates here on the two instances (see II:7:38 and II:8:19) where his own disinterested benevolence was rewarded with a violent attack on his person. For all Victor's repeated threats to grapple with his Creature, it is interesting to observe that after his creation he never again physically touches him.

      Walton, who cannot resist the impulse to continue a creation whose end he cannot predict, bears an uncanny resemblance to the obsessive Victor Frankenstein racing to the denouement of the Creature's birth in Ingolstadt  (I:3:8). The difference, and it is one maintained throughout the novel's self-reflexive mirroring of its own operations, is that writing has no effect in the world until it is read. The writer's obsession with the text may seem both narcissistic and solipsistic, but this antisocial dimension is confined to a conceptual plane. Still, Walton's unselfconscious acquiescence in the claims of what seems to him irresistable reinforces our sense that what drives Victor is little different from the passions we all share as human beings.

    Remorse is by no means an unalloyed virtue in Enlightenment usage, as Johnson's definition of it makes clear. Contemporary literary usage had, indeed, suggested that this was a tragic passion. Coleridge's Remorse, which was produced in 1813, represents the passion as a static rankling, and Byron, who had a hand in bringing that tragedy to the stage at Drury Lane, recasts its essential situation into the unavailing grief of Manfred.

    Perhaps this statement is meant to remind us that, though Victor was originally repelled by the "repulsive countenance" of Krempe, the chemistry professor at the University  of Ingolstadt  (see I:2:9), in time he came to treasure "his sound sense and real information," however much he was still aware of their being "combined . . . with a respulsive physiognomy" (I:3:1). Obviously, however, what Victor can tolerate in a human constrained by the normative boundaries of inherited genetic combination he is unwilling to extend to his Creature, who is a being of whom, from the first, he claimed "no mortal could support the horror of that countenance" (I:4:4), a being who himself, upon first seeing his reflection, "started back" from his "miserable deformity" (II:4:13). Victor's magnanimous identification with his fellow beings collapses here under the weight of the ironies of a categorical discrimination he seems unable to comprehend.

    Leigh Hunt's Story of Rimini  (1816) recounts the legendary love of Francesca da Rimini and her brother-in-law, Paolo Malatesta, which is found in Dante's Inferno  (5.73-138), in a style at once richly textured like a medieval tapestry and linguistically contemporary. His explanation for the illicit love was that the youthful Francesca was married to Paolo as a stand-in for his haughty older brother and fell in love with him at first sight. This quotation comes from the beginning of Canto 2, after the groom's elaborate wedding party arrives with the surrogate Paolo as "the very poetry of nature" (2.47) to fetch the bride. In 1815  Hunt had become something of a mentor to both Mary Godwin  and Percy Bysshe Shelley, and he was to remain one of their warmest friends. Indicative of how close this circle was, Hunt's Story of Rimini  was dedicated to Lord Byron.

    Even as Victor demonized his Creature and surrounded his second creation with imaginings of the direst consequences, it is clear that in the ensuing months he has inflated this act of destruction of the second being, transforming what appeared at the time as an act of passionate homicide into a gesture of sublime heroism offered in behalf of all of humankind. It is small wonder Alphone Frankenstein changes the subject: such apparent delusions of grandeur are highly suspect.

    A realistic perspective on this evidence might emphasize the fact that, since both the Creature's and Victor's boats are Scottish in make, they would therefore in all probability resemble one another closely. But Mary Shelley  seems to have another purpose in mind. Having already forced an aura of the uncanny upon this scene through the great distance of travel and coincidence of destination of her characters, she subtly reinforces the interchangeability of Creature and creator that will progressively intensify as the novel moves towards its conclusion.

  Characteristic of the structural ingenuity of Frankenstein, its final scene is a recollected flashback. Chronologically speaking, this brief paragraph, with its self-reflexiveness about its own artistic imperatives and capacities, constitutes something of a final bow, the last words of a novel that, from end to end, has held a mirror up to its own operations as a primary example of the creation that is its theme.

    If the terms in which Victor recounts his regaining a sense of responsibility cannot easily be reconciled with a disinterested ethics, one senses in this phrase a tone of self-accusation reflecting a more mature understanding of his own implication in the catastrophic events he has unleashed. This acceptance of responsibility is not uniform, returning only sporadically in the later chapters of the novel, but it testifies, perhaps, to a measure of moral growth; or, if Victor's vindictive diction places that conclusion in some doubt, at least to a sharper sense of the price that has been paid for his solitary ambition and withdrawal from normative human interactions. Still, suspecting that Victor's self-important posture as family protector will only eventuate in great calamities, a reader may find it hard not to cast an ironic eye upon what continue as usual to be good intentions never sufficiently thought through.

 of the mid-first century, Seneca was also a playwright, whose nine tragedies
 celebrate stoic resignation. As a statesman, his practice was anything but what
 such a philosophical stance might indicate, for he was an activist not a conservative.
 He was Nero's tutor and later acted behind the scenes to secure the emperor's
 power. He retired from the court in the year 62 to devote himself to philosophy,
 but three years later he was denounced as taking part in the conspiracy of Piso
 against the emperor. Ordered by Nero to commit suicide, Seneca took his own
 life with stoic resignation and fortitude. It is not, it would appear, in Seneca's
 writings but in his example that Walton looks for comfort in his peril.</p>

    Victor is here being characterized as the ideal "man of feeling," in accord with Enlightenment cultural standards of a kind associated with the writings of Rousseau and, in English, Adam Smith. With the latter, see particularly The Theory of Moral Sentiments, 3.2-3.3, 5.2, and 6.3.

    Officially exonerated as he has been by his trial in the previous chapter, Victor nonetheless carries a profound psychological sense that he has been convicted in the court in which his destiny has been plotted and that there is no escaping the sentence. That he totally misreads the result, however, is sufficient commentary on the "necessity" under which he feels he labors.

      A week has elapsed since Walton's last entry in the letter to his sister, a notable absence in a time frame that has been previously so overcharged with event. The dating makes comparison almost inevitable, and the reader thus becomes conscious of the curious fact that the entirety of Victor's narration of his life took one day less than this week-long lacuna in which the late-summer ice has slowly but inexorably been heaved by the pressures of wind and sea into threatening mountains. The natural landscape, as is so often the case with Mary Shelley's treatment of the sublime Arctic wilderness, has a corollary in the psychological development of her characters, particularly in the nexus of guilt and destiny driving Victor.

                  <p>In 1818 the compositor, evidently reading this as one in a series of journal
  entries, surmised that it could not follow "September 12th" and added an integer
  to make it "September 19th." But, of course, what the text intends us to understand
  by its idiom is, "On September 9th the ice began to move." Since this is the
  date in the manuscript and it is restored in 1831, the text has been emended
  here. </p>

                  <term>the latter days of </term>
    The text printed in 1818 has "latter days of December," which is clearly
    a compositor's error unnoticed in the Shelleys' proofreading of the text
    for the first edition. The mistake, once in print, went unnoticed in all
    later editions of the novel. In Mary Shelley's draft, however, the word is
    unmistakably "September." She would have had every reason to adhere to this
    timeline since, just a few weeks earlier than her fictional schedule, in
    1814, it took the Shelley party nine days to cover the distance between Basel
    and Rotterdam (30 August-7 September) travelling exactly as do Victor Frankenstein
    and Henry Clerval and, even when adverse conditions delayed their departure
    from Holland, a three days' crossing brought them to London on 13 September
    (see Six Weeks' Tour  for Switzerland  and Holland).
    <p> The attenuated journey of the 1818 text is whittled to three months in
      the shifting of the original departure date in 1831, which, as indicated earlier,
      may have been done to accommodate the timespan after Victor's return from
      Mont Blanc rather than his arrival date in England. In the next chapter,
      as recorded in both the 1818 and 1831 texts, the chronology reverts to
      a normative calendar and Victor observes that he and Clerval "had arrived
      in England at the beginning of October" (III:2:5). </p>

                  <term>the shadow of a human being </term>
    Although this phrase is meant to underscore the precarious state of Victor's physical health, it resonates within a psychological and moral construction as well, once again reminding us of how like the state of his Creature Victor's has become. The Creature functions as a shadow, not just in the modern sense of trailing Victor wherever he goes, but also in his incapacity ever to assume a full human dimension. Victor, in his isolation and his chronic sense of undiscriminating guilt, has also forsaken that dimension. In the late chapters of the novel Victor's physical condition is, as here, a measure of his psychic state.

  Although there are shrieks of fear or anger here and there across this novel's landscape, this is the only shout heard in Frankenstein. The intense silence of the novel, indeed, is a remarkable stylistic achievement. The noisy enthuasiasm of the sailors may remind us of Victor's recent recollection of how the Greek soldiers wept for joy upon reencountering the sea when they returned from Persia (III:7:17). The naturalness of the mariners' response stands in paradoxical contrast with Victor's sense of transcendental empowerment. It is little wonder that he should be awakened from his sleep by the threat simple humanity poses against his aims.

                  <term>I shut my eyes involuntarily </term>
    
  These two sentences encapsulate a highly complex aesthetic and moral act. It is against his will that Walton closes his eyes; yet with eyes closed he occupies an essentially different space from that in which he first viewed the Creature a second before. He has unwittingly placed himself in the position of the elder DeLacey, who is the only stranger not to have rejected the Creature at first sight (II:7:18). DeLacey's blindness and Walton's closed eyes remove from their judgments the beautiful as a determining aesthetic criterion. With its absence each is able to act on what purports to be an objective moral plane, or at least not to have pre-determined aesthetic categories prejudice their responses. Paradoxically, an act that is reflexive and therefore deterministic in its inception becomes the means by which unexamined, normative standards of behavior, which are truly deterministic in their impulse, can be transcended, allowing an exercise of free will. Since Walton is not actually blind, his act in its ethical import is unique for the novel.

    The villagers one and all reduce the being whom Victor has been anathematizing
    as a daemon to human proportions. In this they seem cast in the same mold
    as Walton's lieutenant who, after the initial appearance of the Creature,
    stolidly questions Victor about the "man" he has been pursuing (I:L4:11).

                  <term>a sister or a brother </term>
    
      In terms of Mary Shelley's biography, this may be a revealing, if somewhat odd, statement. Mary Shelley was the sole child of William Godwin  and Mary Wollstonecraft, conceived before they were officially married and then left motherless by Wollstonecraft's death. She had three step-siblings: Fanny Imlay, the daughter of Mary Wollstonecraft and the American Gilbert Imlay, who committed suicide in 1817  while Mary was still engaged in the writing of Frankenstein; and Charles and Claire Clairmont, children of the first marriage of Godwin's second wife Mary Jane Clairmont. Because of their gender and nearness of age, Mary and Claire were thrown much together and experienced considerable sibling friction. Claire's unacknowledged pregnancy by Lord Byron  was the driving force behind the 1816  journey to Geneva, and when her condition became known it fell largely to Mary to see her through the pregnancy without scandal. From this point on, for the next five years, Claire lived with the Shelleys both in England  and Italy. Whatever words Victor speaks here, it is clear that Mary's closeness to her step-sister generally increased the suspiciousness with which she regarded Claire's motives and actions.

  The Creature reverts to the terms of his last confrontation of Victor Frankenstein, when he called Victor his slave and demanded his obedience (III:3:11 and note). The effect of this recantation, however, is not so much the simple reversal the diction connotes, as an erasure of the polarizing of his terms. Both he and Victor were slaves, mastered alike by their antagonism.

                  <p> The new terminology for Victor's relationship with the Creature, introduced
      four paragraphs earlier (III:1:9),
      returns with augmented stress. The underlying notion of slavery includes
      not just bondage but an absence of willed responsibility. Victor thus appears
      to be distancing himself from his recognition of the awesome obligations
      of a deity with which the second volume closed (II:9:18). </p>

It also considerably darkens the construction of what Victor sees as his destiny, also of how he comprehends the nature of imitative behavior, for he appears to think it achieved not through emulation but, rather, through the exercise of coercion.</p>

                  <term>smooth and placid as a southern sea </term>
    
      Victor's only experience of a southern sea would appear to have come at the beginning of this last trip in pursuit of the Creature, embarked on from a French Mediterranean  port (III:7:9). On its surface his sardonic comment roundly indicts the crew for moral and spiritual laxity. Yet, on second thought, an even stronger counterforce ironically deflates the surface terms. This ironic inversion begins as we recognize the considerable negative connotations from earlier in the novel already adhering to this celebration of the "glorious" (I:L1:6 and note, I:L2:3 and note, and III:Walton:6 and note). On top of those resonances, the reference to "a southern sea" should remind the knowledgeable reader of the last voyage undertaken by Ulysses and his crew in search of glory, a voyage that took them far into the unknown southern sea where their ship foundered. This is the subject of Canto 26  of Dante's Inferno, which is likewise the source upon which Tennyson depended for his dramatic monologue, "Ulysses," written in 1833. In Dante's rendition of this story, for all his heroic posturing, Ulysses has led his men to their death for nothing beyond a meaningless personal glory. For this act of essential treachery he is lodged near the bottom of hell for eternity.
      <p> It is worth remarking that, in her draft of this passage, Mary Shelley  originally wrote "summer lake," and the phrase "southern sea" was inserted above it in P. B. Shelley's hand. This interpolation, of course, would have had to have been agreed to by Mary Shelley, presumably after some discussion of the appropriateness of the intertextual context the phrase evokes. </p>

    A year after the Creature's long narration beneath Mont Blanc  and after several chapters devoted to Victor's egocentric ruminations in the interim, we are here sharply reminded of the Creature's inner life that Victor refuses to acknowledge. In modern parlance the Creature is engaged at this point in a deliberate repression of his anger. As in their previous encounter Victor notably outrants his Creature.

                  <p> Although, of course, Victor will need to pursue his scientific labors
      by himself, the verb "coveted" conveys a sense of profound asociality as
      a crucial aspect of Victor's constitution. However eagerly he expresses
      his anticipation of returning to find fulfillment in his union with Elizabeth,
      what his father praises as "our domestic calm"  at this point in the 1818 edition seems
      wholly to lack the capacity to satisfy Victor.</p>

                  <term>wishing for some mighty revolution </term>
    Victor's desire for an externally applied apocalyptic solution that will break the logical circle he cannot escape is as characteristic of him as the passivity into which he actually retreats from the stress of events. Still, his figure resonates against his contrasting application of the turning wheel a few paragraphs earlier (see III:4:12 and note), where its every revolution was conceived as bringing new calamities upon him.
    <p> The term "mighty revolution" cannot but retain some of its political charge in the context of post-Napoleonic Europe, particularly if connected to the world of undiscriminated wretchedness that Victor had been contemplating before Mr. Kirwin entered to prepare him for his father's arrival (III:4:21). </p>

    The character of the "guiding spirit" (III:7:17) is darkened even more by this representation of the walking dead hovering around Victor and encouraging his desperate venture into a world of death. Although such macaberie is conventional to the gothic  mode, its psychological impress here is new and startling.

    The context strongly suggests that it is the ever-watchful Creature who is sustaining Victor's life throughout his long voyage, not the heaven-directed spirits that Victor imagines. Thus, this phrase is heavily weighted with irony. The irony is in fact attenuated, for Mary Shelley  could not have written this phrase without consciousness of P.B. Shelley's title, "Alastor, or the Spirit of Solitude,"  the poem he published in 1816, three months before the excursion to Lake Geneva. An alastor  in Greek is an evil spirit.

    Two paragraphs before Victor hypothesized the active intervention of the spirit world on his behalf. By this point he has convinced himself that he is under their protection. This is a further example of how in the last pages of his narration Victor moves further and further beyond the boundaries of a normative rationality.

  This is the second time that Walton has referred to Victor Frankenstein as "glorious." Although less obviously allusive to Milton's characterization of Satan in Paradise Lost  than the earlier reference (III:Walton:6 and note; see also I:L4:22), the verbal repetition serves to underscore with some finality the parallel with the fallen archangel.

    As the chapter continues the tentative "seems" of the shadow cast by the dead is sharpened by Victor into a certainty. The dead become the enablers of his action and he sees himself increasingly as acting upon their behalf. Again, Mary Shelley's psychological portrait here is subtly telling: a person who has given up all sense of individual will has surrendered the central principal of vitality and may, indeed, be considered to have become an agent of death.

    Mary Shelley's readers might easily construe the storm as merely providing a conventional Gothic atmosphere in which to wrap the suspense of this long-awaited evening. But the storm functions more specifically as a leitmotif associated with the sublime  power of nature, of forces beyond human control, and of the Creature. There actually are only two such Gothic storms in Frankenstein. The first was also set in the environs of Lake Geneva  and occured as Victor, returning from Ingolstadt, sought out the scene of his brother William's death at Plainpalais. There in a brilliant flash of lightning he encountered the form of his Creature for the first time since the night of its creation. That scene in the sixth chapter in the first volume (I:6:20) thus operates as a symmetrical counterpart to this other storm of the sixth chapter of the third volume, anticipating the reemergence of the Creature into Victor's domestic idyll.

    Doubtless, Victor, who has in numerous critical situations been unwilling to explain his case for fear of not being believed, worries about how he can convey his deposition so as to produce conviction. Yet, once again, the language reminds us that we are in the midst of a narrative whose truth is totally dependant on the veracity of the narrator. Victor likewise makes much of its internal consistency to Walton as he begins the narration (I:L4:30). What this detail adds is the realization that Victor's is truly what Nathaniel Hawthorne termed a "twice-told tale," having, with the exception of its final chapter, been already rehearsed in the judge's chamber. The reiteration of such a tale of fatally transgressed boundaries recalls the context provided by the same sort of obsessive repetition in Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner."

The two would then proceed north by boat through Germany into Holland where the Rhine empties into the North Sea  just beyond Rotterdam. This is essentially the return route followed by Mary Godwin and Percy Shelley in their 1814  excursion memorialized in A History of a Six Weeks' Tour.</p>

    Mary Shelley's diction indicates how deliberately she has plotted these "strange chances" to seem beyond the ordinary expectations of causality, whether in a human or a novelistic sphere. Such uncanny events are, however, a customary feature of the gothic novel, and it is at points like this that one feels that the author fully recognizes the heritage she is exploiting.

    Although Victor is self-evidently no match in strength with his creature,
    he continually looks to a melodramatic struggle-to-the-death to resolve their
    conflict, thus substituting a simply physical resolution for one that might
    embody ethical or psychological justice. Once again, one may read here a
    female author's sense of the conventions of masculinist fictions, whether
    those of art or real life. (For other instances where Victor similarly falls
    back on physical competitiveness, see II:2:5, II:2:6, III:3:16 and III:3:17).

  Victor's complete self-contradiction in his last moments mirrors the novel's ambivalence over the conflicting claims of domestic retreat and aspiring self-assertion, which are in turn poles that themselves comprise a dialectical field over which Romanticism continually expresses much ambivalence. The particular terms of Victor's last utterance have a somewhat chilling effect: at what, a reader may well wonder, does Victor contemplate another's success? If in the realm in which he has failed, assuming the role of God, we may envision from Victor's experience a greater, even a catastrophic, failure. Even as he moves linguistically to open up possibility, the lingering effects of his example resist his optimism.

    The reader who has overheard the Creature's narrative—particularly his claim that "misery made me a fiend" (see II:2:11 and note)—may view this generalized platitude with a more sharply focussed perspective than Victor brings to bear on it. As is so often the case, he misses the connnection between his experiences and those of the being he created.

    In other words, what human society allows into its purview is no longer the factor by which Victor judges his actions.

    Does Mary Shelley  intend us to see a comparison or a total contrast with Safie, who uses virtually the same words to explain how she escaped her father in Leghorn  and made it north to the De Lacey's cottage in Germany? That episode, impelled by love, occurs at the center and southern extremity of the novel; Victor, in this last chapter of his narrative, stands near its outer edge and sets out for the far north driven by a hatred that in its passion and compulsion seems a mirror reflection of Safie's desire: see II:6:19.
    <p> The statement also contains a second bearing, which is that, although it is not explicitly mentioned by Victor, with the demise of Alphonse Frankenstein, Victor, as first-born son, has inherited the family estate and can spend his inheritance in whatever fashion he chooses. No longer need he follow his father's admonition to attend a university (see I:2:1) or ask his permission to travel to the British Isles (see III:1:11). In effect, Victor is now the patriarch of his family. </p>

    The context seems to take the reader back to the May afternoon two and a half years earlier when Victor and Henry Clerval returned from their happy perambulations in the region of Ingolstadt  to find Alphonse Frankenstein's letter describing William's death. Such innocent pleasure in natural renewal, Victor asserts, is no longer possible for him (see I:5:17).

    Victor's emotional instability is underscored by this sudden excess of sensibility. That his rekindled joy will soon be transformed into the despair his isolation in the boat had prefigured is indicative of the irony in which, from the point in which he spurned his Creature's desire for sympathetic rapport, he finds himself invested. Later, hope will come to him in a "burning gush" of ironically inverted expectation (III:7:22).

    Even as Victor thinks of himself as reacting with compassion to the assumed plight of Elizabeth, it is clear to any reader that he is actually weeping for himself. His giving in at last to his feelings is thus ironized, for rather than opening him to a renewal of his emotional life, his convulsive weeping results from a maudlin theatrical representation of his own death that wholly mistakes the threat to his future wife.

    Characteristically, Victor construes Elizabeth's state of health in reference to himself. At the age of twenty-two she should not be so beyond her prime. Clearly, worry over the last two years has taken its toll. Although Mary Shelley  maintains her undeviating focus on Victor, this momentary description illuminates the cost of his obsession and detachment from Elizabeth on her state of mind and body. This is as close to an inner life as Elizabeth ever manifests.

    Mary Shelley quotes lines 76-83  of the last poem in the 1798 Lyrical Ballads  by Wordsworth  and Coleridge, changing first person pronouns to the third person ("or" in line 83 was regularized by Wordsworth to "nor" only in 1836). The quotation of these celebrated lines about natural inspiration underscores the association of Henry Clerval with the Romantic poet, and more specifically, might recall Byron's remark that Percy Shelley  "dosed" him with Wordsworth during the summer of 1816.

    Another conspicuous feature of the final chapter is introduced here. Although we are close to having completed the narrative circle, returning to Walton's voice part way through this chapter, the continual shift of time frames does more than remind us of this impending closure. The sudden confrontation of past and future in a sentence such as this also serves implicitly to suggest that at the point where Victor locked himself into the hermetically sealed enclosure of his obsession, time began to lose its normative distinctions.

  Walton's metaphor is prescient, since it is by fire that the Creature plans
  to consume himself (III:Walton:45).
  It is no coincidence but an extensive of the metaphor that Victor appears to

    On the complex moral spectrum laid out by this novel Victor here engages in the equivalent of murder. His destructive burst of passion and pointed denial of humanity to the object of his creation, which he calls a thing, reduce him at least to the moral level of the Creature, who at this point has likewise been guilty of one murder.

  Having been created over a long period of time, then brought to life, the Creature has passed the nearly six years of his existence being recreated in an inverse, indeed, a negative manner. He describes it as viscerallly painful, a creation without anesthesia. The violent negation of his original being is a corollary to the way in which hatred replaced love as his bond with Victor Frankenstein.

    In regard to this curious reminder of the present tense in which Victor narrates
    the story of his life, it is important to recall that, far from being Victor's
    junior, Walton is 28 years old at this point in the account, one year older
    than Victor. A useful point of comparison is the exchange between the simple
    Chamois Hunter and Manfred in the second act of Byron's Manfred,
    the dramatic poem he began in the summer of 1816 and set in the same Alpine
    wilderness as the second volume of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.

    Although Clerval has just been described as like a "former self" to Victor, the difference between them involves more than the effect of experience on each man's sense of well-being. Victor is, in effect, living a lie, and his lack of openness to Clerval is the actual wedge by which their division is being enforced.

    When Ixion, king of Thessaly, fell in love with Hera, Zeus punished him for his effrontery by binding him to a wheel in Hades that revolved in perpetuity. In notable instances in the English literary tradition the mode of Ixion's torture is reconceptualized in psychological terms. Mary Shelley  would surely have been familiar with King Lear's portrayal of himself as "bound/ Upon a wheel of fire" (IV.vii.46-47). It could well be that her own image influenced Percy Shelley's employment of the same figure in Prometheus Unbound  (see I.139-42).

    It has been less than three years since Victor Frankenstein had been seized
    with a similar "nervous fever" that, after the creation of his being, confined
    him for months (see I:4:17 and note). Mary Shelley emphasizes how severely
    debilitated his physical state has become as a result of the acute psychological
    stress under which he has been laboring and from which no amount of diversion
    can seem to liberate him.

    Victor's constant attention to his unavoidable fate is at least partly to be construed, at this point in the discourse, as a justification for the blindness with which he worried so exclusively about himself, leaving Elizabeth unprotected. But it falls in line as well with his reiterated invocation of destiny during this narration to Walton, a rhetorical ploy by which, whether or not it is his explicit intention, he exonerates himself of acknowledged responsiblity for the events his actions produce.

    Victor's self-consciousness as to his effect as narrator shadows this deposition of his case, both for the magistrate and for Mary Shelley's readers. We cannot help recognizing here that the end of a novel is to make fiction appear like truth. That Victor in the end does not gain the credence of his judge does, of course, vindicate his earlier reticence; but it also in some sense impinges on his reliability as a witness. Does it also have a destabilizing effect on the larger narrative of which it is a microcosm?

    Again, as in his shock over the mistreatment of Justine Moritz in the first
    volume (I:7:30), Victor's innate sense of decency is evoked to complicate
    our recognitions: in this particular case, that his own medical carelessness
    was implicit in his creation of a being with monstrous features who could
    not function within a conventional social format (I:3:7) and that his uncaring
    brutality has been recently marked in the wanton destruction of the second
    creature on whom he had been working in the preceding chapter (III:3:4).

  With his "hand . . . stretched out, seemingly to detain" his double, the Creature replicates the gesture in which he first appeared before Victor's eyes, in his bedroom in Ingolstadt  (I:4:3). The reaction of Walton to his monstrous presence is in stark contrast to that evinced on that previous occasion by his creator.

    Beginning with this phrase, the last chapter of Victor's long narration starts a subtle recapitulation and intensification of the overarching themes of his discourse.

He is now locking himself within the dyad of his adversarial relation with the Creature.

    Victor ironically echoes the reflection of the Creature, as he contemplates
    the domestic happiness of the De Lacey household, on his contrasting solitude.
    The diction the Creature used at the point—"no Eve soothed my sorrows"—would
    suggest that it was then that he began to conceive the plan for a mate that
    here comes to a disastrous conclusion. (See II:7:11).

    The 1818 text at this point stipulates that "nearly a year had elapsed" since this journey had begun from Geneva, a period the 1831 text identifies as "the latter end of September." (There is a month's disparity between the two texts on this point—see III:1 in 1818 and 1831). In her revision of the novel Mary Shelley, desiring to underpin the professional engagement of Henry Clerval, quietly presses home the irony that he, who once indolently indulged himself in imitating eastern poetry (see I:6:14) now has, in contrast to Victor, a firm sense of personal mission and a commitment to the future. Of course, in Ingolstadt at one point Victor was himself posssessed of both traits.

  It is true that the Creature's first experience of spring was joyful (II:4:19);
  but his memory is here playing tricks with him. He was created on a "dreary
  night of November" (I:4:1),
  and upon his escape into the woods near Ingolstadt he experienced extreme and
  uncomfortable cold. His reaction to his first day of life was, in fact, to
  weep (II:3:2).

    Mary Shelley  at once reminds us that the Creature has feelings and that,
    except on the one occasion on Mont Blanc when he told his life story (II:3:1),
    they are wholly indecipherable to Victor, beset as he is with his calculations
    of revenge. She also prepares us for his unmediated reintroduction into the
    arena of the novel when in its last scene he comes aboard Walton's ship (III:Walton:33).

    The egotism of this statement is less strange than its underlying logic, which is that the closed circle of revenge enacts a kind of perverse sympathy in which the Creature sustains Victor so that he may continue on his mission to destroy his Creature. Throughout this final chapter of Victor's narration Mary Shelley  is ingenious in following through on the implications of a life cast wholly in an ironic mode.

    This encomium to Henry Clerval touches virtually all the thematic stops invoked by the novel in its representation of an ideal character, with terms already enveloped with multiple associations. Although any single one in excess might reveal a flaw productive of personal and social difficulties, in Clerval they reside in a perfect dynamic and dialectical balance. Where earlier critics associate Clerval with Percy Bysshe Shelley, this passage would be taken as a loving tribute to him.

      set up their household in Marlow.
      There Mary Shelley wrote the principal part of this novel. It is clear
      that in retrospect Windsor held a special place in Mary Shelley's memories:
      it is the site, for instance, in which she bases the early chapters of The
      Last Man  (1826),
    with their idealized portraits of herself and Percy Bysshe Shelley. </p>

  At this late point in the novel this vocative is literally true, and the Creature will acknowledge it so three paragraphs later. Still, we have to recognize that we have come full circle: Walton addresses the Creature with the appellation employed by Victor Frankenstein immediately after his creation (I:4:2 and note) and again upon reencountering him on the Mer-de-Glace  of Mont Blanc  (II:2:5 and note). Two sentences later he will reiterate Victor's linguistic leap into transcendental terminology, demonizing the Creature as a fiend. In his response the Creature picks up on the shift in signification, comparing himself both to Adam and to Satan.

    Not since Volume 1 (I:3:13, I:6:18 and note)

    signals a new intensification in the circumstances of the plot, with Henry
