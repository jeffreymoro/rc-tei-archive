               they go in processions, dressed in their holyday clothes, decorated with the strips
               peeled from the rods; they collect contributions, and with them make a feast and a
               dance.

               flowers.<br/> <br/>EDITOR’S NOTE: i.e., <a class="link_ref" href="http://spenserians.cath.vt.edu/TextRecord.php?action=GET&amp;textsid=37652">
                  “Elegy written in a Church-Yard in South Wales”
                  </a> (1787). Morgan’s invocation of the Welsh “<em>Cam</em>brian shepherds” in this stanza shares a homonymic doubling with her Welsh tour and
               her current residence in <em>Cam</em>bridgeshire. The language of Morgan’s footnote mirrors the summary of Mason’s poem
               in the <em>Analytical Review</em>, rather than the poem itself: “The second elegy relates to a local custom among the
               peasants in South Wales, that of planting field flowers and sweet herbs on the graves
               of their relations and friends” (
               “Art. XI,”
               <em>Analytical Review</em> 25 [1797]: 163). The <em>Monthly Review</em> shares similar language in its review, from which Morgan may also have drawn: “one
               written ten years ago in a church-yard in South Wales, on the custom in that country
               of planting sweet herbs and flowers on the grave of a relation” (
               “Art. XIII,”
               <em>Monthly Review</em> ser. 2, 22 [1797]: 439). The Wisbech Literary Society, the subscription library of
               which Morgan’s husband was member, subscribed to the <em>Monthly Review</em>, ostensibly making this publication available to Morgan by extension. The Wisbech
               Literary Society allowed periodicals to circulate among members until their annual
               meeting in July 1798, in which it was decided that new issues of the <em>Monthly Review</em> “be stationary in this Library for a month and then be circulated as usual” (7/26/1798).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
