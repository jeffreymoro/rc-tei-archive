                While the Wisbech Corporation had managed a municipal workhouse since 1720, it 
                admitted neither the ill or infirm, the very young, nor those otherwise incapable 
                of working; had the Osier Family applied for entry, they would likely have 
                separated out the more desirable members. That the twelve-year-old boy is

                developing employable persons that would not further burden the Corporation or 
                the parish. Wisbech was one of the more judicious in matching pauper children with

                  <p>This edition makes available for the first time in 200 years <title level="m">Mary, the 
                    Osier-Peeler, a Simple but True Story: A Poem</title>, printed in
                    1798 by John White in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. Authored anonymously “By a Lady,”
                    this poem is now extant in only one copy currently located in the Marguerite
                    Hicks Collection of Women’s Writings held by Oakland University. The title page
                    indicates that the poetic project is “for the benefit of the Distressed family
                    described in it.” The 18-page quarto pamphlet begins by describing the
                    experiences of a young woman named Mary through the lens of the Fenland
                    agricultural practices and associated customs of rearing osiers, also
                    interchangeably called willows throughout the poem. The poem then catalogues the
                    misfortunes of Mary and her husband William as they navigate bereavement,
                    starvation, eviction, disease, and injury at the turn of the nineteenth
                    century.</p>
                  <p>The inaccessibility of this poem has limited its scholarly notice. What was known
                    has survived as trace entries in bibliographies such as <title level="m">

                    derived from the contemporaneous reviews, which often excerpted a few stanzas of
                    the poem. For its altruism, <title level="m">Mary, the Osier-Peeler</title>
                    largely escaped derision in its critical reception. The <title level="j">Critical 
                        Review</title> foregoes criticizing “a poem published with so
                    benevolent an intention,” and includes an excerpt to “explain the nature of
                    those distresses the purchasers will assist in relieving.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                    “if the poetry be not of the first rate, the tender and benevolent sentiments
                    have the highest claim to praise:—to which, humanity will not fail to yield the
                    preference.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                    <title level="j">Analytical Review</title> wishes the poet
                    had “submitted her manuscript to the revision of some friend” to improve its
                    “unmelodious lines,” it still admits its subject an “affectionate and very
                    unfortunate family.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                                Register</title> (1798): 311.</note> While the reviewers do not 
                    praise the poem for its aesthetic values, they do
                    suspend their duties as arbiters of literary taste to commend its charitable
                    purpose. Within these qualified admissions of merit on moral or charitable
                    grounds, the poem was, then as now, striking enough to warrant notice. For us,
                    the poem contains important clues about its author and her perspective on
                    Fenland life and can help us understand charitable writing amid the tumultuous
                    social changes at the end of the eighteenth century.</p>
                  <p>Bibliographic and geographic points within the poem indicate that the author of
                    the poem is Mary Morgan, née Gibbs (1749–1808), the author of <title level="m">A 
                        Tour to Milford Haven, in 1791</title>, published by John Stockdale in
                    London (1795). Morgan’s <title level="m">Tour</title>, which
                    features the author’s visit to her Welsh-born husband’s home in Pembrokeshire,
                    is an example of well-received epistolary travel writing, receiving favorable
                    reviews in the <title level="j">Monthly Review</title> and
                    <title level="j">British Critic</title>, as well as growing scholarly
                    attention today.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See section “<ref target="#bib">Bibliography of Scholarship on Mary Morgan</ref>.”
                    </note> Scholarship in particular attends to Morgan’s description of the Sandleford
                    estate of “Queen of the Bluestockings,” Elizabeth Montagu. Recent research has
                    also revealed Morgan’s coterie connections with Lady Elizabeth Symonds Gwillim
                    and Frances Boscawen and has illuminated more fully the extent of the

                    Gibbs and wife Mary, at Ipswich, Morgan remains relatively unknown but for what
                    is refracted through the career of her husband, the Rev. Dr. Caesar Morgan
                    (1750–1812). Her husband served at Elm, Coveney, Littleport, Stretham, Little
                    Thetford, and Wisbech—all within a 20-mile radius of the Diocese of Ely in the
                    city of the same—and at the cathedral in which the Morgans would be
                    commemorated, as Rev. Dr. Morgan was Fourth Prebendary of Ely Cathedral at the
                    time of his death.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                    </note> Their time in Wisbech coincides with Mary Morgan’s greatest productivity in
                    published works, including her <title level="m">Tour</title>, <title level="m">Mary, the Osier-Peeler</title>, and a third publication, <title level="m">The
                        Knyghte of the Golden Locks: An Ancyent Poem, Applicable to the Present
                        Times</title> (1799), purportedly “selected from many others in the possession of Mrs.
                    Morgan.”</p>
                  <p>The known literary output of Morgan can open <title level="m">Mary, the
                        Osier-Peeler</title> to fruitful new directions of inquiry. As in her Welsh
                    travel narrative, Morgan establishes herself at the outset of the osier poem as
                    a tour guide, explaining to readers in the preface the significance of osiers,
                    as “it may be requisite to explain to those, who are not acquainted with the
                    produce of <emph>Cambridgeshire</emph> that . . .
                    the delicate Willow Hats, of late so fashionable, are made of Cambridgeshire
                    Osiers.” Born in Ipswich, Morgan was herself nonnative to Cambridgeshire, and
                    positions herself as intermediary between the titular “distressed family” and
                    their would-be patrons, providing paratextual explanations where she foresees a
                    lapse in the patrons’ cultural or literary understanding. As with Morgan’s
                    epistolary descriptions of the people, roads, hotels, and customs en route to
                    Wales, the preface of <title level="m">Mary, the Osier-Peeler</title> succinctly
                    summarizes the customs of willow-growing communities. Unless one had already
                    read the critical reviews of the poem, there is little indication from the
                    cheery tone of the preface and its talk of fashionable hats, celebratory dances,
                    and feasts that Morgan’s poem entails more than entrée to Cambridgeshire country
                    life. Within the first few stanzas, Morgan’s invocation of John Milton’s
                     <title level="a">Lycidas</title> and the elegies of Thomas Gray and William Mason places her poem as
                    extension and critique of the pastoral and elegiac traditions along the banks of
                    the River Cam, focusing instead on those people “Who by all are unknown and
                    unseen, / Except the broad eye of their God” (39–40). While Morgan deploys the
                    topoi of <foreign xml:lang="fr">au courant</foreign> Romanticism, her incisive critique of
                    the seismic cultural, political, and social changes concentrated in the last
                    decade of the eighteenth century is coupled with relief for her poetic objects,
                    as she sponsors the injured son of the Osier Family, however microcosmic her own
                    contribution may be.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See lines 289–320 and corresponding

                  <p>Morgan would have been privy to the parish-supported poor in Wisbech where the
                    poem was printed, as her husband served as vicar to the parishes of Wisbech St.
                    Mary and Wisbech St. Peter from late 1795 to early 1802. These war years were
                    particularly difficult for Cambridgeshire: apart from serially poor harvests,
                    unemployment, inflation, food riots, and fear of unrest among laborers
                    sympathetic to the French cause, the further draining of the fens for
                    agricultural purposes compounded the impoverishment of the unlanded poor, who
                    had for centuries made their living per the right of common and waste for
                    gathering firewood, raising poultry, and hunting game, and who had assumed the
                    custom of gleaning grain after harvest. The fencing-off of common ground into
                    neat parcels of arable farmland spatially marginalized the poor, which is where
                    Morgan’s poem meets them: on the banks of waterways, not lamenting the loss of
                    college-educated men, but cultivating and tending to osiers, a high-moisture
                    crop grown on the physical and social fringe of arable land and the connotation
                    of social exclusion it was assuming.</p>
                  <p>The marshy Fenlands upon which Wisbech is located created a particularly
                    difficult set of stereotypes for Morgan to overcome and generate pity among her
                    readers. English literature, from <title level="m">Beowulf</title> to
                    <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title> to <title level="m">The Pilgrim’s Progress</title>, 
                    tends to attribute evil, fear, temptation, and
                    literal and spiritual danger to the swamp.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For a

                    seventeenth into the late eighteenth century had
                    increased arable land, the Wisbech and surrounding communities retained enough
                    marshland for contemporary comment; a local doctor remarked in 1801 that “the
                    stench of the exhalations issuing from the corrupted, stagnant water, and
                    putrid, half dried mud or ooze, was most intolerably offensive . . . the
                    effluvia was almost suffocating.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Robert

                    health hazard of the marshes was not without grounds. The standing waters of the
                    fens were breeding grounds for mosquitos capable of transmitting “fen ague,”
                    which medical historians today believe was a form of malaria, albeit a less
                    virulent illness than that caused by the deadly <foreign xml:lang="la">Plasmodium

                        rates, arguing that poor sanitation and hygiene are also to blame. See Robert A.

                  </p>
                  <p>The threat of fen ague was coupled with tropes of fen dwellers’ moral depravity
                    and perceived racial otherness, which were cited as rationale for their further
                    disenfranchisement. As one commenter from nearby Lincolnshire wrote in 1799, “So
                    wild a country nurses up a race of people as wild as the fen; and thus the
                    morals and eternal welfare of numbers are hazarded or ruined for want of an
                    inclosure.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Arthur Young, <title level="m">General

                                    Improvement</title> (London: G. Nicol, 1799), 223–24.</note> The fen 
                    people were seen as a race apart from village dwellers by virtue of
                    their breathing in the “denser air” of greater miasmatic contaminants. Local
                    lore even held that fen people had webbed feet, divesting them of humanity
                    altogether. Apart from her textual subjects’ social class, then, Morgan’s poetic
                    representation of the fen-dwelling Osier Family must reckon with the social and
                    geographic determinants of health that contributed to the racialized stereotypes
                    of fen people and their adaptive customs.</p>
                  <p>Morgan’s choice of osier propagation as poetic image is fitting for its
                    geographic and sociocultural registers. Osiers were valued for their
                    flexibility, durability, and quick yield. Apart from the stylish hats with which
                    Morgan hooks her fashionable would-be readers, peeled osiers are famed as the
                    stuff of basketmaking, and were also used as fence wood, fuel, traps for
                    catching freshwater eels, and timber for furniture, and were grown in
                    proprietary holts tended by seasonal hired labor or propagated informally for
                    crude housewares. The Osier Family itself lives in a “willow-built cot” (36),
                    and when evicted, Morgan notes they are bereft also “of their chairs, they of
                    osiers had twin’d” (198). Osiers are planted as 10-inch cuttings, pushed firmly
                    into the ground to leave only a couple inches visible above ground. In the first
                    year, the rods that grow through the spring and summer are cut immediately after
                    the leaves have fallen. In the second season, the original cutting is now called
                    a stool, and can produce up to 100 rods attaining lengths of up to 11 feet
                    during one growing season. The long rods are cut, collected, and tied into
                    bundles that are just under four feet in girth. The bundles are then pitted, or
                    left standing in a few inches of water until the sap rises, usually in late
                    February. It is at this point, after a few months left in standing water, that
                    the rods are ready to be peeled of their bark. Morgan’s poem takes up here, and
                    the titular Mary as “osier-peeler” comes into play.</p>
                  <p>The process of peeling itself was commonly performed by women, children, the
                    infirm, and the elderly. Workers would sit or kneel on the ground and pass each
                    rod through the teeth of an iron instrument called a break, fastened into the
                    ground, to strip away the bark. The window of time for peeling is quite narrow,
                    being at its longest two weeks, or, likely, the “Twelve Suns” that Morgan counts
                    before the overseer comes to count the bundles and compensate the laborers
                    (99–102). While the process of peeling was simple enough, feeding thousands of
                    the rods’ “tough rind” into the break would have certainly inscribed itself on
                    the hands of its laborers; as Morgan writes, “from its wounds, [Mary] well knew,
                    / Her fingers no care could defend” (79–80). </p>
                  <p>Because fen people were often typecast as “lazy” and less deserving of charitable
                    aid, Morgan takes care to emphasize the composite nature of the income of Mary,
                    and in subsequent lines, Mary and William’s large family. Mary pleads leave of
                    her mother to “go with the maids of the town” to peel the osiers and “earn . . .
                    what [she] can’t at [her] wheel” (68–71). Morgan here twins spinning and
                    osier-peeling to show how Mary cobbles together piecemeal labors in a shift
                    economy: her hands now “stript the tall rod, / As erst ran the wheel thro’ her
                    hand” (88). Rather than the imaginative weaving of laurels for the poet, Morgan
                    shifts the aesthetic focus—and by extension, the <emph>work</emph> of
                    the poem—to the practical labors of the fen dwellers’ spinning, peeling, and
                    weaving. The work of cultivating osiers demands intense labor per acre,
                    requiring workers to plant sets, deter insect infestation, cut rods and grade
                    them according to size, bundle the rods, and peel them. The bulk of this labor
                    took place in the off-season of other agricultural practice, and many laborers
                    would have combined this work with cottage industry for survival. Morgan’s
                    careful subversion of poetic labor as merely “resting on one’s laurels”
                    emphasizes the industriousness of fen people and the Osier Family in particular,
                    imbuing them with moral goodness worth reward.</p>
                  <p>Although Mary and her family demonstrate a willing and cheerful industriousness,
                    they are nonetheless subject to bereavement, starvation, eviction, disease, and
                    injury during this period of fluctuation and instability regarding care for the
                    poor. Reading <title level="m">Mary, the Osier-Peeler</title> can teach us how to
                    bring the sociohistorical to bear on the literary and contribute to discussions
                    at the intersections of provincial women’s writing, place-based writing,
                    ecocriticism, and Romantic women’s charity publications, as well as edifying our
                    understanding of Mary Morgan as more than a travel writer.</p>

                    900 books, pamphlets, and broadsides by and about British women from the
                    seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, held at Oakland University’s
                    Kresge Library in Rochester, Michigan. Marguerite Hicks, a blind, widowed, queer
                    Detroiter, amassed the collection in the late 1930s and early 40s together with
                    her partner, Thelma James. The Marguerite Hicks Collection is likely the first
                    intentional collection of works by and about women from the seventeenth and
                    eighteenth centuries to be gathered by an American collector. It contains ballad
                    broadsides, novels, cookbooks, political tracts, educational texts, sermons,
                    plays, poetry, and more. Dozens of the items in this collection exist in fewer
                    than ten known copies worldwide, and a handful are uniquely existing copies.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This electronic edition makes the text available for the first time in over 
                    200 years from the single known copy in the world. As an electronic edition 
                    in <title level="j">Romantic Circles</title>, the poem is machine-readable, 
                    enabling access not only to those without physical access, but 
                    also to those with sight disabilities in the spirit of its twentieth-century collector, 
                    Marguerite Hicks.</p>
               <p rend="noCount">I have replaced the long <emph>s</emph> with its more familiar counterpart 
                    but have retained Morgan’s idiosyncratic orthography.</p>
               <p rend="noCount">To differentiate between Morgan’s original footnotes and those I have added 
                    for context or clarity, I have prefaced each with Author’s note or Editor’s note, as appropriate.</p>

                    Marguerite Hicks Project, which seeks to develop the provenance of the Marguerite Hicks Collection
