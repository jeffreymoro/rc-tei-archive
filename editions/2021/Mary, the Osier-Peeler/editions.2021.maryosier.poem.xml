                            Morgan’s invocation of the Welsh “<emph>Cam</emph>brian
                            shepherds” in this stanza shares a homonymic doubling with her Welsh
                            tour and her current residence in <emph>Cam</emph>bridgeshire.
                            The language of Morgan’s footnote mirrors the summary of Mason’s poem in
                            the <title level="j">Analytical Review</title>, rather than the poem
                            itself: “The second elegy relates to a local custom among the peasants
                            in South Wales, that of planting field flowers and sweet herbs on the
                            graves of their relations and friends” (<title level="a">Art. XI,</title> <title

                            which Morgan may also have drawn: “one written ten years ago in a
                            church-yard in South Wales, on the custom in that country of planting
                            sweet herbs and flowers on the grave of a relation” (<title level="a">Art. XIII,</title> <title 
                                level="j">Monthly Review</title> ser. 2, 22 [1797]: 439). The
                            Wisbech Literary Society, the subscription library of which Morgan’s

                While the Wisbech Corporation had managed a municipal workhouse since 1720, it 
                admitted neither the ill or infirm, the very young, nor those otherwise incapable 
                of working; had the Osier Family applied for entry, they would likely have 
                separated out the more desirable members. That the twelve-year-old boy is 
                apprenticed out to learn a particular skill or craft was a common means of 
                developing employable persons that would not further burden the Corporation or 
                the parish. Wisbech was one of the more judicious in matching pauper children with 
                savory masters, as demonstrated in their 1787 advertisement in the <title level="j">Cambridge
