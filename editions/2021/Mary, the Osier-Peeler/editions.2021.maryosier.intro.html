               <p>This edition makes available for the first time in 200 years <em>Mary, the Osier-Peeler, a Simple but True Story: A Poem</em>, printed in 1798 by John White in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. Authored anonymously “By
                  a Lady,” this poem is now extant in only one copy currently located in the Marguerite
                  Hicks Collection of Women’s Writings held by Oakland University. The title page indicates
                  that the poetic project is “for the benefit of the Distressed family described in
                  it.” The 18-page quarto pamphlet begins by describing the experiences of a young woman
                  named Mary through the lens of the Fenland agricultural practices and associated customs
                  of rearing osiers, also interchangeably called willows throughout the poem. The poem
                  then catalogues the misfortunes of Mary and her husband William as they navigate bereavement,
                  starvation, eviction, disease, and injury at the turn of the nineteenth century.

                  <p>The inaccessibility of this poem has limited its scholarly notice. What was known
                     has survived as trace entries in bibliographies such as <em><a class="link_ref" href="https://womensprinthistoryproject.com/title/11651">The Women’s Print History Project</a></em> and <em><a class="link_ref" href="https://jacksonbibliography.library.utoronto.ca/search/details/12708">Jackson Bibliography of Romantic Poetry</a></em>, derived from the contemporaneous reviews, which often excerpted a few stanzas of
                     the poem. For its altruism, <em>Mary, the Osier-Peeler</em> largely escaped derision in its critical reception. The <em>Critical Review</em> foregoes criticizing “a poem published with so benevolent an intention,” and includes
                     an excerpt to “explain the nature of those distresses the purchasers will assist in
                     relieving.”

                     the preference.”

                     their duties as arbiters of literary taste to commend its charitable purpose. Within
                     these qualified admissions of merit on moral or charitable grounds, the poem was,
                     then as now, striking enough to warrant notice. For us, the poem contains important
                     clues about its author and her perspective on Fenland life and can help us understand
                     charitable writing amid the tumultuous social changes at the end of the eighteenth
                     century.

                     is an example of well-received epistolary travel writing, receiving favorable reviews

                     the Diocese of Ely in the city of the same—and at the cathedral in which the Morgans

                     works, including her <em>Tour</em>, <em>Mary, the Osier-Peeler</em>, and a third publication, <em>The Knyghte of the Golden Locks: An Ancyent Poem, Applicable to the Present Times</em> (1799), purportedly “selected from many others in the possession of Mrs. Morgan.”

                  <p>The known literary output of Morgan can open <em>Mary, the Osier-Peeler</em> to fruitful new directions of inquiry. As in her Welsh travel narrative, Morgan establishes
                     herself at the outset of the osier poem as a tour guide, explaining to readers in
                     the preface the significance of osiers, as “it may be requisite to explain to those,
                     who are not acquainted with the produce of <em>Cambridgeshire</em> that . . . the delicate Willow Hats, of late so fashionable, are made of Cambridgeshire
                     Osiers.” Born in Ipswich, Morgan was herself nonnative to Cambridgeshire, and positions
                     herself as intermediary between the titular “distressed family” and their would-be
                     patrons, providing paratextual explanations where she foresees a lapse in the patrons’
                     cultural or literary understanding. As with Morgan’s epistolary descriptions of the
                     people, roads, hotels, and customs en route to Wales, the preface of <em>Mary, the Osier-Peeler</em> succinctly summarizes the customs of willow-growing communities. Unless one had already
                     read the critical reviews of the poem, there is little indication from the cheery
                     tone of the preface and its talk of fashionable hats, celebratory dances, and feasts
                     that Morgan’s poem entails more than entrée to Cambridgeshire country life. Within
                     the first few stanzas, Morgan’s invocation of John Milton’s 
                     “Lycidas”
                      and the elegies of Thomas Gray and William Mason places her poem as extension and
                     critique of the pastoral and elegiac traditions along the banks of the River Cam,
                     focusing instead on those people “Who by all are unknown and unseen, / Except the
                     broad eye of their God” (39–40). While Morgan deploys the topoi of <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">au courant</span> Romanticism, her incisive critique of the seismic cultural, political, and social
                     changes concentrated in the last decade of the eighteenth century is coupled with
                     relief for her poetic objects, as she sponsors the injured son of the Osier Family,
                     however microcosmic her own contribution may be.

               <p>Morgan would have been privy to the parish-supported poor in Wisbech where the poem
                  was printed, as her husband served as vicar to the parishes of Wisbech St. Mary and
                  Wisbech St. Peter from late 1795 to early 1802. These war years were particularly
                  difficult for Cambridgeshire: apart from serially poor harvests, unemployment, inflation,
                  food riots, and fear of unrest among laborers sympathetic to the French cause, the
                  further draining of the fens for agricultural purposes compounded the impoverishment
                  of the unlanded poor, who had for centuries made their living per the right of common
                  and waste for gathering firewood, raising poultry, and hunting game, and who had assumed
                  the custom of gleaning grain after harvest. The fencing-off of common ground into
                  neat parcels of arable farmland spatially marginalized the poor, which is where Morgan’s
                  poem meets them: on the banks of waterways, not lamenting the loss of college-educated
                  men, but cultivating and tending to osiers, a high-moisture crop grown on the physical
                  and social fringe of arable land and the connotation of social exclusion it was assuming.

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The marshy Fenlands upon which Wisbech is located created a particularly difficult
                     set of stereotypes for Morgan to overcome and generate pity among her readers. English
                     literature, from <em>Beowulf</em> to <em>Paradise Lost</em> to <em>The Pilgrim’s Progress</em>, tends to attribute evil, fear, temptation, and literal and spiritual danger to the
                     swamp.

                     contemporary comment; a local doctor remarked in 1801 that “the stench of the exhalations

                     up a race of people as wild as the fen; and thus the morals and eternal welfare of

                              Nicol, 1799), 223–24.</span></div>
                     </div> The fen people were seen as a race apart from village dwellers by virtue of their
                     breathing in the “denser air” of greater miasmatic contaminants. Local lore even held
                     that fen people had webbed feet, divesting them of humanity altogether. Apart from
                     her textual subjects’ social class, then, Morgan’s poetic representation of the fen-dwelling
                     Osier Family must reckon with the social and geographic determinants of health that
                     contributed to the racialized stereotypes of fen people and their adaptive customs.
                  </p>
               </div>
               <p>Morgan’s choice of osier propagation as poetic image is fitting for its geographic
                  and sociocultural registers. Osiers were valued for their flexibility, durability,
                  and quick yield. Apart from the stylish hats with which Morgan hooks her fashionable
                  would-be readers, peeled osiers are famed as the stuff of basketmaking, and were also
                  used as fence wood, fuel, traps for catching freshwater eels, and timber for furniture,
                  and were grown in proprietary holts tended by seasonal hired labor or propagated informally
                  for crude housewares. The Osier Family itself lives in a “willow-built cot” (36),
                  and when evicted, Morgan notes they are bereft also “of their chairs, they of osiers
                  had twin’d” (198). Osiers are planted as 10-inch cuttings, pushed firmly into the
                  ground to leave only a couple inches visible above ground. In the first year, the
                  rods that grow through the spring and summer are cut immediately after the leaves
                  have fallen. In the second season, the original cutting is now called a stool, and
                  can produce up to 100 rods attaining lengths of up to 11 feet during one growing season.
                  The long rods are cut, collected, and tied into bundles that are just under four feet
                  in girth. The bundles are then pitted, or left standing in a few inches of water until
                  the sap rises, usually in late February. It is at this point, after a few months left
                  in standing water, that the rods are ready to be peeled of their bark. Morgan’s poem
                  takes up here, and the titular Mary as “osier-peeler” comes into play.
               </p>
               <p>The process of peeling itself was commonly performed by women, children, the infirm,
                  and the elderly. Workers would sit or kneel on the ground and pass each rod through
                  the teeth of an iron instrument called a break, fastened into the ground, to strip
                  away the bark. The window of time for peeling is quite narrow, being at its longest
                  two weeks, or, likely, the “Twelve Suns” that Morgan counts before the overseer comes
                  to count the bundles and compensate the laborers (99–102). While the process of peeling
                  was simple enough, feeding thousands of the rods’ “tough rind” into the break would
                  have certainly inscribed itself on the hands of its laborers; as Morgan writes, “from
                  its wounds, [Mary] well knew, / Her fingers no care could defend” (79–80). 
               </p>
               <p>Because fen people were often typecast as “lazy” and less deserving of charitable
                  aid, Morgan takes care to emphasize the composite nature of the income of Mary, and
                  in subsequent lines, Mary and William’s large family. Mary pleads leave of her mother
                  to “go with the maids of the town” to peel the osiers and “earn . . . what [she] can’t
                  at [her] wheel” (68–71). Morgan here twins spinning and osier-peeling to show how
                  Mary cobbles together piecemeal labors in a shift economy: her hands now “stript the
                  tall rod, / As erst ran the wheel thro’ her hand” (88). Rather than the imaginative
                  weaving of laurels for the poet, Morgan shifts the aesthetic focus—and by extension,
                  the <em>work</em> of the poem—to the practical labors of the fen dwellers’ spinning, peeling, and weaving.
                  The work of cultivating osiers demands intense labor per acre, requiring workers to
                  plant sets, deter insect infestation, cut rods and grade them according to size, bundle
                  the rods, and peel them. The bulk of this labor took place in the off-season of other
                  agricultural practice, and many laborers would have combined this work with cottage
                  industry for survival. Morgan’s careful subversion of poetic labor as merely “resting
                  on one’s laurels” emphasizes the industriousness of fen people and the Osier Family
                  in particular, imbuing them with moral goodness worth reward.
               </p>
               <p>Although Mary and her family demonstrate a willing and cheerful industriousness, they
                  are nonetheless subject to bereavement, starvation, eviction, disease, and injury
                  during this period of fluctuation and instability regarding care for the poor. Reading
                  <em>Mary, the Osier-Peeler</em> can teach us how to bring the sociohistorical to bear on the literary and contribute
                  to discussions at the intersections of provincial women’s writing, place-based writing,
                  ecocriticism, and Romantic women’s charity publications, as well as edifying our understanding
                  of Mary Morgan as more than a travel writer.

               <p>This 18-page pamphlet is held in the <a class="link_ref" href="https://library.oakland.edu/collections/special/hicks.html">Marguerite Hicks Collection of Women’s Writings</a>, which contains over 900 books, pamphlets, and broadsides by and about British women
                  from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, held at Oakland University’s
                  Kresge Library in Rochester, Michigan. Marguerite Hicks, a blind, widowed, queer Detroiter,
                  amassed the collection in the late 1930s and early 40s together with her partner,
                  Thelma James. The Marguerite Hicks Collection is likely the first intentional collection
                  of works by and about women from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to be gathered
                  by an American collector. It contains ballad broadsides, novels, cookbooks, political
                  tracts, educational texts, sermons, plays, poetry, and more. Dozens of the items in
                  this collection exist in fewer than ten known copies worldwide, and a handful are
                  uniquely existing copies.
