               <p>In answer to the very kind &amp; affectionate enquiries of M<sup>rs</sup> R. &amp; yourself concerning the unfortunate situation of M<sup>r</sup> Barbauld I must give you a short history of his case, the peculiarities of which you,
                  who have known him so long, will be well able to enter into. I cannot say that this
                  event has been altogether unexpected, for, besides the natural extreme irritability
                  of his temper &amp; a family disposition to great irregularity of spirits,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)

                           “Rochemont Barbauld's Disorder.”
                           </span></div>
                  </div> nearly the same train of symptoms of mental derangement occurred several months ago,
                  which though they did not proceed to any act of outrage were amply sufficient to give
                  a foreboding of a future &amp; more violent attack. He did however compleatly recover
                  from the former unfortunate state of mental irritation after having suffered an equal
                  depression of spirits, but I am grieved to say that at present the hopes of a permanent
                  recovery appear very far distant.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p class="noCount">The present attack may be traced in its beginning to an unusual eagerness for argument
               &amp; debate of all kinds, an extremely disputatious spirit &amp; unbounded fluency of words
               which had been occasionally remarked by several of his friends, &amp; in mixed company
               only enlivened the conversation. Still however it was observed that only one or two
               favourite topics particularly of a religious nature could interest him &amp; these he
               was constantly recurring to. Added to this there came on such an excessive increase
               of all his restless personal habits that the day was scarcely sufficient for his numerous
               little operations about his person. It would have been very fortunate for his friends
               &amp; M<sup>rs</sup> B. in particular if this state of mind had gone no further, but the spirit of disputation
               which in company only led to long arguments on religious topics, in private with M<sup>rs</sup> B. took the distressing
            </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>[<em>fol 1<sup>v</sup></em>] turn of incessant unkind harassing on the merest domestic trifles, during which
                  he was in the habit of insisting in the most peremptory manner on inexhaustible patience
                  in her to listen for hours together to his fancied complaints &amp; even went so far as
                  frequently to use the most insulting &amp; unhandsome language &amp; to lock the door to prevent
                  her from escaping from his violence. The distress &amp; anxiety which such treatment produced
                  on her feeling heart you will readily conceive, &amp; I as well [as] many other of her
                  friends can bear witness to the extreme forbearance which she shewed, being aware
                  of the unsettled state of his mind &amp; the frequent threats of suicide with which his
                  fits of fury were accompanied whenever she made any attempts to escape from them.
                  This kind of usage however was proceeding so far &amp; so totally destroying all her comfort
                  &amp; occupying all her time, that her friends had actually resolved to make a strong
                  remonstrance to him, when <span class="overstrike">the</span> a most violent paroxysm came on during which after a storm of the most furious &amp; shocking
                  language he was induced to threaten both her life &amp; his own, &amp; on her escaping from
                  him he actually put in execution the threat against himself by taking a large quantity
                  of laudanum in presence of his servants who of course spread the alarm over the village
                  &amp; made the circumstance quite public. He was perswaded however to take the proper
                  means to prevent the effect of his rashness, &amp; a day or two after, as I found that
                  the whole of his mental disease took the turn of ^settled^ anger against her, I invited
                  him to Broad St

                  </div> where he stayed a week. During the time he was with us, his opinion of fancied ill
                  usage on the part of M<sup>rs</sup> B. remained unalterable, though he expressed the highest esteem &amp; even love for her
                  &amp; was readily brought to an acknowledgement of the impropriety of his conduct. Under
                  these circumstances we thought that he might be trusted to return to Newington under
                  a most solemn promise of refraining from all violence towards her &amp; of allowing her
                  a separate bed &amp; sitting room to which she might retire at all times, &amp; though he
                  still fully insisted on an ample discussion of his supposed grievances &amp; fully expected
                  great concessions on her

               these preposterous ideas would subside &amp; his mind resume its usual serenity. This
               we ^the^ more repeated, as he was at all times ready to allow even with utmost vehemence
               of expression the great degree to which he had been indebted to her kindness her excellent
               conduct during life, &amp; as the sum total of his grievances was only her refusing to
               persevere in discussing with him, <span class="overstrike">his</span> which for reasons which I have already mentioned she most prudently declined. I should
               add that he has at all times expressed a perfect acquiescence in the proposal of separation
               &amp; on the most liberal pecuniary terms, but he has at the same time accompanied this
               with <span class="overstrike">such</span> strong expressions of distress amounting to despair at being obliged to resort to
               this alternative, &amp; with very unequivocal hints at suicide if compelled to it.

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>But he had no sooner returned to Newington than he resumed the subjects of altercation
                  which were always uppermost in his mind, &amp; one morning in direct violation of his
                  promise he again resorted to the same violence of language, to locking her up with
                  him &amp; to the threats of suicide, &amp; in the course of the morning his frenzy became
                  so violent that my father

                  </div> was at last, after waiting to the utmost, compelled to put him under confinement in
                  his own house. He is now sufficiently tranquil, though immoveable as to the particular
                  points of his insanity, highly indignant at his confinement &amp; the supposed conspiracy
                  against him, &amp; to any common friend he talks with so much plausibility &amp; coolness
                  as would impose on any one unacquainted with the previous circumstances. He is fully
                  buoyed up with the hope of perswading all the world to be on his side &amp; I believe
                  partly for that reason he has such a guard on his conduct that no personal restraint
                  has been necessary, so that his confinement is as gentle as possible. My father has
                  taken the opinions of M<sup>r</sup> Haslam &amp; D<sup>r</sup> Simmons both men of high eminence in such unfortunate cases,
