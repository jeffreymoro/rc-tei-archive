                  your mind receives the impressions those facts are calculated to make— Nothing exercises
                  the moral feelings more profitably than History. Whe[n] we study those parts of science
                  which relate to inanimate nature, our sagacity is called forth &amp; our taste is gratified,
                  but that lively interest is wanting which results from contemplating the actions &amp;
                  fortunes of our fellow creatures. On the other hand when we enter with vivacity into
                  the transactions which pass before our eyes, our feelings are apt to be mingled with
                  the bitterness of party or tinged with private partialities &amp; resentments. In History
                  alone nothing checks the freedom of discussion [<em>written over</em> “dissension”<em>?</em>] you may take the side of the Greeks or of the Persians, <br/><span class="catchword">without</span></p>
