                  pleasure indeed it will be to renew the intercourse which once was so frequent with
                  you &amp; to improve the acquaintance with M<sup>r</sup> Withering which was commenced by the glimpse you were so good as to give me of him
                  soon after your marriage. London is particularly full at present. I do not often venture
                  into its crowded streets, the bustle of which is now particularly disagreeable to
                  me, but I was drawn there the other day by a strong inducement, the meeting Miss Edgeworth,
                  who with her father &amp; his fourth wife a handsome &amp; very agreeable woman are now in
                  London.

               makes it very likely that she meant the letters on History she had sent to LR in or
               soon after 1800. LR has returned them; slightly altered texts were printed by LA in
               <em>A Legacy for Young Ladies</em> (1826). ALB's next sentences allude to her 
               “Dialogue in the Shades,”
               written probably earlier in the year after reading about the Retreat from Moscow,
               a commentary on the abundance and magnitude of current events which make irrelevant
               the ancient mythology still taught in schools. It can be inferred that ALB intended
               to revise the letters on History for publication, and that the revised texts were
               the ones printed by LA.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
