               <p>I learn from the very obliging attention of a piece of wedding cake, which has been

                  &amp; earnest prayers, that all the happiness this uncertain state can afford may be their
                  lot; unabated affection, health, prosperous circumstances &amp; a promising offspring,
                  &amp; may you long enjoy the sight of all these blessings. I do not know what your own
                  plans are, but I hope you will not long be separated from one another—Do let me hear
                  from you soon . As to my own prospects they are very dark at present. The absence
                  of three months (a long one I thought it) has not had the effect which <br/> <span class="catchword">was</span></p>

                  possession of his mind, &amp; I fear I must at length be obliged to submit to the heart-breaking
                  expedient of a separation. The state of irritation he is in when with me, evidently
                  does him hurt, &amp; if he is, which is certainly the case, much better at a distance
                  from me, I must not any further attempt to keep ^him^. You will, my dear friend, enter
                  into my feelings sufficiently without my dwelling upon them—On running over these
                  sentences I find I have said <span style="text-decoration:underline">he</span> &amp; <span style="text-decoration:underline">him</span> without mentioning M<sup>r</sup> Barbauld, but that is ^all one,^ it can require no explanation—Since I began this
                  letter, some days have passed, &amp; I am now for a week at Westham with M<sup>rs</sup> Gregory whom you know, at least by character.

                  determined. My brother &amp; Charles both say I must <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> return to my own house, while M<sup>r</sup> Barbauld is there—What plan I shall follow, where I shall be &amp; where he will be I
                  know not yet. I shall endeavour to keep up my spirits as well as I can, &amp; must seek
                  for something of employment &amp; something of company, but I can form no scheme yet—I
