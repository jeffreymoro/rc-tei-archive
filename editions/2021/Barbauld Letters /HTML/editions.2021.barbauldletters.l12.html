                  feelings which habitual intercourse esteem &amp; friendship has so long connected with
                  both your names. I am sorry to hear M<sup>rs</sup> Rickards &amp; you have been so much indisposed, but you have had but neighbours’ fare

                  as forty Germans when they scold” She says this is not only the case with the lower
                  orders, but with people of the first fashion at their conversaziones, who talk in
                  the loudest key.——We have been reading with much interest Hayley’s life of Cowper,
                  or rather Cowper’s letters for the 2 Vols consist of letters connected by a very slender
                  thread of Biography. It is wonderful how Cowpers mind seemed to flow out in affection
                  &amp; embrace new attachments, even when his dreadful malady had hold of him.
