            <p class="noCount">I should not have been thus long in offering you my congratulations on the late interesting
               event, but I knew that after the example of all the couples just paired you had taken
               a flight, &amp; till I saw M<sup>rs</sup> Rickards I had not your address. I took it very kindly indeed of M<sup>rs</sup> Rickards that she bestowed a morning upon me during the short time she spent in London.
               It was to me an interesting interview. The opportunity of hearing with some detail
               what I had only heard in general, &amp; of mingling my own wishes &amp; feelings with the
               wishes &amp; feelings of one so interested in your welfare as a parent was very grateful
               to me, &amp; many a fervent wish did we pour out for your happiness which we humbly trust
               the dispenser of all happiness will sanction &amp; fulfill— Alas my dear Friend it is
               only in carrying my thoughts out of myself &amp; my own situation that I can now enjoy
               any happiness—M<sup>rs</sup> Rickards has no doubt told you that<br/> <span class="catchword">an</span></p>

                  believe it) the person I have loved &amp; still do love more than any other in the world,
                  &amp; whose tender affection to me you have so often been witness to—I have been this
                  week here at Parndon,

                  </div> when I return I shall in a few days be left alone, a solitary being, in a large house
                  where every thing will put me in mind of my lost companion—I hope in some way or other
                  to engage a companion that will prevent the utter solitude which I am sure I cannot
                  bear, but the companion of more than thirty years will he ever return? Alas at present,
                  I see little prospect of it—This is not like a congratulatory wedding letter, I am
                  sorry for it, but I cannot help it——You will naturally ask where does M<sup>r</sup> Barbauld go. He will take for the present lodgings in London near Charles, &amp; board
                  with him, &amp; I hope will spend his time pleasantly, for he is generally in good spirits
                  &amp; you never saw him more lively or entertaining— I think you know a little the family
                  I am now with; the young ladies are all grown up but one, &amp; exhibit a pleasing variety
                  of tempers &amp; countenances all, in different degrees, agreeable. M<sup>rs</sup> Smith
