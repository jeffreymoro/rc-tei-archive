               <p>You &amp; M<sup>rs</sup> Rickards, I know well, have too truly sympathized with me in my heavy affliction,
                  to wonder at my not having addressed you by letter for some time past. Yet to such
                  friends I should have written, but that I knew Charles had given you an account of
                  our then situation, &amp; I have now waited in hopes to give you a better account than
                  you had at that time—And I <span style="text-decoration:underline">have</span> the satisfaction to tell you that my dear M<sup>r</sup> Barbauld is materially better, nay I may say well in every particular but one—If you

                  </div> I apprehend he will tell you that he dined with him, &amp; that he did not exhibit any
                  thing in his behaviour different from a perfectly sane man.—He has been now for some
                  weeks free from attendance or restraint, except the influence which Charles as a medical
                  man assumes over him. He has been to see Cooke in<br/> <span class="catchword">the</span></p>

                  his friends—He is not at all low, neither at present is there any violence in his
                  manner—Yet in one circumstance, most distressing to me, he is not materially altered.
                  His alienation from me still continues, &amp; has the appearance of being strongly fixed—
                  Oh my dear Lydia could you have thought when you last saw us that I should ever have
                  to lament the decay of affection in him who loved me so well—I do not feel less affection
                  for him, for I know malady is alone the cause; but I feel wounded in the tenderest
                  part, a part for which I had provided no armour, &amp; what grieves me the most is that
                  I can be of no service to him. In any other calamity I could have soothed, attended
                  nurst him, in this, absence from him can alone have a chance of being serviceable.
                  In a temporary absence however I have great hopes; he is to go to Norwich to spend
                  two or three months ^in lodgings there^ &amp; he will be there surrounded with kind friends.
                  God grant a complete restoration——I know you love us so well that I make no apology
                  my dear Lydia, for thus clouding your opening <br/> <span class="catchword">prospects</span></p>

                  the question now——I assure you I do all I can to keep up my spirits—my friends here
                  are very kind to me, &amp; hope &amp; employment of some sort or other enable me to get tolerably
                  through the day; but there is a lonely &amp; desolate feel in the evening which sometimes
