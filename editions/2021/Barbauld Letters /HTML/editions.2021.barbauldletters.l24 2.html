               <p>Thanks for your kind letter which I should have answered sooner, but really the very
                  hot weather we have had gave me such a feeling of debility that everything like exertion
                  was a burden to me. With hot weather we are not likely to be troubled again this season,
                  but I feel I am fast approaching the season when, as Solomon tells us, every thing,
                  even the grasshopper is a burden. I hope however I shall feel it last in those exertions
                  necessary to maintain the friendly intercourses of life which give life itself its
                  value— I recieved Blair
