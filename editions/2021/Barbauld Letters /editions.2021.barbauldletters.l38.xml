                    &amp; I was going to write to settle the account, as one settles all one’s
                    accounts at Christmas ^you know^&#8212; As one ought always to begin with
                    matters of business, let me tell you that I asked my Brother, as you desired me,
                    for letters, &amp; I am sorry to tell you that he has not one. He never, he
                    says, was in regular correspondence with D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Withering,<note

                    will <del rend="overstrike">do</del> ^pursue^ it. Who should travel if not such

                    comforts Englishmen expect, &amp; the inns will have provided accordingly. I
                    have been travelling too. I have been ascending Chimborazo with Humbolt,<note

                        the highest mountain known to Europeans. It was ascended by Alexander von
                        Humboldt (1769–1859), whose book about his travels in South America was
                        translated by Helen Maria Williams as <title level="m">Researches,

                    credit to Helen Williams to have translated such a book. The greater part of it
                    is far too scientific for me, but these scenes of wild nature Humbolt makes me
                    feel, for he describes them as a man who felt them himself&#8212; I have just
                    been reading <hi rend="underline">The Lord of the Isles</hi>,<note place="foot"

                    present in fashion, &amp; the high price given for Quarto Poems tempts so many
                    of our poets to write themselves down. I think you can hardly name one who has
                    not rather lessened than increased his fame by his last performance. The scene
                    in the hut of the Banditti &amp; the death of Allan &amp; the quarrel at the
                    nuptial feast are however striking, but I can hardly think verses poured out
                    with such rapidity will go down to posterity </p>
