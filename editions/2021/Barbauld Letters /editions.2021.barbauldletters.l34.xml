                    Withering more than I can easily express for your kind letter, for it has set my

                    in still greater anxiety for your general health&#8212;I am very happy that

                    Miss Baillie’s new Vol of Plays. Her fine mind, her poetical genius, her
                    delicate touches of all the chaste sensibilities of the heart are equally
                    conspicuous in this as in all her former works. I think the <hi rend="underline"

                    the passion of fear is not so pleasing a one for delineation as many others<note

                    Miss Seward’s letters I think exactly as you do. She had certainly a
                    great deal of real talent, pity it was so disgraced by affectation. What hurts
                    one most in the letters is the idea that on occasions the most affecting, as the
                    illness of her father the death of her Sister, she took <hi rend="underline"

                    that they have been retouched &amp; burnished so as to be pretty different from
                    those her correspondents really recieved<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                        letters of Anna Seward (1747–1809) were published by her literary executor,
                        Walter Scott, in 1811, in texts that were widely suspected to have been
                        "improved" by her.</note>&#8212;many personalities also hav[e] been
                    suppressed. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Edgeworth, I understand, when he heard of the
                    intended publication wrote a letter threatening vengeance if his name was
                    introduced in any way.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Richard Lovell

                        enemies.</note> Accordingly it is not, tho I have <del rend="overstrike"
