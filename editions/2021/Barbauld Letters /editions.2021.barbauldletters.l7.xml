                    letters, has certainly the fault you point out. Richardson, I believe,
                    introduced it, &amp; it has the advantage when well managed of giving an air of
                    life &amp; truth to the narrative &amp; making the characters, as it were, show
                    themselves. S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Charles is so perfect &amp; withal so cool,
