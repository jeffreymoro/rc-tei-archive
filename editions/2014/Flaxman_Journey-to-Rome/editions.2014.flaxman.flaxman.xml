  <p rend="noCount">Saturday — after an excellent Night's Rest &amp; eke a Breakfast — the Dr friend Elliot Flaxman Lyd &amp; Self ventur'd in a little Skiff across part of the ocean to view the Packet Boat (which lay at some distance) &amp; to chuse a Cabin for our whole Company to be together —</p>
  <p rend="noCount">Now view us all (except Dr. B) for the first time in our lives on the Spacious Sea pretty rough also, one minute the head of the Boat pointing to the Skies &amp; the next threatening to Plunge us in the Deep, here also my Talent for singing (small as it is) was my best Friend &amp; kept away dismal thoughts of drowning we at length got on Board much pleas'd with our little voyage as also with the Ship which was a new one &amp; prettily accomodated — Our heads soon became as windmills in full sail &amp; in less than 5 minutes the Sea took full vengeance on poor me for having disturb'd her waves — Flaxman was also in a very bad way &amp; Lydia pale as a Ghost we therefore made the best of our way into the little Boat &amp; hasten'd to the welcome shore — the minute we set foot to Land we were all well again &amp; remain'd <pb n="2v"></pb> Some time on the Beach from whence we view'd the Beauteous Ocean without Despight but not without some Dread of what we were likely to undergo when next we trusted ourselves to her uncertain Motion as the Packet was not to set off till Seven in the Evening we wander'd about Brighton &amp; saw the Prince of Wales house which is neat but rather in a poor taste<note resp="editors" n="3" place="foot">The Marine Pavilion, designed for the Prince in 1787 by <ref target="editions.2014.flaxman.artistlist.html#holland">Henry Holland</ref>, in the French neoclassical style.</note> we saw the Beaux &amp; Belles of the Place — return'd to our Inn &amp; din'd, and then began our Embarkation for the Continent — about half past five O Clock we got into the Ship's boat — (as before) &amp; to do away Serious or Impertinent Reflexion we join'd a full Chorus in Thomson's fine Song of "Rule Brittania" and should have been perfectly merry all the way to the Ship but for some Company who got into the Boat a little after a Gentleman &amp; Lady of some appearance &amp; is generally the Case when Fashion made her approach <emph>Dame Nature</emph> modestly retir'd &amp; with her <emph>Comfort</emph> her beloved handmaid —</p>
      <p rend="noCount">we reach'd the vessel mute &amp; pensive — scrambled to our Beds Immediately and as Immediately fell Sick we could not remain on Deck as it began to rain in about an hour the Boat return'd with more Passengers &amp; before Eight O'Clock we weigh'd anchor — It Rain'd hard — Blew hard was a terrible rough Sea the wind full against us the Night dark &amp; the Mariners not Knowing to what Port the vessel bent her way and in <pb n="3"></pb> this Situation, were we dying with Sickness tossing in our Beds all Complaining no one could assist another but the Dr. &amp; he Comforted us all as well as he could There were Men groaning women moaning Children roaring &amp; Flaxman Snoring no Consolation but Brandy &amp; water for twenty four hours when they happily espied Land the wind having tack'd in our favor, which in a few hours drove us to the wish'd for Port Lyd &amp; Self with the Dr. &amp; Mr. Elliott got on deck as soon as we heard this welcome news, nor was the sight of the Sea &amp; the word Thalases<note resp="editors" n="4" place="foot">Xenophon's <title level="m">Anabasis</title> tells of the fleeing army shouting "Thalassa, thalassa" (the sea, the sea) and bursting into tears of joy when they finally spotted the Black Sea.</note> more acceptable to the weary army of Xenophon on their return to Greece than was the appearance of the Shore &amp; the word Land to our longing Ears It was between 7 &amp; 8 O Clock when a Pilot Boat came to meet us fill'd with Figures in red Caps &amp; who at another time would almost have scared us with their near approach — to these Men did we commit ourselves, in their arms were we Convey'd on Shore &amp; with joyful hearts did we scramble up the Beach &amp; gain the Uncouth yet hospitable Inn held out for our Reception —</p>

      <p rend="noCount">having prov'd fortunate thus far We were embolden'd to descend once more into the Kitchen to see if we could find anything to make a Supper of — by that means to save our own provision for some future disaster; Dame Fortune presented herself to us in the form of some Ducks &amp; Eals so we made a bargain with our hosts brother who we found a very Civil fellow full of Apologies that he could not treat us in a more worthy manner — with him I agreed to give 4 Pauls a head &amp; desir'd him to make us up two or 3 little hot Dishes as clean as he could, of what he had — after some persuasion we got some warm water &amp; made some hot Rum &amp; water to warm us, &amp; in some degree <add resp="author" type="insertion" >{to}</add> stupify our senses that we might be the better match against the Liliputian though numerous Enemies we suspected would attack us in the Night season — in about an hour and a half great preparation was made to get things a little in order for supper we had frequent renovations of fire — being about 2 handfulls of wood ashes in a Pot lid — however we at last got a decent Supper Consisting of Lintel [lentil] soup, stew'd Pidgeons, stew'd Eals &amp; part of a duckling stew'd with onions &amp;c but really very good &amp; with tolerable decency, Our good Landlord's Brother brought us an unexpected desert of dried Figs &amp; Apples — Express'd his wish to satisfie us in the best way he could sat down &amp; gossop'd with us during our repast &amp; supplied us with more hot water to mix with our Rum — &amp; wish'd us good night with all this we were perfectly well satisfied but not so <pb n="55v"></pb> with what happen'd afterward our chamber had neither fireplace Casement or Door, so we agreed to keep watch by Turns but after a short time all growing sleepy we agreed that we were among honest people &amp; therefore might all venture to sleep at once but thought it most advisable to lay down with our Cloaths on to defend us the more against our second rate Enemies, but all in vain nor Cloaths, nor Rum &amp; water avail'd us anything, the stings of Consciens [conscience] were too strong to permit us much Rest, we ardently wish'd for daylight to discover what kind our Enemies were but when that appear'd they fled or rather hopp'd away after a most excellent repast on our poor Bodies Legs &amp; arms leaving behind them visible marks of their late Usurpation we gladly rose &amp; after drinking some chocolate we joyfully turn'd our Backs on this Hovel which was rather ungrateful considering the timely Asylum it has prov'd to us in time of very need but if it was so bad to us for one night what must it be for these poor wretches to endure continually, how many of them we had depriv'd of Bedding by occupying the 2 Beds ourselves I know not, but the Kitchen &amp; the stairs seem'd thickly Inhabited, I frequently heard them snoring at no great distance from the doorway of our Room —</p>
