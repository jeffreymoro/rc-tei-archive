               <h2><span class="head">About this Edition</span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">Ann Flaxman's <em>An Uninteresting Detail of a Journey to Rome</em> tells the story of a female Grand Tour, something quite rare, and of an extended
                  artist's visit to Italy, something quite common. In 1787 Flaxman set out for France
                  and Italy with her husband, the sculptor John Flaxman, and a small company of fellow
                  travellers. During her journey and in the months that followed her arrival in Rome,
                  Flaxman kept a perceptive and entertaining journal for the benefit of friends at home,
                  a group that included William and Catherine Blake. Personal yet nonetheless typical
                  of its genre, Flaxman's previously unpublished <em>Journey</em> serves as an excellent introduction to English travel writing just before the French
                  Revolution, and to the late-eighteenth-century international arts scene. It also reveals
                  the challenges and rewards of being an atypically poor traveller and an aspiring woman
                  writer.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Ann Flaxman's <em>Journey to Italy</em> is reproduced by permission of the British Library, where it is Additional Manuscript
                  39787.</p>
               <p class="noCount">The journal is a vellum-bound notebook 8½ inches (22 cm) high by 6 inches (15.5 cm)
                  wide on good paper. The front cover bears the inscription <em>Journal</em>, which has been scribbled out and <em>Journey to Rome</em> substituted, in a large and elegant hand. The back cover is labelled <em>Journal to Rome</em>. Page one is headed with the title chosen for this <em>Romantic Circles</em> edition. Inside, the writing is initially neat, growing somewhat more cramped and
                  messy as the journey progresses. Most pages bear insertions, usually in the same hand
                  and ink as the main text, and many pages use side or bottom notes to add to the material
                  in the text. In addition to the <em>Journey to Rome</em> the notebook contains three other documents: notes on a volume of Lalande, as discussed
                  in the Introduction; three short accounts of visits to Frescati, included here; and
                  a transcription of the story of Bianca Capella. The Lalande and Bianca Capella excerpts
                  appear to be translation exercises and are omitted from this edition.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Flaxman's text has been reproduced as faithfully as possible. Her inconsistent spelling
                  and capitalization pose few struggles for modern readers. More challenging is her
                  neglect of end stops or periods: she sometimes ends sentences with a dash or a comma,
                  sometimes leaves a space or starts a new line, and sometimes simply continues to the
                  next thought. Other punctuation is similarly eccentric. All abbreviations have been
                  kept except superscripts (e.g., raised "g" for "ing"), which have been written out;
                  where an abbreviation might be confusing, the missing letters have been added in square
                  brackets (e.g., F[laxman]). The double-s character has been converted to "ss." Paragraph
                  breaks have been kept.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Illegible text is indicated with <span class="unclear">[?unclear][?]</span>, illegible deletions with <span class="strikethrough">[. . .]</span>. Flaxman often left blanks to be filled in later, perhaps with help from a guidebook;
                  where these are not filled in, they are indicated by <span class="gap"> [...]</span>. Blank pages are so noted. Insertions, of which there are many, are indicated with
                  brackets: like this when made by Flaxman <span class="add">⟨{insertion}⟩</span>, and like this when added editorially <span class="add">⟨[insertion]⟩</span>. Deletions are indicated by strikethrough font: <span class="strikethrough">deletion</span>. Omitted letters or words, when obvious, are inserted in square brackets. Accidentally
                  repeated words have been silently deleted.</p>
               <p class="noCount">All substantive marginal glosses and all marginal dates have been kept. Marginal glosses
                  merely indicating location have been omitted. Because Flaxman's spellings of locations
                  and proper names are often approximate, modern spellings have been added in square
                  brackets after the first reference to a place or person. </p>
               <p class="noCount">Flaxman includes footnotes on most pages of her manuscript, expanding on points in
                  her text or adding something thought of later. These have been marked <span style="font-weight:bold">Author's Note</span>.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Pagination is marked by British Library folio numbers in superscript at the start
                  of each folio side.</p>

               <p class="noCount">This edition was TEI-encoded by Patrick Murray-John, Research Assistant Professor
                  at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University,
                  and Michael Quilligan, Site Manager at <em>Romantic Circles</em>, with assistance by David Rettenmaier. Michael Quilligan also designed the accompaning
                  graphic banners. Laura Mandell and Dave Rettenmaier developed the modified versions
                  of the transforms provided by the TEI that were used to convert the TEI files into
                  HTML. TEI renders text archival quality for better preservation and future access.

               <h2><span class="head">Acknowledgments</span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">Like any edition, this project owes its biggest debt to a host of wondrously helpful
                  librarians. My thanks to the staff of the British Library, especially in the Manuscripts
                  collection; Dr. Andrea Frederickson, Curator of the University College London art
                  collection, and the staff of the UCL Special Collections Library; Judee Showalter
                  of Randolph-Macon College's Casanova Collection; the staff of the Prints and Books
                  division at the National Art Library of the Victoria and Albert Museum; and the staff
                  of the Rare Books and Manuscripts collection of the Yale Center for British Art. Special
                  thanks to the expert staff at the University of Mary Washington's Simpson Library,
                  and especially to interlibrary loan librarian Carla Bailey.</p>
               <p class="noCount">I am indebted to the late Charles Theodore Houpt for his generosity and his decades-long
                  passion for the Flaxmans. His self-published transcription of many of the Flaxman
                  letters was an invaluable resource. Liane R. Houghtalin and Federico Schneider provided
                  crucial translation assistance. Marjorie A. Och taught me to cite works of art correctly.
                  Patrick Murray-John patiently introduced me to TEI encoding and contributed more than
                  I can say to this edition. All transcription and annotation errors are my own.</p>
               <p class="noCount">This project was completed with the help of a sabbatical and a faculty development
                  grant from the University of Mary Washington.</p>
