                  some degree of perturbation towards that enterprize — Post off in good spirits about
                  9 O'Clock from Naples. We gave a friendly look at the statues in the 2 Courtyards
                  at Portici &amp; turn'd to our left towards the Mountain the Muleteers accosted us by
                  dozens &amp; after much altercation 3 mules were pitch'd on &amp; the price settled which

                  &amp; left the Mules with a Boy &amp; proceeded on foot with the guide who undertook the care
                  of me the men having thick clubs to sustain themselves on the which sank pretty deep
                  in the sandy Bottom as did our feet I found myself fairly cover'd to the calves of

                  of sand that got into them in some places I mounted Heroically alone with the help
                  of a Club but in others I was forc'd to submit to lay hold of the Guides Girdle &amp;
                  let him lug me up often resting for Breath &amp; Strength but never for Courage having
                  once begun the ascent — </p>
               <p class="noCount">for the most part we lost half of our Labour by the sand giving way so much at every
                  step — when we came to the top of the first Mountain we descended a little to begin
                  the second Cone which led to the mouth the ground began to be very hot &amp; of a Brimstone
                  Color — the smell became strong &amp; the smoke offensive, particularly when the wind
                  blew it in our faces, Flaxman halted within about <span class="gap"> [...]</span> yards of the top &amp; honestly I myself gave way when I was within about ten &amp; chiefly
                  owing to a great puff of <span class="add">⟨{sulphureous}⟩</span> smoke that came across me &amp; allmost took away my Breath, however the Guide &amp; the
                  Major Insisted on my Proceeding which I did &amp; past the smoke by holding out a handkerchief
                  to my mouth &amp; nose &amp; thus by the help of the Guide I went to the very Edge &amp; look'd
                  down into the first <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4424">[Page 71v]</span> hollow which I clearly saw was red &amp; yellow by the wind blowing the Smoke for a few
                  minutes on the other side as if on purpose the smoke rose perpendicularly, for some
                  yards from the internal mouth which was at the bottom of the Cap &amp; then was dispers'd
                  according to the winds pleasure — a few minutes observation satisfied my curiosity
                  as I found it rather difficult to breathe surrounded by so much Sulphur I pick'd up
                  a piece of the sulphureous matter which was rather too hot too hold however I manag'd
                  to keep it &amp; <span class="strikethrough">[. . .]</span> with a double satisfaction turn'd my Back on this Curiosity, however I was very unwilling
                  that Flaxman should descend with having to say that he had <span class="add">⟨[not]⟩</span> been at the top therefore we persuaded him to go with the Guide &amp; we would wait where
                  we had left him &amp; take a view of the surrounding Country which from that height was
                  beautiful we had at once an Extensive view of the sea which was perhaps about 2 miles
                  from us — the little Towns of Portici Nola &amp; several others that lay scatter'd about,

                  with some oranges as we sat on a large block of white stone which Vesuvious had thrown
                  up in some of her Passions — &amp; after a good rest we began to descend, this we found
                  much easier than <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4450">[Page 72]</span> our ascent for what was then our misfortune prov'd now otherwise inasmuch as the

                  keep pace with us sometimes in our mislidings we found ourselves seated upon our Bottoms

                  ourselves &amp; we were very glad to find our Patient Mules at the bottom of this Declivity
                  where we had left them we mounted their Backs &amp; descended the rest of the Mountain

                  we should have found a Hermitage about half way up where we should have found a friendly
                  monk who would have regal'd us with wine grapes &amp;c but this particular we forgot and
                  Ignorantly mounted by a more unfrequented path which I think they say is shorter but
                  rather more difficult but this was the choice of our Conductor Shoes stockings legs

                     omissions as it goes along. Among the topics covered are the ceremonies for inducting
                     a pope, holy week ceremonies, the population and great families of Rome, the cost
                     of living, food and drink, Roman social life (of which Lalande disapproves), cicisbeos,
