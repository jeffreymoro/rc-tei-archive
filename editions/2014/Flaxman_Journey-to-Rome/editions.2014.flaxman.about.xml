         <head>About this Edition</head>
               <p rend="noCount">Ann Flaxman's <title level="m">An Uninteresting Detail of a Journey to Rome</title> tells the story of a female Grand Tour, something quite rare, and of an extended artist's visit to Italy, something quite common. In 1787 Flaxman set out for France and Italy with her husband, the sculptor John Flaxman, and a small company of fellow travellers. During her journey and in the months that followed her arrival in Rome, Flaxman kept a perceptive and entertaining journal for the benefit of friends at home, a group that included William and Catherine Blake. Personal yet nonetheless typical of its genre, Flaxman's previously unpublished <title level="m">Journey</title> serves as an excellent introduction to English travel writing just before the French Revolution, and to the late-eighteenth-century international arts scene. It also reveals the challenges and rewards of being an atypically poor traveller and an aspiring woman writer.</p>
               <p rend="noCount">Ann Flaxman's <title level="m">Journey to Italy</title> is reproduced by permission of the British
                  Library, where it is Additional Manuscript 39787. </p>
               <p rend="noCount">The journal is a vellum-bound notebook 8½ inches (22 cm) high by 6 inches (15.5 cm) wide
                  on good paper. The front cover bears the inscription <title level="m">Journal</title>, which has
                  been scribbled out and <title level="m">Journey to Rome</title> substituted, in a large and elegant
                  hand. The back cover is labelled <title level="m">Journal to Rome</title>. Page one is headed with the title chosen for this <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title> edition. Inside, the writing is
                  initially neat, growing somewhat more cramped and messy as the journey progresses. Most
                  pages bear insertions, usually in the same hand and ink as the main text, and many pages
                  use side or bottom notes to add to the material in the text. In addition to the
                  <title level="m">Journey to Rome</title> the notebook contains three other documents: notes on a
                  volume of Lalande, as discussed in the Introduction; three short accounts of visits to
                  Frescati, included here; and a transcription of the story of Bianca Capella. The Lalande
                  and Bianca Capella excerpts appear to be translation exercises and are omitted from this
                  edition.</p>
               <p rend="noCount">Flaxman's text has been reproduced as faithfully as possible. Her inconsistent spelling
                  and capitalization pose few struggles for modern readers. More challenging is her neglect
                  of end stops or periods: she sometimes ends sentences with a dash or a comma, sometimes
                  leaves a space or starts a new line, and sometimes simply continues to the next thought.
                  Other punctuation is similarly eccentric. All abbreviations have been kept except
                  superscripts (e.g., raised "g" for "ing"), which have been written out; where an
                  abbreviation might be confusing, the missing letters have been added in square brackets
                  (e.g., F[laxman]). The double-s character has been converted to "ss." Paragraph breaks
                  have been kept.</p>
               <p rend="noCount">Illegible text is indicated with <unclear>[?unclear]</unclear>, illegible deletions with <del type="illegible">[. . .]</del>. Flaxman
                  often left blanks to be filled in later, perhaps with help from a guidebook; where these
                  are not filled in, they are indicated by <gap
                     resp="author"></gap>. Blank pages are so noted. Insertions, of
                  which there are many, are indicated with brackets: like this when made by Flaxman <add resp="author">{insertion}</add>, and like this when added editorially  <add resp="editors">[insertion]</add>. Deletions are
                  indicated by strikethrough font: <del>deletion</del>. Omitted letters or words, when obvious, are
                  inserted in square brackets. Accidentally repeated words have been silently deleted.</p>
               <p rend="noCount">All substantive marginal glosses and all marginal dates have been kept. Marginal glosses
                  merely indicating location have been omitted. Because Flaxman's spellings of locations and
                  proper names are often approximate, modern spellings have been added in square brackets
                  after the first reference to a place or person. </p>
               <p rend="noCount">Flaxman includes footnotes on most pages of her manuscript, expanding on points in her
                  text or adding something thought of later. These have been marked <hi rend="bold">Author's Note</hi>.</p>
               <p rend="noCount">Pagination is marked by British Library folio numbers in superscript at the start of
                  each folio side.</p></div>

                  <p rend="noCount">This edition was TEI-encoded by Patrick Murray-John, Research Assistant Professor at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University, and Michael Quilligan, Site Manager at <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title>, with assistance by David Rettenmaier. Michael Quilligan also designed the accompaning graphic banners. Laura Mandell and Dave Rettenmaier developed the modified versions of the transforms provided by the TEI that were used to convert the TEI files into HTML. TEI renders text archival quality for better preservation and future access.

               <head>Acknowledgments</head>
               <p rend="noCount">Like any edition, this project owes its biggest debt to a host of wondrously helpful
                  librarians. My thanks to the staff of the British Library, especially in the Manuscripts
                  collection; Dr. Andrea Frederickson, Curator of the University College London art
                  collection, and the staff of the UCL Special Collections Library; Judee Showalter of
                  Randolph-Macon College's Casanova Collection; the staff of the Prints and Books division
                  at the National Art Library of the Victoria and Albert Museum; and the staff of the Rare
                  Books and Manuscripts collection of the Yale Center for British Art. Special thanks to the
                  expert staff at the University of Mary Washington's Simpson Library, and especially to
                  interlibrary loan librarian Carla Bailey.</p>
               <p rend="noCount">I am indebted to the late Charles Theodore Houpt for his generosity and his decades-long
                  passion for the Flaxmans. His self-published transcription of many of the Flaxman letters
                  was an invaluable resource. Liane R. Houghtalin and Federico Schneider provided crucial
                  translation assistance. Marjorie A. Och taught me to cite works of art correctly. Patrick
                  Murray-John patiently introduced me to TEI encoding and contributed more than I can say to
                  this edition. All transcription and annotation errors are my own.</p>
               <p rend="noCount">This project was completed with the help of a sabbatical and a faculty development grant
               from the University of Mary Washington.</p>
