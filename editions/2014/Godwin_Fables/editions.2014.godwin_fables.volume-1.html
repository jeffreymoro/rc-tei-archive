                              Godwin inserted himself into a long tradition that included Sir Roger L'Estrange's
                              Fables of Aesop and Other Eminent Mythologists (1692), Samuel Croxall's The Fables

                              in Three Books (ca. 1800) among others.</span></div>

                     is not a reader of penetration, I will briefly mention what these features are.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>I have long thought that fables were the happiest vehicle which could be devised for
                     the instruction of children in the first period of their education. The stories are
                     short; a simple and familiar turn of incident runs through them; and the mediums of
                     instruction they employ are animals, some of the first objects with which the eyes
                     and the curiosity of children are conversant.

                              throughout the eighteenth century debated the merits of fables for young children.
                              In Some Thoughts Concerning Education (1692), John Locke deemed Aesop's fables to
                              be ideal reading for children because they were both educational and entertaining.
                              In Émile, ou de l'Éducation (1762), however, Jean Jacques Rousseau denounced fables
                              as inappropriate for young children whom, he argued, would not understand their allegorical
                              nature. Unlike Locke, Rousseau argues that fables tend to mislead in the course of
                              amusing…</span></div>
                     </div> Yet these advantages are too often defeated by the manner in which fables are written,

                              that proffered in Aesop's fables—long before he opened the Juvenile Library. In The
                              Enquirer. Reflections on Education, Manners, and Literature. In a Series of Essays
                              (London: 1797), Godwin criticizes the Aesop's fables currently available to readers
                              for their attached morals, which he finds do not logically connect to the story itself:
                              "Nothing is more futile, than the formal and regular moral frequently annexed to Esop's
                              fables of animals. Examine the fable impartially, and you will find that the lesson

                              While Rousseau felt that fables were too complex for children's literal-minded capacities,
                              Godwin believed that the fables currently available were too simple in their construction.
                              The Aesop's fables edited by Robert Dodsley, Croxall, and L'Estrange are significantly
                              shorter than those written by Godwin, typically no more than a paragraph or two of
                              actual narrative, and are devoid of the elaborate details Godwin adds.</span></div>
                     </div> This is wrong; it is not thus that children are instructed. If we would benefit a
                     child, we must become in part a child ourselves. We must prattle to him; we must expatiate
                     upon some points; we must introduce quick, unexpected turns, which, if they are not
                     wit, have the effect of wit to children. Above all, we must make our narrations pictures,
                     and render the objects we discourse about, visible to the fancy of the learner.

                              in the visual aspects of Aesop's fables. Dodsley and Croxall's Fables, for example,
                              introduced each story with an illustration, likely in response to Locke's recommendation.
                              Locke felt that Aesop's fables should be illustrated, both to render the stories more
                              entertaining for children and to give children a means of visualizing the animals
                              discussed, many of which were exotic animals that children were unlikely to have seen.
                              While Godwin's version does include an illustration at the beginning of each story,

                     and have expressed them in such language as I should have been likely to employ, when
                     I wished to amuse the child, and make what I was talking of take hold upon his attention.

                              himself as a storyteller. The frontispiece to Fables is an image of Godwin telling
                              a story to a child in his lap and a group of children at his feet. This image was
                              also made into a sign that hung over the door of his bookshop on Skinner Street.</span></div>

                     question he asks, when he has finished his reading, if he is at all interested in
                     the tale, is, What became of the poor dog, the fox, or the wolf? While the stories
                     were told with the customary dryness, this was not of much importance; but, the moment
                     a character of reality was given to the narrative, it cried aloud for correction.
                     I have accordingly endeavoured to make almost all my narratives end in a happy and

                     specific idea to his mind. I have endeavoured never to forget, that the book I was

                     thinking that was a nice, snug place for him to lie down and sleep in. Presently a
                     little boy came into the stable, leading his papa's horse, that had been ploughing
                     a whole field, and was very tired, and very hungry. Come out, poor fellow! said the
                     little boy to the dog, papa's horse wants to eat some hay. But the naughty dog never
                     stirred a bit; he only made up an ugly face, and snarled very much. The little boy
                     went close up to him, and endeavoured to take him out; but then the naughty dog barked
                     and growled, and even tried to bite the little boy. The little boy was not big enough
                     to manage such an ill-natured cur; so he turned in the horse, and stood by to see
                     what would happen. The horse looked very hungry, and very tired, and put up his head
                     to the rack to get a mouthful of hay. But the naughty dog snapped at the poor horse's
                     mouth. The horse was very sorry, and would have said, Pray dog, let me eat! if he
                     had been able.

                              feared that children would erroneously believe that talking animals existed in real

                              —William Mavor explains that wolves were systematically eradicated in England during
                              the reign of Edward I (1272 – 1307), with the last wolf killed in Scotland in 1680

                     for fear the wolf should come and eat them up. In the times I am thinking of, nobody
                     had invented a plough; so there was no corn. The wild men then kept sheep; they had
                     mutton for their dinner, but neither turnips nor bread to eat with it. Men staid all
                     day with the flocks, to take care that they did not lose themselves, and that the
                     wolves did not come to eat them; for wolves were always very fond of mutton, and,
                     when they were hungry, would come and kill a sheep or a little lamb for their dinner.
                     A wolf had at any time rather have a lamb than a child. Sometimes when the men were
                     very busy, mending the thatch, or cutting down fire-wood (for there were no coals
                     and no tiles), they would send their children, boys of ten or twelve years old, like
                     Charles, to take care of the flocks of sheep.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The boy I am going to tell you about, was a very naughty boy, and his father and mother
                  could never make him do as he was bid. He was always laughing when he should have
                  been minding his lesson; and he often did mischief and thought it a very good joke.
                  Says his father to him one day, Winter will soon be here, and I must go to the forest
                  and cut some fire-wood: you are hardly big enough yet to take care of the sheep, but
                  I must trust you to look after them. That I will, father! says the boy, for he was
                  proud to be of some importance. I and three or four of my neighbours, said the father,
                  shall be within call, and if you want any help, you must bawl to us as lustily as
                  you can.</p>
               <p>Away went the boy, and took the sheep-dog with him, and drove the flock to pasture.
                  He sat down upon a hillock to look at them; he patted his dog, and when any of the
                  lambs straggled from the rest, he sent the dog to bark at them, and make them come
                  back. </p>
               <p>This was all very well; but presently he thought, Now I will have a joke. Every thing
                  was quiet about him, when he set up a great scream, Father, father, the wolf, the
                  wolf is coming. Away ran the father and the neighbours, leaving their work, some with
                  sticks, and some with hatchets, to help the poor boy and drive away the wolf. When
                  they came, all was quiet, and the boy burst into a great laugh, to think he had made
                  a fool of his father. His father was very angry, and said, Child, how could you call
                  us away from our work, and tell us a lie? I could not have thought it of you. But
                  the naughty boy did not mind. </p>
               <p>The next day the father went again to the forest, and sent his son to mind the sheep.
                  Presently he began to cry, The wolf, the wolf! and every thing happened as before,
                  except that his father was this time more angry, and told him he should go to bed
                  without his supper. But the silly boy was still pleased with himself, that he had
                  once more, as he called it, made a fool of his father. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It was now almost evening, and the sun began to set, when the naughty boy saw two
                     great, fierce wolves running toward him as fast as they could. He was terribly frightened;
                     and by ill luck the dog had gone after a rabbit or a bird, and could no where be seen.
                     The boy screamed dismally: The wolf, the wolf, Oh father, the wolf! Then he ran to
                     beat the wild beasts with his crook; but they scared him, and he ran back again. Then
                     he screamed more and more. His father and the wood-cutters heard him plain enough,
                     but they said, It is only that mischievous boy; he shall make fools of us no more.
                     So the wolves ate up so many of the flock, that the father was ruined, and obliged
                     to part with the rest, and go a-begging: and, when the boy grew up to be a man, people
                     still pointed at him, and said, That is the son, that told lies, and ruined his father.

                  Some stories are true, and some are invented; and, if they are very prettily invented,
                  we are much obliged to the people that made them. A lie is what naughty folks say,
                  that they may deceive; like the boy and the wolf. But, if I tell a pretty story of
                  a dog and a fox, or any other animals, I do not mean to deceive, I only mean to tell
                  a pretty story. Now then I begin.</p>
               <p>An ant is a very wise, though a very little animal, and lays up food in the summer
                  when there is plenty, against the winter when there is none. He is thoughtful and
                  serious. A grasshopper is the merriest creature in the world; he sings all the summer
                  long; but, when the winter comes, he dies of hunger and cold.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>A grasshopper, as the story says, at the beginning of a hard winter, happened to meet
                     an ant. The grasshopper was very hungry. He looked at the ant, as much as to say,
                     You are a very wise animal, and have got a store-house full of corn. He then plucked
                     up a spirit, and cried in a melancholy tone, Pray, Mr. Ant, give me a grain of your
                     corn! That I will, said the ant, and fetched him a little. But do not come to me any
                     more; perhaps you may find other charitable ants not far off another day. I have only
                     enough to last my own family, who all helped in collecting it. Ants are very sorry
                     to see other animals starve, but animals that can work for themselves, and will not,
                     and, as the saying is, do not make hay while the sun shines, cannot always expect
                     to have their idleness maintained by our industry. People will think much better of
                     a creature that is sober and pains-taking in time, than of one that, for want of taking

                     he crumbled for their breakfast.</p>

               <p>One day as this good hermit was taking a pleasant walk, he heard the groans of an
                  animal in pain. He looked through the bushes, and saw a vast, overgrown bear stretched
                  at the foot of a tree. At first he was rather alarmed; but, when he looked a little
                  longer, he saw the bear was very ill. He then came round and showed himself; and the
                  bear looked at him in a pitiful manner, and held up his foot. The hermit saw that
                  it was very sore, and very much swelled. The poor creature had somehow got a hurt
                  in it a week before, and it had grown worse and worse, till the bear could not walk.
                  The bear could not go for victuals, and victuals did not come to the bear, so that
                  he was in danger of being starved. The hermit took compassion on the animal; he ran
                  and got water and washed his foot; he put a little balsam to it that he had in his
                  pocket, and then fetched him something to eat. He now visited the bear every day,
                  till he was well enough to walk. </p>

                     much like it; he would have been better pleased with a dog for his companion; but
                     the bear did it all out of love. When they came home, the bear would stay and live
                     with the hermit. Bears are clever animals, and can do many tricks; though naughty
                     people use them very cruelly, pretending to teach them to dance.

                  the hermit, and lighted on his face, and tickled him. The old man shook his head,
                  but did not awake: the bear growled, but the hermit was in a sound sleep, and the
                  flies did not care for his growlings. At last one saucy fly pitched upon the old man's
                  nose. Now, thought the bear, I shall have you; and with that he took up his paw to
                  give the fly a good knock. The fly was killed; but the poor hermit's nose was terribly
                  bruised, and after a time turned quite black. Immediately the hermit awoke, and began
                  to be very angry; but he put up his hand to his nose, and the dead fly fell upon it:
                  he then knew what the bear had been doing. Go, go, said he to the bear, shaking his
                  head with the pain; I will always do you all the good I can, but we will not live
                  together any more. He that admits into his company an awkward and ill-matched favourite,

               <h2><span class="head">THE FOX AND THE RAVEN.</span></h2>
               <p><span class="smcap">There</span> are a great many fables about foxes. A fox is a little animal, hardly so big as a
                  middle-sized dog. He lives in the woods, and is never tamed. He is very fond of fowls
                  and geese, and steals them, whenever he can, for his dinner. The farmers therefore
                  are his great enemies; for they do not like, when they have been at the trouble and
                  expense of breeding the poultry, that the fox should come and eat them up. The fox
                  however is a cunning little fellow; he is full of stratagems and wiles; and when we
                  speak of any body that is very sly, it is usual to say, He is as cunning as a fox.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>A fox, as Esop says, happened one day to be very hungry. He was walking along quite
                     serious, for people are apt to be serious when they are hungry.

                              but hunger was still a very real threat, especially in London, due to substandard
                              wheat harvests and wartime price gouging. See for example Walter M. Stern, "The Bread
                              Crisis in Britain, 1795-96," Economica, New Series 31, no. 122 (May 1964): 168-187

                     </div> He spied a raven perched in a tree, with a delicate cheese in his beak. I suppose
                     this cheese must have been about the size of a baked apple; I believe they make such
                     in some countries.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The fox thought with himself, I dare say that is a very nice cheese; I wish I could
                  taste it. But what could he do? The raven sat upon a high branch; the fox did not
                  know how to climb to him. If the raven would consent to fight for the cheese, the
                  fox perhaps could have beaten him. But, suppose the raven had been upon the ground,
                  he had fine large wings and could have flown away with the cheese. </p>
               <p>While the fox was thinking thus, he fixed his eyes on the raven. What a beautiful
                  bird you are! says he. I never saw any thing so glossy as your shining, black feathers.
                  What a twist you have with your neck! And what a noble beak! I dare say it holds that
                  cheese as tight as if it was a pair of pincers. Do you know that I think you the finest
                  bird I ever saw; and, if your singing is but equal to the manner in which you hold
                  yourself, the nightingale must be nothing to you. </p>
               <p>Now you must know that the only noise a raven can make is as frightful a scream as
                  you every heard. Whenever he begins, I am always disposed to put my fingers to my
                  ears. But this silly bird was delighted with the fine speeches of the fox; he knew
                  that his feathers were as black as the cunning creature said, and that he had a good,
                  handsome beak of his own; and he began to think that perhaps he might be a fine singer
                  too. So he tuned his pipes to try; the cheese dropt out of his beak; this was all
                  the fox wanted; he caught it up, and ran away with it, and left the raven to sing
                  to the crows. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Foxes are never taught what is good and what is naughty. But, if I were a little boy
                     or a little girl, I would rather go without cheese all the days of my life, than gain
                     it by such cheating and wicked speeches as this fox is said to have made.

               <h2><span class="head">THE FOX AND THE STORK.</span></h2>
               <p><span class="smcap">A fox</span> one day invited a stork to dinner. The good-natured stork was pleased with the civility,
                  and had no doubt that the invitation was meant in kindness. But the fox intended no
                  such thing; he had nothing in his head but the hope to make game of an animal, who,
                  though of a remarkably sweet temper, he thought was not so wise as himself.</p>
               <p>The dinner consisted of a fine, rich soup; for foxes and storks never want but one
                  dish to a meal. The fox set it before his guest in a very broad platter, so that,
                  though there was enough of it, it was hardly more than half an inch deep. </p>
               <p>To understand the fox's joke, you must consider the different ways that beasts and
                  birds have of taking their food, and particularly what is liquid. Beasts have a long
                  tongue; look at the cat when she is drinking her milk; she puts out her tongue, and
                  laps it up in a minute. It is very droll; you could not drink your milk as she does.
                  Birds on the contrary have a long bill that they put into the cup, and suck up as
                  much as they want. Neither beasts nor birds drink as little boys and girls do. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The soup was set smoking before them; it had a fine savoury smell; and, if the stork
                     was sharp-set

                              Dictionary, this adjective was often used in this period to refer to hunting animals,
                              such as hounds or hawks.</span></div>
                     </div> before, the smell now gave strength to his appetite. He put in his bill, and the fox
                     put in his tongue; but the soup was so shallow, that the stork could scarcely suck
                     up any thing. The fox however found himself very well off, and swallowed it all in
                     less than a minute. Then they parted with many civilities, and the fox said, he hoped
                     he should soon have the pleasure to see the stork again.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The stork did not care much about the dinner; his home was not far off; he had plenty
                  there; and, spreading his wings, he soon got to a place where he could fully make
                  up his disappointment. But he was sorry to see any animal capable of so ill-natured
                  a joke. In spite of all his good temper, he was a little angry; and he determined
                  to show his inviter, that foxes are not more cunning than other animals, if they would
                  condescend to play such pitiful tricks. </p>
               <p>The next day the stork met the fox. Come, my friend, said the stork, yesterday I dined
                  with you; you must do me the pleasure to eat your mutton with me to-day. The fox consented;
                  he apprehended no trick; he said to himself, Such a good-natured creature as the stork
                  would not ask me, if he had not something nice to treat me with. </p>
               <p>The stork's dinner was meat, minced very fine, and put into a long narrow-necked bottle.
                  I beg, friend, says the stork, you will stand upon no ceremony with me; I hope you
                  will make as free as if you were at home. Saying this, he put his long beak into the
                  bottle, and quietly began his dinner. The fox did not know what to make of it; at
                  first he licked the gravy and the little morsels that ran down the side of the bottle;
                  at last he began to grow angry. He said, this was not usage for a gentleman, and he
                  would take care to remember it another time. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>I hope then, said the stork, you will remember also the dinner you gave me yesterday;

                     never be starved. Remember too this maxim, which you will find has a great deal of

                  <p><span class="smcap">You</span> have heard, I dare say, how fond some gentlemen are of riding a hunting, and what
                     a fine sport they think it is. For my part, I could never quite reconcile myself to
                     the idea of such sport. There is hare-hunting, and fox-hunting, and deer-hunting,
                     beside the hunting of lions and tigers and other ferocious animals. I think more has
                     been said about deer-hunting, than any of the rest; and there is a fine old song upon
                     that subject, called Chevy-Chase.

                              “The Ballad of Chevy Chase”
                              was well known from its inclusion in Thomas Percy's Reliques of Ancient English Poetry
                              (1765) as well as from numeous reprintings in chapbooks and collections of popular
                              songs. It recounts a great battle between a Scottish and an English earl, Lord Douglas
                              and Lord Percy. Lord Percy incites this fight by hunting deer without permission on
                              Lord Douglas's land. In the heat of combat, Lord Percy and Lord Douglas are killed
                              as well as numerous squires on both sides vowing to revenge their commanders.</span></div>
                     </div> The way is for the gentlemen, very early in the morning, to mount upon a number of
                     fine horses, which for their fleetness are called hunters, and to call out a pack
                     of dogs bred for the purpose, that are to run after the deer, and that will, when
                     they have caught it, tear it almost to pieces, if the gentlemen do not interfere.
                     As soon as the gentlemen have all got on their horses, the huntsman, or groom, blows
                     his horn, and away they ride. When they come to a field, or a proper place, the huntsman
                     makes the hounds smell all about, till they find the smell of the deer. At this time
                     of the morning, the grass is covered with dew, which the hounds brush away, as they
                     run. When they have roused the deer, the poor creature is terribly frightened, and
                     sets off as hard as he can, and the dogs after him, and the gentlemen after the dogs.
                     The deer sometimes runs forward, and sometimes almost back again, that he may get
                     rid of his pursuers; but the dogs follow him by the smell he leaves on the grass,
                     and wind backward and forward just as he does. Sometimes he takes a great jump to
                     break the line of the smell, and sometimes he swims across a river. After some hours
                     running he is generally caught at last. Poor deer!

                              century deer hunting was largely reserved for the aristocracy, as fox hunting became
                              (or was perceived as being) more popular among the landed gentry. Wild deer were all
                              but nonexistant by the eighteenth century and the large, royal deer parks were greatly
                              diminished during the English civil war, having been plundered of trees and game.
                              For the most part, deer hunters chased "carted deer," which were sold commercially
                              and brought in for the occasion. Carted deer were captured but typically not killed

                     </div> The flesh of deer is called venison, and is thought to be much better than beef and

                              meat for the majority of the British population. Deer received special protection
                              under the Game Law of 1671, which remained largely in effect throughout the eighteenth
                              and early nineteenth centuries. Under this law, game animals—hares, partridges, pheasants,
                              and moor fowl—were considered wild animals, available to anyone who had the right
                              to hunt. Deer (and later rabbits), however, were designated as private property. Thus,
                              hunting a deer without the permission of the owner of the land on which the deer was

               </div>
               <p>For my part, I do not quite like this hunting the deer. Do not you think it very cruel,
                  to call the frightening a poor creature, and at last perhaps killing him, fine sport?
                  The deer is a beautiful animal. The male is called a stag, and has grand, branching
                  horns. The female is called a hind; she has no horns, but is a very handsome, innocent-looking
                  creature. The young deer is called a fawn, and is so pretty and good-natured, that
                  ladies formerly would call the fawns to come and lie down in their chambers. The coat
                  of the deer is of a beautiful brown, sometimes a little reddish, sometimes speckled
                  and mottled with white, and, when the animal is in health, is as smooth as velvet.
                  </p>
               <p>A stag once, who had lived free and happy in the forest where he was born, after having
                  frisked about, and eaten his dinner of grass, wanted to drink. There was a pretty
                  running stream not far off, as smooth and as clear as glass. The stag knew this stream
                  very well, and had often tasted its sweet, cool waters. While he was drinking, he
                  could not help seeing himself in the stream; and, when he had done, he stopped a little
                  longer, to admire his own face, just as I have seen little girls admire themselves
                  in a glass. He nodded his head. I declare, said the stag to himself, I think I am
                  very pretty: my eyes are so bright, and my nose is so small and slender! But above
                  all, these fine branching horns, what a grace they have! I do not wonder that all
                  the young hinds should fall in love with me, and wish me for a husband. Yet I am surprised
                  they dare to be so familiar with so noble a creature, and lick my neck with their
                  tongues, as they do sometimes. </p>
               <p>The stag then began to look a little further. And yet, thought he, I do not half like
                  these legs. They are so slender and insignificant! They look like four spindles. What
                  a creature should I have been, if these pitiful shanks of mine had been answerable
                  to the majesty of my horns! </p>
               <p>The stag staid so long, considering and commenting upon his different parts and members,
                  that at last he heard the cry of the hounds. I do not know whether he had ever heard
                  it before; but animals seem from the first to know who are their enemies. The little
                  mouse ran away the very first time she saw a cat. </p>
               <p>Away started the stag, and most gloriously he scampered. He ran faster than the dogs.
                  After all, thought he, these legs are not such bad things. If they are thin and light,
                  they seem on that account only to carry me the faster. Thinking thus, he still ran
                  as hard as he could, up hill and down dale, across the high road, then into a turnip-field,
                  and next over a meadow. At last he came to a wood; and, trying to force his way through
                  it, he entangled his horns so among the bushes, that he could not get free. The hounds
                  came up: but the gentlemen were close by, and generously saved him from being mangled
                  and killed, as he otherwise would have been. </p>
               <p>Well, thought the stag, when he saw himself safe, I have learned a lesson to day,
                  that I shall remember as long as I live. Another time, when I undertake the decide
                  upon the value of a thing, I will consider, not merely whether it looks beautiful,
                  but what use is to be got from it. I now know that swift legs are more worth having,
                  than the most magnificent horns that ever were seen.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">THE TRAVELLERS AND THE MONEY-BAG.</span></h2>
               <p><span class="smcap">Two</span> poor men set off at the same time from Scotland to come to London. They found little
                  employment at home, and they had heard that their trade met with better encouragement
                  in the capital. They had very, very little money, and were obliged to go all the way
                  on foot. As they were both going to the same place, they thought they might as well
                  be company for each other.</p>
               <p>These poor men knew very little of each other before their journey. But they said,
                  we are men, and men ought to lend a helping hand to one another. If we have nothing
                  but bread and cheese to eat, it will be pleasant to sit together and eat it under
                  the same hedge. If we sleep upon straw, it will be delightful to say, <em>Good-night, Good-night</em>, before we close our eyes, and, <em>Up, fellow-traveller, and be stirring</em>, when we wake in the morning. One said, I can whistle a number of good songs; and
                  the other answered, Though I cannot whistle, I know many pretty stories, some that
                  will make you laugh heartily, and some that will almost make you cry. This was all
                  the bargain they made, and then they set out.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Nothing very particular happened the two first days, except that, as it is almost
                     impossible to travel without money, the little they had at first, was now grown less.
                     On the third day they were almost come to York. It was quite dark, when one of them
                     stumbled over something in the road, and taking it up, found it was a canvas money-bag,
                     or farmer's purse. It was heavy with money. The one who took it up was an ill-natured,
                     selfish fellow, that always wanted to keep every thing that was good to himself. Aha!
                     said he, I am in luck to-day; I have found a purse of money. Just then they passed
                     a cottage with a light in the window. Let me see, said the finder, going close to
                     the window, and looking at the money—four, five, six guineas, and nineteen shillings,
                     and I dare say a matter of five-shillings-worth of half-pence.

                  that a fellow-countryman and fellow-traveller could be so selfish and ill-natured.
                  He had not time to cry however, when they heard three or four horsemen coming along
                  the road, riding pretty fast, and yet talking very earnestly. They listened to the
                  talk, and found the horsemen were speaking of a farmer who had been robbed by highwaymen
                  as he went home from York-market, and had lost his purse, containing six guineas,
                  and nineteen shillings in silver, and five-shillings-worth of half-pence. </p>
               <p>Come along, said the selfish traveller, all in a sweat, to his companion, let us turn
                  into this wood, and hide ourselves. If they find us with the purse in our possession,
                  they will think we are the thieves, and we shall be hanged. </p>
               <p>I shall do no such thing, said the other; these people want to return it to the right
                  owner, and the right owner must have it. Besides, you are no longer a fit fellow-traveller
                  for me. You would not allow me to say, <em>We</em> have found a purse, when you thought nobody would claim it, and I do not understand
                  your saying, <em>We</em> shall be hanged, when pursuit is made after the thief.</p>
               <p>The horsemen, though they could not see the travellers, heard their voices, and called
                  to them to stop. They did so, and were questioned, and obliged to deliver up the purse.
                  It would have gone still harder with the selfish traveller, who trembled and stammered
                  so much, that they thought he was the thief; but his generous companion, who had intended
                  no harm, told a plain, honest story, that convinced the horsemen, who in consequence
                  dismissed them both. I am glad, said he, to have done you this service: we are now
                  almost at the gates of York; I shall therefore only bid you good night, and wish you
                  to-morrow, as you intended to do by me, a very pleasant walk from York to London.

                     to another, is called a fairing. Then the fair is crowded with pretty clean boys and
                     girls. They beat the drums, and squeak with the flutes; and there is such a noise,
                     you cannot think how much. Every body is in a hurry, and busy, and happy. When I was
                     a little boy, I remember I thought I never saw so charming and happy a place as a
                     village-fair.</p>
               </div>
               <p>But every body does not come to the fair for amusement; some people have very serious
                  business. The buyers are amused with their purchases; but the sellers are very grave,
                  thinking how much money they shall carry home to buy beef and mutton for their wives
                  and children. The serving-men and serving-maids come to hire themselves: servants
                  in the country always hire themselves for a year, till next fair-time, at the least;
                  and a very good servant loves his master as much as if he were his father, and is
                  as unwilling to go away from him. Then there is a field, not far from the booths,
                  where horses are bought and sold, and sometimes cows, and asses, and sheep. </p>
               <p>A miller once set off for a village-fair, about four miles from his mill, to sell
                  his ass. I am afraid this miller had grown poor, else I do not think he would have
                  sold his ass. The miller was an old man with white hairs, that walked along leaning
                  on a stick. He took with him his son, a pretty little boy, about seven years old,
                  who had a great desire to see the fair, and his father told him that, if he sold his
                  ass well, the little boy should bring home a drum. </p>
               <p>Away they went; the miller very thoughtful and very serious, for he was a seller;
                  the boy, as merry as a cricket, kissed his father's hand, and thanked him a thousand
                  times for being so good as to take him to the fair. But, Charley, my boy, said the
                  miller, you must walk all the way: I am an old man, and cannot get along without a
                  stick, and yet I shall walk: You were seven years old last birth-day. If we fatigue
                  our ass with riding upon him, he will not look handsome, and people will not believe
                  he is so good an ass as we have found him to be. We will rest for an hour or two on
                  the grass, and have a little bread and cheese and ale, before we set off to come home
                  again. </p>
               <p>Oh, father, says the little boy, I am sure I can walk very well; and, if I find myself
                  a little tired in coming home, I will beat upon my new drum, and the sound of that
                  will make me as fresh as if I had not moved a step. </p>
               <p>So they went along to the fair. Many people were going the same road to the same place,
                  some on horses, some in carts, and even those on foot, most of them, walked faster
                  than the old miller and his little son. These people were very merry; and some of
                  them, as merry people are apt to be, a little impertinent. </p>
               <p>What fools are that old man and his son, said one, to walk on foot, when they have
                  an ass so well able to carry one or the other! </p>
               <p>The miller was very good-natured, and not willing that any body should be displeased
                  with what he did. He was a little afraid before, poor man, whether Charley would be
                  able to hold out. So he took up the little boy in his hand, and set him on the ass;
                  and Charley was not at bottom displeased with the change, though he was a very good
                  boy, and cheerfully walked a-foot, when his father bid him. </p>
               <p>By and by three jolly farmers rode by. They stopped to look at the travellers. Why,
                  you lazy little urchin, said one of them, are not you ashamed to be riding at your
                  ease, while your poor old father trudges by your side?</p>
               <p>This speech made poor Charley feel very uncomfortable. He had always been a dutiful
                  child, and could not bear to have it thought otherwise. He began almost to cry. He
                  slid down from the ass as fast as he could, and said, Pray, pray, father, do you ride,
                  and let me walk. The miller did not like that any body should form an ill opinion
                  of Charley, and consented. </p>
               <p>The next party that came up was three farmers' wives. What a pretty boy! said one
                  of them. A little weakly or so, but that only makes him look more delicate and interesting.
                  I am afraid one of his feet is hurt with walking; look if he does not go a little
                  lame! What a brute of a man must his father be, to jog on at his ease, and make this
                  sweet child limp after him as well as he can! The miller heard, and changed his plan.
                  Come, Charley, said he, we will both ride; I hope ever body will think that right.
                  </p>
               <p>The next man that came meant I believe to play the rogue. He had heard what the others
                  had said, and smiled to see the good-natured pains the miller took to please every
                  body. Pray, friend, said he to the father, is that ass your own? One would think not
                  by the unmerciful way in which you load him. But, I suppose, you expect to kill him
                  by the journey, and to sell his skin at the fair to make pocket-books. </p>
               <p>The miller had tried almost all the schemes he could think of, and had not been able
                  to pass along without being jeered at. At last he thought of one more. He pulled a
                  large stake out of the hedge; he got a rope, and tied the ass's feet, two and two,
                  together, and made them fast to the stake. Now, Charley, said he, as the ass must
                  not carry us, let us try to carry the ass. I confess this was a very silly scheme;
                  but what could the poor miller do? Charley could hardly lift his end of the pole.
                  Ha! ha! ha! Hoh! hoh! hoh! said the people, this is the strangest sight we ever saw.
                  </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>All this passed just by a bridge. Before they had got two steps upon the bridge, the
                     ass was frightened with the noise, and struggled very much; Charley lost his hold;
                     and the ass fell into the water. It was well for the poor creature that they had not
                     got to the middle of the bridge; otherwise, with his legs tied together, he could
                     not have helped himself, and must infallibly have been drowned.

                              does not go so far as to carry the ass.</span></div>

               </div>
               <p>Come, Charley, said the old man, I see what a foolish mistake I have made. We ought
                  to listen to the opinions of such as have a great deal of kindness and a great deal
                  of sense to advise us, but not to the gabble of people who perhaps make their silly
                  remarks only in hopes to vex the passers-by.</p>
               <p>So they went on to the fair in the same manner that they had set out. If people laughed
                  or jeered, the miller took no notice, but quietly kept on his way. Conducting himself
                  thus, he speedily sold his ass; and Charley came home with his father after dinner,
                  beating his drum, and laughing within himself at the people that had laughed at him
                  in the morning. He was however sometimes sorry at heart, when he recollected that
                  he should perhaps never see his dear ass again. </p>

                  friends, as much as the best mouse that wore a head; and he begged and prayed his
                  town-cousin to come some day and take a dinner with him. The town-mouse consented.

                     window-shutters. They sat down to dinner. The host had ranged all the provisions in
                     a hollow tree, that they might be sure not to be disturbed. He placed a nice soft
                     cushion of moss for his guest, and set before him a little piece of bacon, and a morsel
                     of beef that had been boiled for soup, and a bit of cheese, and a golden pippin.

                     polite to his visitor as a mouse could be, and hoped he would be able to make a dinner,
                     and assured him that the cheese was made of the finest cream, and the pippin was fresh
                     gathered. The city-mouse however made a miserable meal; he could not relish such country-fare.
                     After dinner he asked his entertainer very gravely, how he could be content to waste
                     his life in such a wretched hole? Consider, said the town-mouse, you are now young,
                     and should enjoy yourself. You should see men and cities. When once you know the world,
                     you will despise this rustic life as much as I do. The town-mouse gave the country-mouse
                     such an account of what a fine thing it was to go to court, that at last he consented
                     to go back with him to the palace of Macenas on the Esquiline hill.

                  country-mouse was out of his senses to see what a fine home it was. The rooms were
                  almost as large and lofty as a church; the walls were adorned with looking-glasses

                     ever saw. The mice were terribly frightened, and scampered away as fast as they could.
                     But the walls of the marble dining hall were so well fitted, that there was not a
                     chink for so much as a spider to hide himself. It was almost a miracle that the mice
                     escaped, and at last got to a dark, dirty hole in some wainscot, where the town-mouse
                     was accustomed to sleep.</p>

                  </p>
               <p>Not in a minute, said the country-mouse, that I can help! As soon as every thing is
                  once more quiet, I will take my leave of cities and ministers of state for ever. I
                  dare say I shall not recover the fright I have been in for a fortnight. Give me a
                  temperate life and a safe one. I shall thank you, the longest day I have to live,
                  for the lesson you have taught me. I shall go home now, and know, better than ever
                  I did before, the blessings of a hollow tree and a crust of bread. </p>

                     </div> It was all got by the labour of his own hands, and I believe it was some years before
                     he had made it so much. In the village where he lived they had known him from a boy,
                     and a smart, merry boy he was. He was always laughing from morning till night. This
                     was certainly laughing too much; but the boy meant no harm, and every body laughed
                     with him. Poor fellow, he had never learned to read or write; he thought he had no
                     chance to be wise; he had heard something about merry and wise; and, as he could not
                     be wise, he determined to be merry, that he might be sure to be something.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Well, when he was about twenty or thirty years old, the fancy took him, that he would
                  save a penny or two-pence a day, till he had got fifty guineas. If he saved only two-pence
                  a day, he must have been fifteen years about it; but I believe he got some presents,
                  and a little matter that his father and uncle left him when they died, which made
                  him not quite so long. I wonder what he intended to do with his fifty guineas when
                  he had got it? Did he mean to buy a horse? or a pleasure-boat? or a fine gold watch
                  with a gold seal to it? What could he do with fifty guineas? You shall hear: but do
                  not be in a hurry now!</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It was very hard for him always to lay by two-pence out of the wages of his day's
                     work. He never bought any oranges or cherries. When other people went to the fair,
                     he staid at home. When other people got a little bit of meat or of cheese, he had
                     nothing but dry bread for his dinner; and, instead of beer, he drank only water. I
                     assure you, when people work all day ploughing or digging, they ought to drink beer,
                     and some strong beer too.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>I assure you... strong beer too: The distinction here is between "small beer" and
                              "strong beer." Small beer had a very low alcohol content and was drunk instead of
                              water with meals, including breakfast, and by children and servants. Strong beer had
                              a higher alcohol content and more closely resembled what we would today think of beer.
                              Beer's popularity was already being eclipsed by tea by the turn of the nineteenth
                              century, but the hearty beverage still had strong working-class roots: in The Making
                              of the English Working Class (1963), E.P. Thompson notes that "beer was regarded—by

               </div>
               <p>But what people thought the strangest of all was, that this fellow who had been so
                  merry and good-natured a boy, grew very serious, and, what was worse, very ill-tempered
                  too. He hardly ever spoke, and when people asked him a question, he answered them
                  as roughly as possible. The fact was, he was always thinking of his money, and the
                  thought of it would not even let him sleep of nights. Then he was so much troubled
                  what to do with it, and how to keep it safe. When he lived in a house, it was a poor
                  sort of a house, with a door that a man could almost burst open with his foot: and,
                  when he lived in a lodging, he had but one room, and other people sometimes came into
                  the room. So he went to the schoolmaster of the village, and begged the favour of
                  him to take care of it. The schoolmaster was a very good man, and kept it quite safe.
                  But the poor man was not a bit the easier: he thought the schoolmaster might lose
                  it, might have his house robbed, or might die and the people who came after him might
                  not believe that so great a heap of money belonged to so poor a man. As he could neither
                  write nor read, he did not understand much about receipts and promisory notes. </p>
               <p>At last, when he had made it up full fifty guineas, he went to the schoolmaster, and
                  begged he might have it in his own possession. And now we come to see what he did
                  with it. He thought about horses and pleasure boats and watches. But none of these
                  things pleased him. When he got home, he crept into the darkest corner of his room,
                  and began to count his money. He thought fifty guineas in gold looked prettier than
                  all the horses and pleasure-boats in the world. But where should be put them? He thought
                  of twenty people to take care of them, and twenty places to hide them. At last he
                  collected a solitary field a great way from any path, and he determined to bury them
                  there. He went to the field, and walked round the field, and looked in every corner.
                  By and by he spied a large stone which stuck so deep in the ground that nothing but
                  the top of it could be seen. With a good deal of trouble he pulled it up. There was
                  then a deep hollow place. The miser now took out his hedging-knife, and made a round
                  mark in the middle of this place, and shoveled out the mould, till he had got a hole
                  big enough to hold his fifty guineas. He then put down the stone again, and it lay
                  as close and as snug as if it had never been moved. </p>
               <p>It was a good while before he could prevail upon himself to go away. Once or twice
                  he raised the stone gently by one corner, and peeped in: there were the guineas! He
                  had not gone the length of two fields, before he came back. He looked all round to
                  see if there was any body near: he then raised the stone as before: there were the
                  guineas! He came twice again before night, and the last time, he took out his money
                  and counted it. </p>
               <p>Unluckily Wicked Will happened to be all the while at work on the other side of the
                  hedge. Wicked Will was a good-for-nothing, drunken fellow, and had neither truth nor
                  honesty in him. If the miser had come but once, Will would have thought nothing of
                  the matter; but he was surprised to see him come so often. He recollected what a scraping,
                  saving man the miser was, and began to guess the truth. Night was no sooner completely
                  come, than Will went to the spot, took away the money, and walked and ran twenty miles
                  before day-light, that he might never be found. </p>
               <p>The next morning, as soon as it was light, the miser set out again to look at his
                  money. I firmly believe he would never have been able to do a day's work as long as
                  it staid there, he would have wanted to look at it so often. You may think then how
                  sorry he was, when he raised the stone, and found it gone. He cried and screamed,
                  and acted like a madman. He staid there so long, that at last the farmer to whom the
                  field belonged, opened the gate and rode in, to consider whether he should lay the
                  field down for grass, or plough it for corn. He presently saw the miser and his distress.
                  </p>
               <p>What is the matter with you, my good fellow? said the farmer.</p>
               <p>Oh, my money, my money! said the miser. </p>
               <p>What money?</p>
               <p>Oh, my money! my fifty guineas!</p>
               <p>Where are they?</p>
               <p>I buried them yesterday under this stone, and they are gone. </p>
               <p>Buried them! said the farmer, that is a strange way to treat money. Why did not you
                  keep it at home, and then it would have been always ready for use. </p>
               <p>Use! said the miser. I would not have spent a penny of it, to save myself from starving.
                  For all the world I would not have made it a farthing less than fifty guineas. </p>
               <p>Oh, if that is the case, said the farmer, there is a number of pebbles in yon corner;
                  fetch fifty of them, and put them in the hole, and they will do every bit as well
                  as guineas for every thing but use. If you had saved a little against you were sick
                  or lame, I should have thought you a wise man; but if you had determined never to
                  change one of your guineas, take my word for it you have lost nothing at all. </p>
               <p>Now what do you think happened after this poor miser? He never got his money again.
                  For some days he was so sorry, that he could hardly go to work. But by degrees he
                  forgot his loss: and then, I cannot tell how it happened, when he was no richer than
                  his neighbours, he ate better, and whistled better, than when he had fifty guineas
                  that he had resolved never to change. </p>

               <p><span class="smcap">I do</span> not know of my own knowledge that foxes are fond of grapes. But Esop says they are,
                  and that is enough for us.</p>
               <p>A fox once found his way into a very fine garden. I suppose he had missed his road,
                  for the favourite walk of the fox is into the poultry-yard, that he may pick up a
                  chicken or two for his dinner. Here there were a great many fine flowers; but the
                  fox did not care for that. Men are very fond of flowers, and so are bees and other
                  insects; but birds and beasts think nothing about them; you never saw either smell
                  at a rose. There was also a great deal of fine fruit: and, as Esop's fox was fond
                  of grapes, I dare say he was delighted to see the apples and pears and nectarines
                  and peaches. He walked up and down the garden, and was so pleased with every thing,
                  that for the life of him he did not know what to chuse. </p>
               <p>At last he came to a wall that was all covered with the finest grapes you ever saw.
                  They were full of juice almost ready to burst; the purple ones were turned black,
                  and the green were so ripe, that they looked as if you could see through them. I said,
                  the wall was covered with grapes; but that is not quite exact. The ladies and gentlemen
                  had gathered all the clusters that hung within their reach; but higher up the vines
                  were still full. The moment the fox saw them, his choice was fixed: he resolved to
                  make his dinner here without seeking any further. </p>
               <p>The fox is a very little animal, though he is very nimble. His ambition was greater
                  than his strength. He jumped and jumped, you never saw such jumps in your life. First
                  he could not jump high enough; but afterward he mended his jumps, and I believe jumped
                  quite as high as the clusters. But, I do not know how it was, not a single grape he
                  could catch. At last he was quite tired and almost lamed with the efforts he had made.
                  The fox was extremely mortified. He looked up; there hung the grapes, but not one
                  for him! He determined then to carry off his disappointment with a spirit. What a
                  fool have I been! said he. I can see now plain enough that the grapes are sour, and
                  not fit to be eaten. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>From this fable it has come to be a proverb, when a man pretends not to wish for what
                     he cannot have, to say to him, The grapes are sour. If you ask a poor haymaker, whether
                     he would not like that the parsonage-house were his? perhaps he will answer, No, indeed,
                     he likes his mud-cottage as well. The fox was not wrong to endeavour contentedly to
                     go without what he could not get, but he need not have told an un-truth.

               <p>A lion was once sleeping in a forest. A poor little mouse, that thought no harm, was
                  playing about, and in one of his frisks ran against the lion, and awaked him. The
                  lion, angry with being disturbed, and not knowing who had done it, put out his paw,
                  and took up the mouse. The mouse was terribly frightened, and thought he was going
                  to be killed in a moment. The life of a mouse is of quite as much value to him, as
                  the life of a rhinoceros. But, when the lion looked at his victim, he could not find
                  in his heart to hurt such a poor little fellow. He set him down very gently. The mouse
                  scampered away as fast as he could, and was so overjoyed with his escape, that he
                  had not time to say, Thank you! to the king of beasts. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>A few days afterward, as the lion was prancing away, and amusing himself in the forest,
                     he happened unawares to entangle himself in a large net that some sailors had spread,
                     who wanted to catch a lion for king George, to be put into the Tower of London.

                              residence; one of its draws was a menagerie open to the public, in which lions were
                              a star attraction. In the eighteenth century admission to the menagerie cost three
                              half-pence or a cat or dog to be fed to the lions. The last of the animals housed
                              in the Tower of London were relocated to Regents Park in 1835. Information on the
                              Tower of London zoo may be found in Wilfred Blunt, The Ark in the Park: The Zoo in
                              the Nineteenth Century (London: Hamish Hamilton, 1976), 17.</span></div>
                     </div> When he felt his situation, he was full as much frightened as the mouse had been the
                     other day. He struggled, and sprang, and tossed himself about, but all to no manner
                     of purpose; he only made the business worse. He roared with terror, till all the forest
                     rung with the sound.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The poor mouse, who was not far off, heard the noise, and knew the voice of the animal
                  that had treated him so generously. He ran to examine what was the matter, and whether
                  he could give any assistance. He presently saw how it was. A mouse, though so very
                  little, is an extraordinary animal, and can gnaw through brick-walls. He set himself
                  to gnaw the meshes of the net, and he was never tired till he had done his work. In
                  two or three hours he had gnawed through so many threads, that the lion rose up, as
                  free a beast as ever. The lion was inexpressibly astonished at his deliverance and
                  his deliverer; and you may think how glad he was that he had behaved generously, when
                  the mouse offended him, and woke him out of his sleep. </p>

               <p>An old man was sitting by his fireside, while his children were amusing themselves
                  with Christmas games. He did not appear to take any part in their amusements, though
                  he listened to every thing that was going on. Christmas games are more properly the
                  employment of young people than of old ones. At last he lifted up his head and said,
                  One of you, bring me faggot of sticks from the woodhouse! Sam ran away, and fetched
                  it in a moment. What do you want it for, father? said he. I am sure there is a very
                  good fire. </p>
               <p>You have all been telling your puzzles, said the father; now I will tell you one.
                  Which of you can break this bundle of sticks? I can, said Sam; and I can, said Bob.
                  For young people almost always think they can do every thing, before they have tried,
                  or considered how it is to be done. </p>
               <p>Put the bundle down, said the father, and let the youngest try first. William is too
                  young; but I dare say Charles thinks he can manage it. They all tried from the youngest
                  to the eldest. One lifted it up, and clapped it to his knee. Another put it on the
                  ground, and put his knee to it; a third sat upon it; a fourth stamped upon it; a fifth
                  proposed pinching it with the hinge of the door. We cannot do it, father, said they.
                  Then I will, replied the old man.</p>
               <p>Fetch me a knife! Oh, father, said Charles, you asked us to break the bundle of sticks,
                  not to cut it. Be quiet, boy! said the old man. </p>

                     </div> The old man cut this cord. The faggot immediately tumbled to pieces. He then took
                     up the sticks, one by one, and broke them, as easily as you would crack a nut. The
                     boys all laughed till they could not contain themselves. But the old man went on very

                  one of them, look here, my friend! what a fine oyster! Both of them happened to be
                  very fond of oysters; but your oyster-eaters say, an oyster is spoiled, if it is cut;
                  and they had neither of them a knife. What was to be done? I cannot tell what two
                  generous men would have done in such a case, but each of these men loved an oyster
                  better than his friend. They both ran to take up the poor fish; they knocked their
                  heads against each other, and were almost going to fight.</p>
               <p>Come, come, said one, we will not go to blows about an oyster neither! That would
                  be too foolish. The rule is, He that sees a God-send first, he is the man. In that
                  case, said the first, the oyster is mine, for I showed it you. Do not pretend I am
                  near-sighted neither, said the second; I have as good eyes as my neighbour. A long
                  while before you spoke, I saw something lying on the beach, and was almost sure it
                  was an oyster. They could not settle who saw it first. </p>
               <p>They might have drawn lots, or tossed up a halfpenny, to see who should have the oyster.
                  But they were grave gentlemen, and thought that was too childish a way to settle an
                  affair of this importance. </p>
               <p>As they were in the height of their dispute, a droll fellow happened to be coming
                  along the beach, who lived in the same village. We will take Tom Smith to be judge,
                  said one. Agreed, said the other. Tom came up, and they told him the story. </p>
               <p>So you are determined to go to law before me for the oyster?</p>
               <p>We are. </p>
               <p>Silence the court! Who has got an oyster-knife?</p>
               <p>They had neither got a knife. In their great hurry to eat the oyster, they forgot
                  that they could not open it. Tom had got one. </p>
               <p>Now, gentlemen, let me hear the pleadings on both sides: what have you to say for
                  yourselves?</p>
               <p>I spoke first! I saw it first! I have the best right! I have a better! </p>
               <p>Tom opened the oyster. He looked at one of the claimants, and then at the other, and
                  then at the oyster. It was a fine fat fellow as ever you saw. Nothing could be more
                  tempting. Tom put it to his mouth, and swallowed it in a moment. He then with great
                  gravity gave the two disputants each of them a shell. They stared. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>You agreed to go to law for the oyster, said Tom. Did you never hear that people who

                     is worth in expences, and at last get nothing better than an oyster-shell for their

                  my own, and that depended on me for its food, that I did not love, and take a great
                  deal of care of. For this goose I would have inclosed a beautiful field with iron
                  palisades for the goose to walk in, and have made a clear fish-pond in the middle
                  of it for her to swim in. I would have made a nice warm shed for her to sleep in,
                  with a fresh bed of clean straw every day. I would have fed her with the finest barley,
                  and have given her plenty of geese, and ducks, and swans, if she liked it, to keep
                  her company. I could have done no less, for the most profitable friend I had. </p>
               <p>The silly boy I am telling you of did none of these things. I believe he took care
                  that nobody should steal her. She had lived with him several years, and never failed
                  of her egg a day; so that the ungrateful boy did not think himself at all obliged
                  to her for what she brought him, and would have been very much out of temper with
                  her, if she had once missed of her egg. </p>
               <p>Well, this boy, as I was telling you, did not think fifty pounds a day enough, and
                  was very unhappy that he had not got more. He wanted to have every thing at once.
                  With such a quantity of money he was never used to be disappointed; and, when he had
                  spent his fifty pounds in the morning, he was sure to see several things before night,
                  that he wanted to buy, but he was so poor that he could not.</p>
               <p>I am ashamed to tell you what this wicked boy did. I have already mentioned that he
                  did not love his goose at all; and, though she did so much for him, he did not feel
                  thankful to her. Would you believe, that he got a great knife, and he killed her?
                  </p>
               <p>You perverse ill-natured goose! said he, Why then did not you lay me two eggs a day?
                  Why did you always keep me so poor?</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>As she brought him an egg every day, he thought he should find a great many eggs in
                     her belly. There was not one. He found nothing but a little barley in her crop,

               <h2><span class="head">THE BOYS AND THE FROGS.</span></h2>
               <p><span class="smcap">Some</span> school-boys were just come out of school. You cannot think what a noise they made.
                  They seemed to be all talking at once. One snatched off another's hat, and ran away
                  with it. A second jumped over his comrade's back. Some wrestled; some ran, and almost
                  pushed one another down. They were all in high glee.</p>
               <p>They presently came into a field. Some had bats and balls; some had marbles; and a
                  few came to fly their paper-kites. In one corner of the field there was a pond, and
                  by the side of the pond there was a number of frogs that were basking and amusing
                  themselves. Poor harmless frogs! Why should not a frog be happy as well as a boy?</p>
               <p>One inconsiderate boy caught up two or three stones, and began to throw them at the
                  frogs. When one boy does a naughty thing, others are very apt to do the same. I will
                  lay you a halfpenny, said one, that I can hit that large old one. I will hit that
                  little skinny one in a corner, said a second, which is harder to do than yours. </p>
               <p>Esop says, one of the frogs, seeing the cruel mischief that was going to happen, spoke
                  to the boys. I rather think it was one good and humane boy that spoke to the rest.
                  I will tell you however what was said. </p>
               <p>Stop a minute, I beg of you, and consider what you are going to do. If you had one
                  of the frogs in your hand, which I would not advise you to take, because I should
                  be afraid you would hurt him, you would feel how his heart beats. What bright shining
                  eyes he has got! What a vast way he jumps! How nimble he must be! God gave him his
                  eyes, and his legs, and his joints, and his heart, and all his motions. If you threw
                  a stone at me you might hurt me very much. But to throw it at a poor little frog!
                  You might break one of his legs, or two, or dash out his brains. If you killed him,
                  he could never take his pretty jumps any more, but would lay as still as the stone
                  you have in your hand. If you broke his legs, he could not help himself, but would
                  pine a day or two in misery, and then die. When you are laughing, always consider
                  whether the same thing that makes you laugh, makes some other creature cry, or be
                  miserable. None but a brute of a boy, who deserves to have every bone in his skin
                  broken, would knowingly laugh at another's misery. </p>
               <p>These boys were convinced, and all of them agreed that they would never more run the
                  risk of breaking a frog's legs, or knocking out one of his eyes. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>I am sorry to say, that boys are too apt to be cruel. They will sometimes throw stones
                     at the pretty birds as they hop along in the hedge. But what I think is worst of all,
                     is taking away the birds' nests, and thus making a mother miserable for the loss of
                     all her young ones. A bird's nest is her home and all her happiness: what good can
                     it do to you to disturb her? I hope, my dear Charles,

               <p>There is no living creature so small, not even the mites that live in a cheese, as
                  not to be capable of feeling both pleasure and pain. It is a great pity that we cannot
                  live without hurting any thing; but we cannot. The great fish eat the little ones;
                  the great birds and beasts prey upon the small; even the little birds eat worms and
                  flies; and we eat oxen and sheep and calves. When they are dead, we call them beef
                  and mutton and veal, and are glad to forget that they were once alive. </p>

                     thing about him spoiled, because he would not consent that these creatures should
                     be killed. If we did not kill the rats and mice, we should presently be in the situation
                     of the king and queen in the story of Dick Whittington, who, as soon as their diner
                     was set on the table, saw it devoured by these creatures, before they had time to

                              mayor of London and his vermin-killing cat.</span></div>

               <p>I day say you know why it happens that you can scarcely go into a house where you
                  will not find a cat. The reason is because cats are very clever at catching the rats
                  and mice. The greatest praise you can give to a cat, is to say that she is a good
                  mouser. </p>
               <p>There was once an old house that from the cellar to the garret abounded with mice.
                  It had been a good, handsome house once, but now it was so old that nobody lived in
                  it, and it was hired by some one for a store-house. In one part of it he put books,
                  in another part blankets and drapery, and in another sacks full of corn. No part of
                  this store was spared by the mice. They nibbled and tore the books, and gnawed the
                  blankets, for their sport; and they dined every day plentifully on the gentleman's
                  corn. He presently saw that he had better have no store, than have it all spoiled
                  and devoured by the mice. He therefore brought a fine cat, that loved him very much,
                  and that he had taken great care of ever since she was a kitten; and left her to catch
                  the mice. The cat understood her business very well; the mice had no apprehension
                  of an enemy; and an immense number of them were killed. </p>
               <p>Those that were left alive began to perceive their situation, and kept close in their
                  holes, where the cat could not follow them. They wished now that they had let alone
                  the gentleman's books and blankets, and had fed more sparingly on the corn. Perhaps
                  then he would not have brought his cat into the house. They dared not stir, night
                  or day. They thought the cat was always awake. They sleep of a cat is very light,
                  and the smell of a mouse will make her jump up and run at any time. They were almost
                  starved to death. </p>
               <p>At length they got all together in some corner, out of the cat's reach, with the intention
                  to consult what they should do. This meeting was nothing like what their meetings
                  had been before the cat came. Then they had all of them their bellies full, and were
                  merry, and capered and frisked about like mad things. Now every one was hungry and
                  melancholy. Half their numbers were missing; fathers and mothers and children had
                  all fallen a prey to the terrible cat. Some remedy was grievously wanting against
                  the attacks of the furious wild beast. But the wisest mouse among them could not tell
                  what remedy to recommend. </p>
               <p>While the old ones sat mute with doubt and alarm, a pert young mouse said he had thought
                  of an expedient that would exactly do. Perhaps, said he, none of you have considered
                  the case so closely as I have. If you do but recollect, you will find that even a
                  cat can be in only one room of this large house at a time, and that all the difficulty
                  is to know which room that shall happen to be. A mouse has as many legs as a cat;
                  and we could presently get out of her reach, if we did but know when she was coming.
                  But the misfortune is, that she creeps along slily, and is upon us in a minute, when
                  we are thinking nothing of the matter. Now my advice is, that we should get one of
                  those little hollow bells, that children sometimes hang to the neck of a kitten, and
                  fasten it upon this cat, and then I defy her to creep so slowly, but that this bell
                  shall go tingle, tingle, every step she takes.</p>
               <p>All the young mice were in admiration at the wise speech of their play-fellow. They
                  agreed that he was a mouse of genius, and a great benefactor to the whole community
                  of mice. What happy days they should pass, when the bell was once hung about the cat's
                  neck! They should laugh at their old enemy, and might peep out, and then scamper away,
                  before she could catch them. </p>
               <p>As soon as silence was made, the oldest mouse of the company begged to be heard. He
                  said that the speech of his pert young friend was a very wise speech indeed! The expedient
                  he had hit upon was excellent, and it was impossible to make more than one objection
                  to it. That was, who should hang the bell upon the cat's neck? But, as they had the
                  happiness to have one mouse among them of so great wisdom, perhaps they might have
                  another not inferior in courage, who would do the feat that the young gentleman had
                  recommended. </p>
               <p>The young mice saw that the old one was laughing at them, and he that had made the
                  speech, was so ashamed, that he slunk away to his hole. At last I believe they agreed
                  that the best thing they could do, was for all of them to go away, and look out for
                  some other house, that was not guarded by so ferocious a cat. </p>

                  <p>A country-girl was once walking with her pail-full of milk upon her head: I suppose
                     she was a French girl. She was generally as merry as a cricket; you never saw a creature
                     with such life and spirits. She was always chattering, and her chatter was extremely
                     diverting to almost every body that heard it, because she was very good-natured. The
                     only person that sometimes was not diverted with it was her mother, because this merry
                     disposition of the girl continually made her forget something that her mother had
                     told her to do. The mother was a very good, but a very poor woman; with a great deal
                     of care she saved enough in the week to buy them a Sunday's dinner, and with a great
                     deal of hard work she made their little room as clean as a penny to eat it in. The
                     girl very cheerfully helped her mother in all this; she rubbed and scrubbed as well
                     as the best. But then, as I told you, she was so thoughtless; she lost one thing,
                     she broke another, she tore her shift, and forgot to buy capers

                     </div> to the mutton. You will be surprised when I tell you that this faulty girl was as
                     tall as a woman: her mother was quite ashamed of her. You are sometimes thoughtless
                     now; but I am sure you will cure yourself soon, and when you are sixteen or twenty,
                     will be the most considerate creature in the world.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The mother had tried a hundred ways to cure her. Sometimes she scolded the girl, and
                  then the girl cried bitterly, for she could not bear that her mother should be angry
                  with her. Sometimes the mother cried too, and said gently, Now, Phillis, you have
                  broken the dish that should hold our Sunday's dinner: indeed you will ruin me by your
                  carelessness! They had nothing to live upon but the profits of the milk of one pretty
                  cow, which they carried every day and sold at the market-town. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>At last the mother thought that, if she gave the girl something of her own, she would
                     learn to take care of that. So she said, Phillis, if you will be a good girl all this
                     week, you shall have Saturday's pail of milk to yourself, and all that it sells for
                     shall be your own. The girl was very proud of this proposal, and thought it would
                     be so womanly to go to market with something she could call her own; she tried to
                     be very good. One morning she forgot to take off the cream, before she drew the milk
                     from the leads

                              today, with the term now referring to small saucepans, often with a raised lip around

                     her mother forgave her.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Saturday came, and you may now see Phillis with a pail of milk on her head that was
                  all her own. Now, said Phillis to herself, I will be the most careful and thrifty
                  creature that was ever heard of. Every body shall be surprised, and say, Is this our
                  Phillis? You cannot think how rich I will grow! Let me see! This pail of milk will
                  bring me in a matter of five shillings. I will lay out all of my money in eggs. At
                  a penny a piece I shall have sixty eggs. These eggs I will hatch, and they will bring
                  me so many chickens. I do not know whether Phillis had thought of how she was to hatch
                  them. </p>
               <p>It will be very hard, said she, if these sixty eggs will not produce me at least forty
                  chickens. My chickens at only a shilling a piece will fetch me two pounds; and two
                  pounds will buy me a sow. With this sow I shall have a fine litter of pigs, which
                  I shall fat for almost nothing. The money that I shall sell my sow and pigs for, will
                  buy me a cow, and this cow will have a calf. What a pretty calf it will be! I have
                  no doubt it will love me very much, and will come jumping along the field to kiss
                  me every time it sees me.</p>
               <p>Phillis was so pleased with the notion of the pretty calf jumping along the meadow
                  to meet her, and then holding up its sweet mouth for a kiss, that she quite forgot
                  the pail of milk, and could not help jumping herself at the thought. Down came the
                  pail in a moment; the milk ran in twenty streams on the ground, and away swam the
                  eggs, and the chickens, and the sow, and the cow with her pretty calf, that Phillis
                  had been thinking of with so much delight. </p>
               <p>This was a lesson to poor Phillis, that she never forgot; the next time she had a
                  pail of milk to her own share she never offered to jump; but I am not sure that she
                  made quite so large a profit of it, as we have seen her put together in her castle
                  in the air. </p>

                     had not a pain or an ache about him. The farmer pulled off his hat, scraped his foot
                     upon the floor, and stood very humbly at the further end of a long table.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Well, fellow, said that justice, what dost come to me about? </p>
               <p>An please your worship, said the farmer, I have a sad story to tell.</p>
               <p>Hah! you have always sad stories to tell. You little farmers are for ever falling
                  out among yourselves, and then you come and plague me with your quarrels. </p>
               <p>But this is all between me and your worship. I have an unlucky bullock that is for
                  ever breaking out of pasture, and now he has got into your worship's best field of
                  corn, and has spoiled a matter of half an acre. Now I want to know what you would
                  have me do in the case. </p>
               <p>Well, said the justice, I cannot but say that thou art an honest fellow, to come and
                  tell me of it thyself: and, as that is the case, I shall merely send my bailiff to
                  look at the waste, and what he says it comes to, thou must pay. I shall beside expect,
                  as thou saist that thy bullock is an unlucky one, and for ever breaking out of pasture,
                  that thou shalt kill him immediately. </p>
               <p>Bless your honour! said the farmer; what was I saying? I have only two or three harmless
                  cows in the world. No; it is your honour's famous red bull, that frightens all the
                  children, and that neither locks nor bars can confine, that has broken into my corn,
                  and terrible work he has made of it. To be sure I thought I was ruined. But, being
                  as how your worship talks of sending your bailiff to see what the damage comes to,
                  and killing the bull immediately, why I am satisfied, and I humbly thank you. </p>
               <p>The justice was terribly ashamed of himself. If the farmer had said at first that
                  it was the justice's bull that had done all the mischief, I am afraid he would have
                  set a very different face on it. But he thought he could not sit there as a justice,
                  and say that there was one rule for a rich man, and another for a poor one. So he
                  sent his bailiff, and paid the waste, and the poor man was contented with this, and
                  excused his worship from killing the bull.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">THE ASS IN THE LION'S SKIN.</span></h2>
               <p><span class="smcap">An</span> ass is a very useful and a very patient animal; one would have expected therefore
                  that every body would have thought of him with respect. To be sure he is not half
                  so handsome as a horse, and his coat is apt to be ragged; but, poor fellow! he cannot
                  help that. The only noise he is able to make is called braying, and you never heard
                  a noise more contemptible and disagreeable. But the worst of him is that he is very
                  slow and awkward in his motions; whatever you do, my dear child, take care not to
                  be slow and awkward in going about it.</p>
               <p>A poor ass had long been the sport of all the boys in a village; they shouted and
                  hooted after him, and frightened the poor creature very much; they sometimes beat
                  him and threw stones at him; for vulgar and ragged boys are apt to be cruel, they
                  have never been taught any better; then the ass ran and galloped away from them as
                  fast as he could. All this happened in a country where lions live; I suppose in Africa.
                  </p>
               <p>One day this poor ass came to a place when he saw a lion's skin lying on the ground.
                  How I wish I were a lion! thought the ass. Then, instead of these naughty boys frightening
                  me, I should be able to frighten them. Sometimes they have thrown an unlucky stone,
                  which has made me lame for several days; but, if I were a lion, I would not hurt them,
                  I would only terrify them soundly.</p>
               <p>Thinking thus, the ass turned over the lion's skin: it was a very fine one. It would
                  make a nice, warm coat for me, thought the ass: and with no more ado he began to put
                  it on. He rolled himself up very snug in it, and pulled down the skin of the lion's
                  head over his face. He then looked at himself in the river. I am vastly like a lion,
                  thought the ass: I dare say I can make my tormentors think I am one; they are only
                  silly boys. So away he went to try. </p>
               <p>The ass, quite proud of the new appearance he had put on, trotted along toward the
                  village. Presently he came to where some boys were playing at marbles. To be sure
                  the trotting of an ass is not very much like the port of a lion; but the boys were
                  much too frightened to observe that. They thought they should be eaten all up in a
                  moment. They screamed; and, in their hurry to get away tumbled over one another. They
                  then got up and ran; and away trotted the ass after them. </p>
               <p>This succeeded wonderfully well the first day, and the ass was delighted to terrify
                  these naughty boys, who had so richly deserved it. The next day he came again; but
                  he thought the boys did not run so fast as they had done before. He knew that the
                  most alarming thing even in a lion is his tremendous roarings, and he determined to
                  roar too. So he opened his mouth as fiercely as he could; but, alas! instead of a
                  roar, there came out nothing but a bray. It was so loud a bray, that all the fields
                  resounded with it. The boys were astonished. One or two of the boldest stopped, and
                  began to look suspiciously at the pursuer. When any body pretends to be what he is
                  not, if you stop to examine him, it is all over. Aha! Mr. Donkey, said they, is it
                  you all this while? A cheat! A cheat! Cheats are always found out. </p>
               <p>The boys however somehow came to know, that, if the ass had happened to be a lion
                  in reality, he had determined not to hurt a bone in their skin; and they resolved
                  not to teaze him any more. They sometimes rode upon him, when their father wanted
                  any thing from the market-town; but they did not disturb him when he was feeding.
                  And now, instead of running away the moment they came in sight, he would trot to meet
                  them, would rub his head against them to tell them how much he loved them, and would
                  eat the thistles and the oats out of their hand: was not that pretty?</p>

               <p>I do not know that a daw is either handsome or ugly; and indeed we scarcely ever call
                  any one ugly, unless he puts on fantastical airs, and seems to say, Bless me, how
                  handsome I am! A cobbler is thought very good company among cobblers, though perhaps
                  he would not be called so among lords: a daw is very good company among daws, though
                  he would not be admitted into the society of peacocks. There is nobody so ignorant
                  or so plain, but he may find a society of his own, where, if he will be obliging and
                  good-natured, he may be very happy. </p>
               <p>The daw I am going to tell you of, was a good-natured, merry fellow, and the other
                  daws liked him, and thought him clever. But, foolish daw that he was, he was not contented.
                  In one of his flights, he happened to alight in the middle of a <span class="foreign">ménagerie</span> of peacocks. What beautiful birds are these! thought he. Their colours, green and
                  purple and gold, seem almost to outshine the sun. Look at that peacock with his tail
                  spread in a complete circle! I think I never saw so fine a sight. How I wish I were
                  a peacock! I can talk English, and do several things that a peacock cannot do; and
                  I think I should be every bit as fine a bird, if I had but his feathers.</p>
               <p>While the daw was thus muttering to himself, he saw a number of peacock's feathers,
                  scattered on the ground. The thought immediately came into his head that he would
                  try to be as fine as a peacock. Just at this moment the master of the <span class="foreign">ménagerie</span> called his birds into a little inclosure, that he might give them their breakfast.
                  The daw was left alone. He looked again at the feathers on the ground, and suddenly
                  began to snatch them up, and dress himself as well as he could. There was a pond in
                  the middle of the <span class="foreign">ménagerie</span>, that served him for a looking-glass. By the time the peacocks had finished their
                  breakfast, he thought himself as fine as the best of them.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>They came back, and he began to strut away, and show his gold-faced clothes. The peacocks
                     did not at first know what to make of it; they thought him an odd sort of bird. What's
                     o'clock? said the daw. They were then very sure he was not a peacock. A peacock has
                     a graceful winding motion with his neck, by which he shows off his beautiful colours,
                     that are even handsomer than those of his tail. The daw tried to do that; you cannot
                     think what a hand he made of it. It would be just the same, if a ploughman dressed
                     himself up like a lord. The moment he said, What's o'clock? every body would perceive
                     that he was not a nobleman; and, when he began to make his <span class="foreign">congées</span>,

               </div>
               <p>The peacocks, when they saw what was the case, began to be very angry. They resolved
                  to punish the daw severely for his impudence and intrusion. Accordingly, they not
                  only plucked from him, as completely as they could, the borrowed feathers, which he
                  had no right to, but gave him a very hard beating with their beaks. They then hooted
                  and squalled him out of their company. </p>
               <p>The daw, heartily ashamed of his misfortune, flew back to his brother-daws, determined
                  not to discover to any body what had happened. But unluckily a few feathers of the
                  peacocks still stuck about him, and his companions, knowing what a coxcomb he was,
                  soon guessed the whole. They used him as ill as the peacocks had done, and resolved
                  that a daw, who was ashamed of what nature and fortune had made him, should be no
                  companion for them. They did not forgive him, till he showed strong tokens of repentance,
                  and that he was determined never again to be proud, of what he ought to take off every
                  night when he went to bed. </p>

               <h2><span class="head">THE DOG AND THE SHADOW.</span></h2>
               <p><span class="smcap">There</span> was once a very snarling, ill-natured dog, that nobody would suffer to live in his
                  house. When he had a master, he would snap at and bite the children of the family,
                  though they did not teaze him at all, and would do a hundred other naughty tricks.
                  Several masters tried him, but all grew tired, and one after another turned him out
                  of doors. The poor dog now had nothing to eat, and was almost starved.</p>
               <p>A gentleman who saw him in this condition, when he seemed scarcely able to drag one
                  leg after another, took pity upon him. He knew what a naughty dog he had been; but
                  he did not think that even naughty folks should be quite starved to death. He therefore
                  threw him a pretty large piece of flank of beef. The dog instead of seeming thankful
                  to the gentleman, looked very fiercely at him, growled extremely, and then snatched
                  up the meat. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Any other dog, that had been so hungry, would have begun to satisfy his appetite immediately:
                     but this cur, like the dog in the manger you have read of,

                     </div> was always more eager to spoil other people's pleasures, than to enjoy his own. He
                     was afraid that any dog should catch a bit of his prize. He limped away with it, and,
                     though very weak, went further than the gentleman thought had been possible. Every
                     two or three yards he looked round to see whether any dog was following him; but there
                     was no one near.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Presently he came to a river, with a little foot-bridge over it. The dog got on the
                  bridge. As he was going along, he happened to look into the water, and saw his own
                  shadow, with the piece of meat in his mouth. He had been thinking of nothing but the
                  fear of other dogs getting a bit of his beef, and he immediately believed that what
                  he saw was another dog with another piece of meat. His ill-temper would not give him
                  time to consider that what he looked at was water, and that there could not be a dog
                  at the bottom of the water, holding his face up to the sky. I will be hanged, said
                  he to himself, if that dog has not got a larger piece of meat than I have. And no
                  sooner did he persuade himself of that, than he opened his mouth to snap at the piece
                  he saw. His own piece sunk to the bottom of the river. There was the other dog still,
                  but with no piece of meat in his mouth, and looking as surly and discontented as he
                  did. </p>
               <p>I do not know whether this dog ever became very good; but he certainly remembered
                  a long while that ill-nature is not the best means of gaining even what the ill-natured
                  person has in view. The next time the kind-hearted gentleman gave him a piece of flank
                  of beef, he took it a little more thankfully, and ate it upon the spot, without thinking
                  it necessary to run away with it into a forest. </p>

               <h2><span class="head">THE WOLF AND THE MASTIFF.</span></h2>
               <p><span class="smcap">A wolf</span> is a beast of prey; and beasts of prey, like savage men in the woods, must endure
                  to be very hungry and half-starved, when they happen not to meet with creatures fit
                  for them to eat. Yet savages and beasts of prey have their pleasures; they are stronger,
                  and more dextrous in their motions, than the civilized and the tame.</p>
               <p>A lean and hungry wolf happened to take his way near a village, when suddenly, on
                  turning a corner of the road, he met a plump, well-fed mastiff. The two animals looked
                  a little fiercely at each other at first, but the wolf suspected that the dog was
                  stronger than he, and the dog did not perceive that the wolf was about any harm. So
                  they fell into a little familiar chat. </p>
               <p>Said the wolf to the dog, We are animals originally of the same class, only with a
                  little difference in our education. </p>

               <p>Then why, pray, answered the wolf, should we ever quarrel with each other? And so
                  saying, they jogged along the road together. </p>
               <p>Said the wolf to the dog, How fat and sleek you are! You really do credit to your
                  diet. </p>
               <p>The simple dog replied, I am sorry I cannot return the compliment.</p>
               <p>How do you contrive it? asked the wolf. </p>
               <p>I live, said the dog, with an honest farmer, who takes great care of me. </p>
               <p>Aha! answered the wolf, do not you think your farmer would take care of me too?</p>
               <p>I dare say he might, said the dog, as you say you are the same sort of creature that
                  I am. </p>
               <p>And what do you do for your living?</p>
               <p>Nothing but what is very easy. I bark, to frighten away idle people and thieves; I
                  fawn upon my master, and behave civilly to all the family. </p>
               <p>I have no objection to all that, said the wolf; so, if you will introduce me to the
                  farmer, and convince him how willing a servant he shall find me, you and I will be
                  comrades for the rest of our lives. </p>
               <p>Agreed! replied the dog. </p>
               <p>Saying this, they trotted along together, and were now got more than half-way to the
                  farmer's house, when the wolf happening to take another look at his new friend, said,
                  Cousin, what is the matter with your neck? The hair seems to be worn away quite in
                  a circle. </p>
               <p>The mastiff hung his head. He knew what a free and high-spirited creature a wolf is,
                  and he wished to change the conversation. No great matter, said the mastiff: nothing
                  at all. </p>
               <p>Nay, replied the wolf, we are talking now upon friendly terms, and I must intreat
                  you to conceal nothing from me. </p>
               <p>Why, said the dog, I dare say it is nothing but the mark of the collar which my master
                  puts round my neck when he chains me up. </p>
               <p>Chains you up! </p>
               <p>Yes, he generally chains me up in the day time, that I may be more fierce of nights.
                  Sometimes I am so foolish as to be tired of my chain; and then I struggle to get loose,
                  and howl most dismally; and then my master comes with a great club, and gives me a
                  sound beating to make me quiet. But he gives me excellent meat every day, and as much
                  as I can eat. </p>
               <p>Good morning, cousin! said the wolf: I have no wish to be introduced to your kind
                  master, the farmer. It is true I am sometimes very hungry, as I happen to be just
                  now. But hunger shall never make me so slavish and base, as to prefer chains and blows
                  with a belly-full, to my liberty. </p>

               <p>One of Esop's wolves however, that I am now going to tell you about, was of a humour
                  to talk to his prey, and never to play the tyrant, without producing an argument to
                  prove that it was reasonable to do so. This wolf happened to be thirsty, and went
                  to the stream to drink. A little lower down the stream there was a pretty lamb, that,
                  like little Red-Riding-Hood in the story-book, did not know it was dangerous to stay
                  and hear a wolf talk, that was drinking at the same time. </p>
               <p>The wolf looked very fiercely at the lamb, and longed to eat him up. You little knave,
                  said the wolf, how dare you put in your nose there, and make the water all muddy that
                  comes to me to drink! </p>
               <p>I cannot muddy the water for you, replied the lamb, for, look you! I am lower down
                  the stream, and the water comes from you to me. </p>
               <p>Now I think of it, sir, said the wolf, what a pretty character that was you gave of
                  me six months ago! How dared you say that I was a fierce animal, and fond of mutton?
                  Now you shall suffer for your impertinence. </p>
               <p>Indeed, answered the lamb, it could not be I; for six months ago I was not born. </p>
               <p>If it was not you, it was your brother. </p>
               <p>Upon my honour, I never had a brother. </p>
               <p>A pretty fellow you are, said the wolf, to stand contradicting me thus! Know, that
                  nobody shall say the opposite of what I say, but he shall die for his presumption.
                  </p>
               <p>The wolf then, almost beside himself with anger, flew at the lamb; and, if the shepherd
                  to whom the lamb belonged had not come up at the instant, and sent the wolf growling
                  away, the poor little creature would not have had another minute to live. So it is
                  in this world, according to the proverb, that might sometimes overcomes right. </p>

               <p>Your inclination, replied the old mouse, is very commendable. Young people should
                  learn to take care of themselves, and not always want a nurse or a servant at their
                  elbow. But you are so inexperienced and so ignorant, I shall have a thousand fears
                  about you. The carts may run over you, or the horses may trample you to death. Mice
                  have so many enemies in the world! </p>
               <p>Oh, never be afraid for me, mamma! said the young one. You shall see that I will be
                  as quick as a hawk to discover danger, and shall always be wise enough to distinguish
                  a friend from a foe. </p>
               <p>Notwithstanding all that the young mouse said, his mamma could not help feeling a
                  thousand terrors for her darling. Good bye, mamma! said the little one; you may depend
                  upon seeing me in two hours at furthest. Good bye, my love! said the mother. Remember
                  all I have said to you! take care of yourself! </p>
               <p>In less than half an hour the young mouse came running back, out of breath, and all
                  the bristles of her back standing upright with terror. </p>
               <p>What is the matter, my dear? said her mamma. I am so glad to see you again. </p>
               <p>Give me a minute to take breath, and I will tell you. </p>
               <p>I am afraid you have been running heedlessly into some danger, said the old mouse,
                  shaking her head. </p>
               <p>Indeed but I have not, mamma! When you have heard all I have to say, you will think
                  I have acted like a wise young mouse as I am. </p>
               <p>After having gone through two or three fields, and looked at the daisies and butter-cups,
                  and the cows and the ditches, I turned into John Stump's farm-yard hard by. There
                  I examined the hogs and the dogs and the logs, and the ploughs and the rakes, that
                  I might gain experience and know something of the world. </p>
               <p>While I was thus engaged I spied a terrible creature on a dunghill, whom I presently
                  knew for an enemy. I cannot tell the name of this creature; but, if I describe it
                  to you, perhaps you can. It had got a strange piece of flesh, as red as blood, growing
                  on the top of its head, and another, of the same colour, growing under its chin. It
                  flapped its immensely large wings, that seemed to me like the sails of a wind-mill,
                  and then it opened its mouth so wide, that I thought it would eat me up in a moment.
                  Presently came out of its mouth a scream so loud and shrill, that it made every bone
                  in my skin tremble, and I scampered away as fast as I could, and here I am safe. </p>
               <p>It was unlucky that this should have happened just as it did, for at that very moment
                  I saw another creature, in a part of the farm-yard not far from me, that I fell in
                  love with at first sight. This creature was in shape not unlike a mouse, but six or
                  seven times as big. It had a coat soft like ours, but beautifully brindled, black
                  and grey. But what I particularly remarked was that, whereas the gentleman with the
                  blood-coloured crest looked so savage and terrible, this gentle animal had the softest
                  and modestest way of looking I ever beheld. The creature fixed its eyes upon me, and
                  I believe was going to speak to me. But just then Mr. Redcrest set up his terrible
                  squall, and I was obliged to take to my heels.</p>
               <p>My dear child, said the old mouse, every word you speak alarms me more than the word
                  before. The animal with the blood-coloured crest that you ran away from, is a cock,
                  and is one of the most harmless and good-tempered creatures in the world. The other
                  animal that took your fancy so much, and that you fell in love with at first sight,
                  is a cat, an implacable enemy to the whole generation of mice, and that will sometimes
                  murder twenty of us in a morning. If she had come one step nearer to you, I should
                  never, never have seen my darling again. From this you may see how very necessary
                  a thing experience is, how much young people should mistrust their own judgments,
                  and how foolish a creature he is who yields an implicit confidence to appearances.
                  </p>
               <p>The young mouse, after this lesson, grew much more attentive to what her mamma said,
                  and her mamma in consequence loved her more tenderly than ever. </p>

               <h2><span class="head">THE FLY IN THE MAIL COACH.</span></h2>
               <p><span class="smcap">A mail-coach</span> one hot summer's day was travelling along a very dusty road. There were several passengers
                  all in a great hurry to get to their journey's end, and the coach drove very fast.
                  There was a clergyman going to preach his probation sermon the next day: there was
                  a lawyer hastening to settle who had the best right to a great estate: and there was
                  a young couple in a hurry to be married. Beside this, there was a bag of letters,
                  some on very urgent business, and some inclosing bank-notes to a considerable amount.
                  So that, you see, what this coach carried was all together of some importance.</p>
               <p>In the coach among the passengers was a fly. Nobody observed this fly; he sometimes
                  sat upon a gentleman's hat, and sometimes upon a lady's handkerchief, and sometimes
                  in the shade upon the lining of the coach. But the fly was in his own judgment of
                  more importance than all the rest; indeed he had so high a conceit of himself, that
                  he absolutely forgot there was any body else in the coach. He thought it a very nice
                  thing to travel so fast without feeling fatigued, and he was in as great a hurry to
                  get to London, which he had never seen, as any of the human passengers. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It happened as they drove along at a great rate, that a large school of little gentlemen
                     and ladies was walking along the causeway. It was a holiday; they had all been very
                     good; they were dressed in their best clothes; and their school-mistress was taking
                     them to a nice dairy-house, to treat them with syllabub
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note67" id="Note67_return"><sup class="super">

                              Typically, the syllabub is flavored with wine and sugar and then whipped just long
                              enough to form high peaks.</span></div>
                     </div> and cheese-cakes. As the coach drove by, the wind set full in their faces, and the
                     poor children were almost blinded with the dust. The fly looked on very attentively
                     at all that was passing.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Upon my word, said the fly, I am very sorry for those children. I am quite grieved
                  that I should incommode them thus. If I had not been so extremely in a hurry, I would
                  really have desired the coachman to stop, till they were past. But a person of my
                  consequence cannot pass through the world, however excellent his intentions may be,
                  without frequently occasioning inconvenience to his inferiors. </p>

                     any thing about you? I dared not come into the coach, till I saw that there were no
                     children in it, because nature has thought proper to adorn me with brilliant colours,
                     which often bring on my ruin from naughty boys and girls who do not recollect that

                              aimed at children. Mary Wollstonecraft's Original Stories, for example, opens with
                              moral exemplar Mrs Mason explaining to her insect-destroying charges that "the Father
                              of all creatures" made "those snails you despise, and caterpillars, and spiders; and

               <h2><span class="head">THE BELLY AND THE MEMBERS.</span></h2>
               <p><span class="smcap">The</span> fables of the belly and the members was invented by an old Roman, who lived two thousand
                  three hundred years ago. Latium, of which Rome was the capital, was then a country
                  of barbarians, who had no better way of marking the beginning of a new year than by
                  driving a great nail into the church-door, which the chief magistrate did in great
                  ceremony, attended by all his officers. The fable of this grey-bearded savage, who
                  could neither read nor write, is very unlike most other fables, but it is very entertaining,
                  and has a great deal of good sense in it; and therefore I will tell it to you.</p>
               <p>Once upon a time the members of the human body fell out with the belly, and declared
                  they would no longer have any correspondence with her. They complained that she set
                  them all to work, and never did any thing herself: the legs would no longer walk to
                  fetch her meat, the eyes refused to look for it, the hands to lift it to the mouth,
                  the tongue to taste, and the teeth to chew it. By this general conspiracy, said they,
                  we shall speedily bring her to reason, and teach her of how much importance we are,
                  and how useless she. </p>
               <p>The belly was in a pitiful taking; all her servants refused to do any thing for her;
                  and she was quite unable to help herself. She became lank and shrivelled, and her
                  ribs almost forced their way through the skin. Now you will think the members triumphed.
                  </p>
               <p>The belly is not so unimportant a part of the human figure as the members supposed.
                  She foresaw very well how this conspiracy would end; she watched her time; she sat
                  still, and said nothing. </p>
               <p>The members were surprised, when they saw that they all suffered in the misfortunes
                  of the belly. They grew lean and feeble, as she grew so. The legs at first refused
                  to walk; they were now unable to do it; they tottered, and could not keep themselves
                  in a firm and steady position. The fingers had grown cold and stiff; the eyes were
                  glazed and could not distinguish objects; the tongue could not speak, and the jaws
                  were almost locked. All was now tame, and they were willing to hear reason even from
                  the belly that they had despised. </p>
               <p>What fools you were, said she, to think you could go on without my aid! Learn henceforth
                  that it is not always that which makes the greatest show that is of the most real
                  use. Scavengers and shoeblacks have their value in a great city, and ought not to
                  be reviled. My office is ignoble, and I do not pretend to vie with the more glorious
                  members of the body; yet without my services the tongue cannot utter that eloquence
                  which has converted senates, the hands cannot rescue the miserable from destruction,
                  nor the head invent those sciences and arts which raise the human, so far above the
                  brute creation. You thought I did nothing, but you were mistaken. Within my quiet
                  house, where every thing seems so still, goes on the great operation of digestion,
                  by means of which the food that is put into the mouth, is turned to animal substance,
                  and is then conveyed to the different members to maintain them all in health and activity.
                  Come, my friends, let us return to the agreement and kindness in which we have been
                  accustomed to live. It is not yet too late. Feet, you can yet creep a little way,
                  far enough to find some food: hands, you are not so weak but you can grasp it, and
                  carry it to the mouth: teeth, you must resume your office, to chew it well; otherwise
                  it will stick fast in the throat, feeble as the power of swallowing now is, and death
                  will be the consequence. </p>
               <p>The members listened to the prudent advice of the belly. They took a slender and a
                  sparing meal, and were refreshed; the next time less caution was necessary. In a few
                  days the health of the whole was restored, and all the members were as vigorous as
                  ever; and they never after forgot the useful lesson which dire necessity had thus
                  taught them. </p>

               <h2><span class="head">THE SUN AND THE WIND.</span></h2>
               <p><span class="smcap">The</span> sun and the wind once had a dispute which of the two was the most powerful.</p>
               <p>The wind, said, Do you pretend to compare with me? Do not I tear up the tallest trees
                  by the roots? Do not I level palaces and towers in the dust? Do not I raise the ocean
                  into combustion, swell the billows to the size of mountains, and send whole fleets
                  of ships, with all their crews, to a watry grave?</p>
               <p>I grant, replied the sun, these are formidable powers; but they do not equal mine.
                  I open the buds and the flowers, to make glad the heart of man. I cause the grass
                  to grow. Every thing that you see through the whole world, that possesses either vegetable
                  or animal life, owes its health and prosperity to me: were my life-giving influence
                  withdrawn, they would all perish. </p>
               <p>As the disputants were in the height of their argument, a traveller happened to pass
                  along, with a large cloak wrapped about his shoulders. His path lay across a vast
                  plain, where there was neither house nor tree that could shelter him from the inclemencies
                  of the weather. The sun and the wind both agreed to settle their dispute by a trial
                  on this traveller, which of them could first make him part with his cloak. </p>
               <p>The wind began with a terrible puff, that tore away the traveller's cloak from one
                  of his arms, and was near carrying it a mile from him upon the plain. He however recovered
                  his hold, and drew it closely round him. The heavens were now entirely darkened with
                  clouds. The day was turned into night. The wind raved so, that, if the traveller had
                  had a companion instead of being alone, they could not have heard one another speak.
                  He could scarcely keep his feet, or get forward one step; and he almost thought that
                  he must lie down upon the ground, to preserve himself from the violence of the storm.
                  The wind besides called to his assistance the rain, the hail, and the thunder: I do
                  not know whether that was quite fair. The traveller had a terrible time of it: but,
                  for all that the wind could do, he only hugged his cloak the closer about him. </p>
               <p>It was now the sun's turn to try. He burst out with his refulgent rays, and the clouds
                  were scattered in a moment. Every thing was refreshed. The flowers seemed to smile;
                  the beasts returned to their pasture; and the soft droppings from a few scattered
                  bushes were inexpressibly agreeable. The drops glittered in the sunshine. As the sun
                  however was determined to do his utmost, he made his beams hotter and hotter; till
                  the traveller, who was at first exhilarated with his brightness, began to pant and
                  sweat with the sultriness of the season. He loosed some of his buttons to relieve
                  himself, and threw his cloak wide open. At last however he could bear it no longer;
                  he cast it from him upon the ground; he sat down upon it, to try to cool himself;
                  and the sun was decisively the victor in the strife. </p>
               <p>Learn from this, said the sun to his blustering competitor, that soft and gentle means
                  will often accomplish what force and fury may in vain try to effect. </p>
               <p>From this time the sun was always admitted to precedence over the wind, and Apollo,
                  the charioteer of this great luminary, ranked among the Heathen Gods far before Eolus,
                  the ruler of the tempests. </p>

                  that he could do any thing he had a mind to do. I do not much dislike your notion,
                  said his mother, if you would put more consideration and sobriety into your way of
                  thinking about it. Ambition and industry, when directed to a good end, are excellent
                  qualities, and will effect wonders. Yet all power has its limits. Man is perhaps a
                  still more extraordinary creature than a frog; let us see what he can do! With ambition
                  and industry perhaps almost every man may make himself a good farmer, a good sailor,
                  a good soldier, a good surgeon, and excel in almost any employment or pursuit; but
                  I question whether he can climb to the moon, or carry away the north-star in his waistcoat-pocket.
                  And in the foolish way in which you set about it, my child, without persevering ambition
                  or industry, and only saying off-hand, I will do it, he can achieve nothing that is
                  worth doing.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The foolish young frog did not heed what his mother said, but went on in his empty,
                     bragging manner. I question whether, if he had heard Viotti

                              was acting manager of Italian opera at the King's Theatre from 1794 to 1795 and a
                              feature of London's bon ton society in the 1790s until he was suspected of being a
                              Jacobin sympathizer and expelled from England; he eventually returned and became an

                     out of the strings in a minute as miraculous music as you do. What I am going to tell
                     you of him was quite as silly as this.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The young frog and his mamma were once basking in the shade on a beautiful summer's
                  day. Near them in the same field a remarkably fine ox was feeding upon the grass.
                  </p>
               <p>What an admirable creature that is! said the mother. </p>
               <p>Do you think he is as handsome as I am? answered the young frog. </p>
               <p>Handsomer, said the mother. Not to mention his beautiful dappled marks of reddish
                  brown and snowy white, and the sleekness of his skin, so expressive of health and
                  vigour, there is something in size itself, when united with exquisite colours and
                  forms, which affords great delight to the beholder. Size is expressive of power; this
                  ox looks like the monarch of the plains; yet there is something so gentle and sweet
                  in his temper, that one reverences without fearing him. </p>
               <p>Oh, as for that, said the young frog, I will show you that I can be as big as an ox
                  in a minute. </p>
               <p>Consider, my dear child, said the mother, what you are doing! Recollect what I have
                  so often said to you!</p>
               <p>I do not remember at this moment what you mean, answered the young frog. But I will
                  ask you all about it to-morrow. </p>
               <p>So saying, he began to hold his breath, and puff himself up as much as he could. The
                  skin of the frog is very wrinkled, and he really enlarged himself to almost twice
                  his natural size. </p>
               <p>He could not speak, without letting out his breath, and sinking to his natural figure.
                  </p>
               <p>Was not I then as big as the ox? said he.</p>
               <p>Not the hundredth part of his size, answered the mother.</p>
               <p>He tried again, and held his breath so long that I really believe he was a quarter
                  of an inch bigger round than the first time. </p>
               <p>What do you think of that, mamma? said he. </p>
               <p>Not the fiftieth part, replied the mother. </p>
               <p>I will try again. You accused me just now of wanting perseverance. </p>
               <p>In the midst of his third trial, the ox was looking for some fresh grass, and, not
                  observing so diminutive an animal, had like to have trod him to death with one of
                  his hoofs. The young frog, thoroughly frightened, let go his breath, and scampered
                  away in a trice; and I believe he never after talked of making himself as big as an
                  ox. </p>

               <h2><span class="head">THE HORSE AND THE STAG.</span></h2>
               <p><span class="smcap">The</span> horse was once a free and a noble creature, and galloped about the forests just as
                  his fancy prompted him, without carrying another creature upon his back. In days of
                  yore, when man lived upon acorns and roots, and had neither coach-house nor stable
                  belonging to him, the horse was equally unacquainted with the saddle, the bridle,
                  the whip, and the spur.</p>
               <p>In these happy times (happy for the poor horses), when they had nothing to do, but
                  to prance along the plains, and neigh to their gamesome mates, a horse once got into
                  a quarrel with a stag. It began in play, as the quarrels of children are apt to do;
                  the horse tossed his head wantonly to the stag, and the stag did the same in return.
                  But the stag had horns, and the horse had none; so the stag, without thinking any
                  harm, gored the horse in his beautiful neck, and the blood began to gush out in a
                  stream. The horse did not like to see his blood trickle upon the ground, and the wound
                  smarted a good deal. The good-natured stag was very sorry, but the horse did not care;
                  he declared that one way or other he would be even with him. </p>
               <p>The horse was a long while considering how he should accomplish his revenge. His perplexity
                  was not, as I have read in some book, that he could not overtake the stag; for I doubt
                  whether his taking a man upon his back, which was the scheme he thought of, would
                  at all have increased his power of doing that. But he was no way superior to the stag
                  he quarrelled with in weapons of offence, and his want of horns made him sure that
                  he should be the loser in a battle. </p>
               <p>At last, as I was saying, the horse applied to man for his assistance. I know, observed
                  the horse, that there is no food that pleases the human palate so much as venison;
                  but you can but seldom get it. Your feet cannot run so fast as the deer; mine can;
                  but that is all I can do. When I have overtaken him, he only turns about and tosses
                  his head at me. I know a stag that I am sure would be the finest eating in the world,
                  and he has given me an affront. Perhaps we could find a plan, by joining my swiftness
                  and your skill together, of humbling this proud fellow in the dust. </p>
               <p>I can easily tell how that may be done, said the man, provided you will listen to
                  me, and do as I would have you. The horse consented; and the man, having put a bridle
                  upon him, with a bit in his mouth, leaped upon his back, and rode away in search of
                  the stag. They presently found him. </p>
               <p>It was now quite a different affair for the poor stag, from what it had been when
                  the horse and he played together in the forest. Several of the stag's relations had
                  been gored by the spear of the man already, when the hunters lay in wait for them,
                  concealed behind a tree or a hedge; their dependence then, if they were not taken
                  by surprise, was upon the superior swiftness of their feet; but now that the poor
                  stag saw the hunter mounted upon the back of the horse, and the terrible spear ready
                  grasped in his hand, his heart sunk within him. What he could however he did; he ran
                  for his life. He ran for hours. At last, panting, gasping, his legs no longer able
                  to support him, he fell at his length on the ground. The man came up, and the spear
                  pierced the stag to his heart. </p>
               <p>The wicked, cruel horse, when he saw his enemy dead at his feet, neighed for joy.
                  Was not this a barbarous revenge, because the stag had merely razed the skin of the
                  horse's neck? I wonder what happened to the horse afterward. Something terrible, you
                  may be sure. </p>
               <p>The horse thanked the man for having so well assisted his desires. Now, thought he,
                  I shall reign unrivalled lord of the forest; no creature will henceforth dare to insult
                  me. I shall remember your kindness, said he to the man, when I shall no longer have
                  the pleasure of seeing you. </p>
               <p>Fair and softly, replied the hunter, you and I do not part so. Having been once upon
                  your back, I find that you will be a very useful beast to me. I have a pretty hovel,
                  and you shall live in one room of it. I shall be able every holiday to treat myself
                  with a pleasant ride; and every working day you shall plough my field or draw my cart.
                  The horse had no remedy; the man, having once been his master, was always his master;
                  and a hundred and a hundred times, when the horse came in weary from a sharp day's
                  work, he had occasion to reflect, that vengeance, too eagerly pursued, always brings
                  the revengeful party to misery. </p>

                  numbed with the cold, he could not bear to think of leaving this poor creature behind
                  him in so miserable a condition. He turned it over; it was quite stiff, and its eyes
                  were shut; he began to believe that it was dead. Once however that he touched it,
                  he perceived that it moved. He unbuttoned his coat, and put it in his bosom, that
                  it might get warm there. I am afraid, if the adder had fully recovered in that place,
                  it would perhaps have stung its benefactor to the heart. </p>
               <p>When the poor man got home, he took out the adder, and saw that it was a little better;
                  it half opened its sparkling eyes. He laid it on the hearth, and told his children
                  what he had done; they gathered round, and admired the beautiful colours of the creature.
                  As the fire sparkled and blazed, the adder got stronger and stronger. For a considerable
                  time however it lay perfectly still; when, on a sudden, it started up in full strength,
                  reared its beautiful head, flew about the kitchen from one end to the other, and hissed
                  most terribly. The children screamed and shrieked; the bigger ones leaped upon the
                  tables and chairs; and at last the venomous beast seemed to dart at one of them, and
                  in a moment longer would have stung it to death. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The poor man was so terrified that he did not know what to do; but a neighbour who
                     passed by, heard the noise, and, knowing that this was the house of the good-natured
                     man, opened the door in haste, and with a bill-hook

                     a fit return for the creature who behaved so ill to the poor man that had saved his
                     life. The neighbour did not care for the danger to himself, when he saw how much mischief
                     hung over the family of the good-natured man.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The good-natured man learned a wise lesson from this adventure: he saw how much mischief
                  he had nearly brought upon himself by a kindness that paid no attention to the different
                  qualities of living creatures; but then he saw that the life of his child had been
                  saved by a person, to whom he had once acted generously, without acting imprudently.
                  </p>
               <p>The only thing that puzzles me in this story is the behaviour of the adder. It is
                  contrary to the nature of all animals; for I have found it almost an universal rule,
                  that no creature will harm you, if you have not first done that creature harm. </p>

               <h2><span class="head">THE BEAR AND THE BEES.</span></h2>
               <p><span class="smcap">A tame</span> bear, as he was once walking in his master's farm-yard, happened to be stung by a
                  bee: I dare say the bear had done some hurt to the bee, though he was not aware of
                  it; but the bee thought it was on purpose, and treated the offender accordingly.</p>
               <p>The sting of a bee is extremely painful for an hour or two; it inflames the flesh
                  very much; but the next day you are as well as if nothing had happened. The bear felt
                  the smart, and was very angry that so little a creature as a bee, had dared to treat
                  an animal of his importance so unceremoniously. He resolved on revenge, and determined
                  to punish the whole community of bees, for the injury which had been done him by one
                  of their species. He went accordingly to the hive the bee had flown out from, and
                  with his snout pushed it from the shelf upon which it stood, and overturned it upon
                  the ground. There, said he, take that! and beware another time how you behave impertinently
                  to a bear! </p>
               <p>The bees were exceedingly enraged. Their combs are formed in the nicest order, of
                  wax; every one of the cells has exactly six sides; and the whole together is like
                  a great city. Here was the whole city of these poor bees overturned in a moment by
                  the unreasonable vengeance of this stupid bear. More than a hundred bees flew out
                  at once; they all fixed upon the bear, and stung him in every part of his body and
                  head. If you had been served so, though the sting of one bee does no lasting harm,
                  I believe all together it would have killed you. The bear was several days in exquisite
                  pain, and as hot as fire; and had time enough to reflect how foolish, as well as wicked,
                  it is, in return for one trifling injury, to put ourselves in a great passion, and
                  do all the harm we can. </p>
               <p>The farmer's son came, and put the hive upon the shelf again, which the bees could
                  never have done themselves. They were however a long while before they had repaired
                  all the disorder the bear had committed, and some of their young ones were crushed
                  to death. </p>

                     where horses are used to be kept, that a great deal of rain having fallen, one of
                     these balls was set a swimming along the kennel,

                     the cows to drink at. Over this pond certain apple-trees, golden pippins and others,
                     of a smooth and glossy rind, or a beautiful blush, extended their well-stored branches.
                     Several apples, either from their ripeness, or being shaken down by the wind, had
                     fallen into the water, and were floating on the top of the pond. I once had a little
                     brother, two years old, who, having wandered by himself to the edge of such a pond,
                     and not knowing that water would drown him, was so attracted by the beautiful appearance
                     of the floating apples that he went forward to take them, fell into the water, and
                     was killed.</p>

               <p>The horse-dung I was mentioning, was quite intoxicated with his situation, as he swam
                  this way and that upon the surface of the pond. He had never been in such good company
                  in his life. There was not a thing of any sort floating within the whole circumference
                  of the pond, that was not an apple, but himself. He quite forgot his origin and nature.
                  In the pride of his heart he could not help crying out as he glided along, See how
                  we apples swim! </p>
               <p>This is but a short fable; but it is intended to show that, if any one, favoured by
                  fortune, or admitted into the society of those who are wiser or better than himself,
                  forgets what he really is, and claims a value that does not belong to him, he makes
                  himself completely ridiculous, and provokes the contempt of every one who knows him.

               <h2><span class="head">THE LION AND OTHER BEASTS HUNTING.</span></h2>
               <p><span class="smcap">The</span> wolf, the bull-dog, and the mountain-cat once agreed to go a hunting with the lion.
                  I have told you before what a terrible creature a lion is; a wolf is but a shrimp
                  to him; and ten bull-dogs together would scarcely venture to set upon a lion, though
                  he should be tied to a stake, and so prevented from following them whenever they chose
                  to run away. These creatures therefore were glad to have a lion for their partner,
                  who they knew was so much stronger than they; and the lion was contented to join them,
                  because various animals have various accomplishments, and at worst they could be set
                  at different openings of the forest to drive the prey into his mouth. You have not
                  forgotten that beasts of prey are obliged to go a hunting, as otherwise they would
                  starve. They cannot eat grass. The agreement of these partners was, that whatever
                  game any one of them should take, he was not to touch a morsel of it, till he had
                  called together his associates to be present at the division.</p>
               <p>Of the whole set the mountain-cat was the most cunning in her tricks, and she somehow
                  or other happened to catch a deer in her nets. What her nets were made of I cannot
                  tell; but it is only a fable, so we will not mind that. As soon as she perceived her
                  success, she very honourably sent round one of her kittens, to give notice to her
                  new-made friends. They hastened to the banquet; each of them brought along with him
                  the best sauce, which is hunger. As soon as they were assembled, the lion said, Now,
                  madam, and you two gentlemen, I dare say you have no objection to my being the carver;
                  I will divide the deer into quarters in a trice. </p>
               <p>Saying this, with one pat of his terrible paw he deprived the animal of life and then
                  set himself seriously to work. He divided the carcass with great expedition, and the
                  portions were so equal, that it was not possible for him who had any one of the shares,
                  to murmur because he had not one of the others. The partners looked on with great
                  earnestness and curiosity; their mouths watered; they licked their lips and were impatient
                  to be served. </p>
               <p>Well, my friends, have I divided our feast fairly? said the lion.—Every one praised
                  the magnanimity of their captain.</p>
               <p>I am glad, said he, you are so well satisfied with my proceedings. Now for the distribution!
                  This share, laying his paw upon one, I claim, because I am the king of beasts; nobody
                  will dispute that. This second share, touching another, I will have, in my own right
                  as the strongest and boldest of all the members of our association; the third, do
                  me the favour to observe, I will take in spite of your teeth; and as to the fourth,
                  I have only this to say, Let him touch it that dares!</p>
               <p>The poor animals were terribly mortified. They would have complained, and expostulated
                  with the lion upon his injustice. But he put himself into a threatening posture; and
                  they slunk away with their tails between their legs. He thought they did not vanish
                  quick enough, and set up one of his loudest roars; they then ran as fast as they could,
                  and sought in the remotest parts of the forest for any little morsel to appease the
                  cravings of hunger. It is too often thus, when one human creature has a great deal
                  more power than his neighbours; and therefore, if you should happen to be richer or
                  stronger than your brothers, or sisters, or play-mates, I hope you will be just enough
                  not to take the lion's share; and remember that it is not every one who has not the
                  courage to complain, that has not the right to do so if he dared. </p>

               tradition that included Sir Roger L'Estrange's <em>Fables of Aesop and Other Eminent Mythologists</em> (1692), Samuel Croxall's <em>The Fables of Aesop and Others</em> (1722), John Gay's <em>Fables. By Mr. Gay</em> (1727), Samuel Richardson's <em>Aesop's Fables</em> (1740), and Robert Dodsley's <em>Select Fables of Aesop and Other Fabulists in Three Books</em> (ca. 1800) among others.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3.. </span><span class="noteBody"><em>I have long thought...the curiosity of children are conversant</em>: Educational theorists throughout the eighteenth century debated the merits of fables
               for young children. In <em>Some Thoughts Concerning Education</em> (1692), John Locke deemed Aesop's fables to be ideal reading for children because
               they were both educational and entertaining. In <em>Émile, ou de l'Éducation</em> (1762), however, Jean Jacques Rousseau denounced fables as inappropriate for young
               children whom, he argued, would not understand their allegorical nature. Unlike Locke,
               Rousseau argues that fables tend to mislead in the course of amusing children: "How
               is it possible men can be so blind as to call fables the moral lectures for children,
               without reflecting that the apologue, in amusing, only deceives them; and that, seduced
               by the charms of falsehood, the truth couched underneath it escapes their notice?
               Yet, so it is; and the means which are thus taken to render instruction agreeable
               prevents their profiting by it. Fables may instruct grown persons, but the nake[d]
               truth should ever be presented to children." See <em>Emilius and Sophia: or a New System of Education</em>, vol. 1 (London: 1762), 184.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4.. </span><span class="noteBody"><em>Yet these advantages...they are read</em>: Godwin thought deeply about education—especially that proffered in Aesop's fables—long
               before he opened the Juvenile Library. In <em>The Enquirer. Reflections on Education, Manners, and Literature. In a Series of Essays</em> (London: 1797), Godwin criticizes the Aesop's fables currently available to readers
               for their attached morals, which he finds do not logically connect to the story itself:
               "Nothing is more futile, than the formal and regular moral frequently annexed to Esop's
               fables of animals. Examine the fable impartially, and you will find that the lesson
               set down at foot [<em>sic</em>] of it, is one of the last inferences that would have occurred to you. It is in a
               very different temper that the book maker squeezes out what he calls his Use, from
               that in which the reader becomes acquainted with the circumstances of the fable" (132-133).
               In his version, by contrast, Godwin does not append a moral to the story as Croxall
               does and occasionally withholds a moral altogether.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5.. </span><span class="noteBody"><em>But many fables in the commonest books of this sort are dimissed in five or six lines</em>: While Rousseau felt that fables were too complex for children's literal-minded capacities,
               Godwin believed that the fables currently available were too simple in their construction.
               The Aesop's fables edited by Robert Dodsley, Croxall, and L'Estrange are significantly

               the animals discussed, many of which were exotic animals that children were unlikely
               to have seen. While Godwin's version does include an illustration at the beginning

               do not remember the books they read: "It is of less importance, generally speaking,
               that a child should acquire this or that species of knowledge, than that, through

               Wild deer were all but nonexistant by the eighteenth century and the large, royal
               deer parks were greatly diminished during the English civil war, having been plundered
               of trees and game. For the most part, deer hunters chased "carted deer," which were
               sold commercially and brought in for the occasion. Carted deer were captured but typically

               largely in effect throughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Under
               this law, game animals—hares, partridges, pheasants, and moor fowl—were considered
               wild animals, available to anyone who had the right to hunt. Deer (and later rabbits),
               however, were designated as private property. Thus, hunting a deer without the permission
               of the owner of the land on which the deer was found was a theft. Until the law was
               repealed in 1831, someone found guilty of deer stealing risked transportation. Deer
               poaching—for individual consumption or for sale to inns and eating establishments—was

               the type of snake Cleopatra used to commit suicide. A <em>rattlesnake</em> is a lethally poisonous serpent indigenous to North America and distinguished by
               a series of bones in its tail that make a rattling sound. A <em>cerastes</em> is a poisonous viper found in Africa and parts of Asia and characterized by projecting
               horn-like scales above each eye. Finally, a <em>basilisk</em> is a mythological snake so powerful that its breath and glance (what Godwin terms
               its "eye-beam") were thought to be lethal.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note71_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               a neoclassical public building on the site; it was not fully completed until 1819.
               At various times it housed government offices, the Royal Society, the Society of Antiquaries,
               and the Royal Academy, to which Godwin refers here, since the Academy displayed casts
               of many famous sculptures. Specifically, Godwin likely alludes here to the monumental
               first or second century BCE marble statue <em>Laocoön and His Sons</em>. It is housed in the Vatican Museum, but Somerset House may have exhibited one of
               its many reproductions.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note74_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
