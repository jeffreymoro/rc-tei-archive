               <h2><span class="head">About this Edition</span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">This is the first installment of a complete critical edition of Godwin’s ten contributions
                  to his Juvenile Library. It makes available for the first time since 1824 the first
                  text that Godwin both authored and published under his own imprint, <em>Fables Ancient and Modern. Adapted for the Use of Children from Three to Eight Years
                     of Age</em> (1805), along with a comprehensive introduction and extensive notes by the editors.
                  While literary historians have long been aware that radical author William Godwin
                  wrote and published children's books, these works are substantially less visible than
                  his novels and philosophical writings. Yet, the profound cultural impact of Godwin's
                  children's literature—especially as an expression of his social politics—necessitates
                  their reproduction and welcomes further critical inquiry.</p>

               <p class="noCount"><span class="hi">Suzanne L. Barnett</span> received her PhD from the University of Pennsylvania in 2012 and is a Visiting Assistant
                  Professor in the English department of Manhattan College. She is currently at work
                  on her first book project, <em>Romantic Paganism: Ecstasy and Excess in the Shelley Circle</em>, in which she traces the uses of a distinctly "pagan" classical world in the works
                  of the second-generation romantics.</p>
               <p class="noCount"><span class="hi">Katherine Bennett Gustafson</span> studies the intersections between social and literary formation in the long eighteenth
                  century, in particular the history of Romantic children's literature, the rise of
                  the novel, and the histories of publishing, advertising, and readership. She is currently
                  working on her first book project, <em>Coming of Age: Adolescents, Publishers, and the Novel, 1719-1814</em>. Gustafson received her B.A. from Kenyon College and her Ph.D. from the University
                  of Pennsylvania. She will be joining Indiana University Northwest in the fall of 2014
                  as an Assistant Professor.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">About The Design</span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">This edition was designed at the University of Maryland by Michael Quilligan, Site
                  Manager at <em>Romantic Circles</em>. The initial transformation from WORD Doc to TEI P5 was made using the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.tei-c.org/oxgarage/#">OxGarage</a> tool, with further TEI markup modifications according to RC house style by Michael
                  Quilligan. TEI renders text archival quality for better preservation and future access.
                  Laura Mandell and Dave Rettenmaier developed the modified versions of the transforms
                  provided by the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</a> that were used to convert the TEI files into HTML. The image associated with this
                  edition includes elements from <a class="link_ref" href="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/godwin_fables/images/FablesTitle1807.jpg">William Mulready's Frontispiece from <em>Fables Ancient and Modern</em></a> (1807); Used <a class="link_ref" href="http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/id?1802345">courtesy of The New York Public Library</a>.</p>
