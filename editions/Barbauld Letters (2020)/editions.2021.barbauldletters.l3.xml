                    ourselves, we spent a fortnight at Clifton very agreeably in the society of the
                    Edgeworth family,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Richard Lovell Edgeworth
                        (1744–1817) and his daughter Maria (1767–1849), having published <title

                        to enjoy their new celebrity. ALB had met them in London earlier in 1799 and
                        visited them in Clifton before crossing to Wales with her and RB's friends
                        the Estlins. </note> which contained, besides the members of it you saw at
                    Hampstead, a neice of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Edgeworth’s a very cultivated

                    the Severn, but were disappointed in our view of seeing some of the beautiful
                    part of Wales by the weather, for it rained in torrents during our little
                    journey. We have been in this place a week yesterday, solely for the society of
                    our friends M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Estlin,<note
                        place="foot" resp="editors"> The Rev. John Prior Estlin (1747–1817), a
                        friend from Warrington Academy days, and his wife Susanna. They lived in
                        Bristol but kept a holiday cottage at Pitcot, near Bridgend in Wales.</note>
                    for of picturesque beauties this part of Glamorganshire has not much to boast,
                    except indeed in sea views, which are here very grand. The coast is bold &amp;
                    rocky, &amp; full of caverns. As the sea forms the grand feature of the country,
                    it is likewise the chief source of adventures. Every one has some tale to tell
                    of danger &amp; escape from that formidable enemy. One has been wrecked on the
                    sands &amp; brought off in a small boat which a breath of wind would have
                    overset. Another has been envellop’d while walking on the sands by a sudden fog
                    &amp; obliged </p>

                <p rend="noCount">[<emph>fol 1<hi rend="sup">v</hi></emph>] to feel his way back
                    amidst precipices &amp; the roar of waters. A third has been nearly carried away
                    by the current while bathing, &amp; a fourth overtaken by the tide in some of
                    the recesses of the rocks, &amp; nearly cut off from the possibility of return.
                    To the gloomy terror of these ideas, the weather, since we came here, has much
                    contributed, for we have not had one day free from rain &amp; some very stormy.
                    We have had fires every day, &amp; so has every body else that I have seen.
                    Besides the influence of the cool breezes from the sea, the walls are built with
                    sea sand which never thoroughly dries. There are no houses here to be had but
                    cottages, not like Lady Camelford’s,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Lady

                    woman, highly accomplished, &amp; a great addition to our party&#8212;We look up with
                    veneration to the little market town of Bridgend, which is four miles off, &amp;
                    I was obliged to send there for a pen before I could write to you&#8212;In short
                    nothing can be more compleat retirement than this place. I hear the Welsh
                    gutturals crackling all around me </p>

                <p rend="noCount">[<emph>fol 2<hi rend="sup">r</hi></emph>] &amp; I hope to morrow
                    to hear a sermon in Welsh, &amp; perhaps to assist at a meeting of jumpers, who
                    abound in this neighborhood.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> "Jumpers": "A

                    pleased with the look of the Welsh; they have black hair &amp; black lively
                    eyes, with an expression of vigour &amp; chearfulness; many of the women are
                    without shoes &amp; stockings&#8212;M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Estlin says they are a very

                    abroad upon the common without any body to watch them&#8212;Now for our plans. I beg
                    you will tell M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Rickards how much [<emph>tear</emph>] her

                    are kept at home &amp; kept by so distressing a circumstance. Pray remember me
                    to the poor sufferer. She has our sympathy &amp; best wishes. We intend to cross
                    the water from hence to Minehead<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Minehead is

                    it may be delayed some days for weather; otherwise it will be very convenient,
                    for we are to go with a gentleman of Bridgend, who is taking his son to M<hi
