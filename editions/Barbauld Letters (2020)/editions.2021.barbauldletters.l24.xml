                    weather we are not likely to be troubled again this season, but I feel I am fast
                    approaching the season when, as Solomon tells us, every thing, even the
                    grasshopper is a burden. I hope however I shall feel it last in those exertions

                    not pass a certain house in Church Street without a sigh&#8212;I was at West

                    sees. He treats us all very freely, but Birmingham he particularly abuses, for
                    which reason I do not know whether I must recommend it to you. The Spaniard’s
                    cloak however by no means hides the Englishman’s skirts, &amp; the real author
